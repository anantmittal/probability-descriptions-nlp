        The Mathematical Impossibility Of Evolution        PDF     ICR began publishing its popular free newsletter Acts & Facts in June 1972, over 31 years ago. The first two issues were 6-page, single-column, fold-over tract-like papers, black-and-white—not very impressive in appearance.  Issue No. 1 contained only news items describing some of our early campus meetings. Specially featured was the meeting held by Dr. Duane Gish on the Davis campus of the University of California. This was the meeting that involved an unscheduled 2½ hour debate with world-famous evolutionist, G. Ledyard Stebbins. A favorable response from the large student attendance and a very positive write-up in the student paper eventually led to Dr. Gish's famous cartoon booklet, Have You Been Brainwashed? which has been greatly used by the Lord in the past three decades, being distributed in the millions all over the world.  That issue also announced the publication of Dr. Gish's first book, Evolution: The Fossils Say No! which has been used widely and has won many evolutionists to accept the truth of special creation.  Issue No. 2 also was mostly news, but it did contain a semi-technical article on "The Mathematical Impossibility of Evolution" which is being reproduced herein as a matter of interest—not only of historical interest as the forerunner of our popular Impact articles (the first of which was published in the first 1973 issue), but also because it still seems to show in a very simple way that evolution is impossible—no one, to my knowledge, has ever tried to refute it.  The third issue of Acts & Facts reported on the first ICR-sponsored expedition to Mount Ararat in search of Noah's Ark, led by John Morris. The first Impact article, however, was published in the January/February 1973 issue on the subject, "Evolution, Creation, and the Public Schools , " urging that concerned citizens should use an educational and persuasion approach, rather than legislation or litigation, in trying to get a balanced approach to origins teaching accepted in the public schools.  In spite of this advice, however, many well-meaning creationists have tried—always unsuccessfully—to try to force this issue. We still recommend education and persuasion as the best policy.  Anyway, an Impact article on significant scientific or apologetics topics has been published every month since that first 1973 Acts & Facts . The forerunner of all these, still quite valid, I believe, is reproduced with a few modifications below:  The Mathematical Impossibility of Evolution  According to the most-widely accepted theory of evolution today, the sole mechanism for producing evolution is that of random mutation combined with natural selection. Mutations are random changes in genetic systems. Natural selection is considered by evolutionists to be a sort of sieve, which retains the "good" mutations and allows the others to pass away.  Since random changes in ordered systems almost always will decrease the amount of order in those systems, nearly all mutations are harmful to the organisms which experience them. Nevertheless, the evolutionist insists that each complex organism in the world today has arisen by a long string of gradually accumulated good mutations preserved by natural selection. No one has ever actually observed a genuine mutation occurring in the natural environment which was beneficial (that is, adding useful genetic information to an existing genetic code), and therefore, retained by the selection process. For some reason, however, the idea has a certain persuasive quality about it and seems eminently reasonable to many people—until it is examined quantitatively , that is!  For example, consider a very simple putative organism composed of only 200 integrated and functioning parts, and the problem of deriving that organism by this type of process. The system presumably must have started with only one part and then gradually built itself up over many generations into its 200-part organization. The developing organism, at each successive stage, must itself be integrated and functioning in its environment in order to survive until the next stage. Each successive stage, of course, becomes statistically less likely than the preceding one, since it is far easier for a complex system to break down than to build itself up. A four-component integrated system can more easily "mutate" (that is, somehow suddenly change) into a three-component system (or even a four-component non-functioning system) than into a five-component integrated system. If, at any step in the chain, the system mutates "downward," then it is either destroyed altogether or else moves backward, in an evolutionary sense.  Therefore, the successful production of a 200-component functioning organism requires, at least , 200 successive, successful such "mutations," each of which is highly unlikely. Even evolutionists recognize that true mutations are very rare, and beneficial mutations are extremely rare—not more than one out of a thousand mutations are beneficial, at the very most.  But let us give the evolutionist the benefit of every consideration. Assume that, at each mutational step, there is equally as much chance for it to be good as bad. Thus, the probability for the success of each mutation is assumed to be one out of two, or one-half. Elementary statistical theory shows that the probability of 200 successive mutations being successful is then (½) 200 , or one chance out of 10 60 . The number 10 60 , if written out, would be "one" followed by sixty "zeros." In other words, the chance that a 200-component organism could be formed by mutation and natural selection is less than one chance out of a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion! Lest anyone think that a 200-part system is unreasonably complex, it should be noted that even a one-celled plant or animal may have millions of molecular "parts."  The evolutionist might react by saying that even though any one such mutating organism might not be successful, surely some around the world would be, especially in the 10 billion years (or 10 18 seconds) of assumed earth history. Therefore, let us imagine that every one of the earth's 10 14 square feet of surface harbors a billion (i.e., 10 9 ) mutating systems and that each mutation requires one-half second (actually it would take far more time than this). Each system can thus go through its 200 mutations in 100 seconds and then, if it is unsuccessful, start over for a new try. In 10 18 seconds, there can, therefore, be 10 18 /10 2 , or 10 16 , trials by each mutating system. Multiplying all these numbers together, there would be a total possible number of attempts to develop a 200-component system equal to 10 14 (10 9 ) (10 16 ), or 10 39 attempts. Since the probability against the success of any one of them is 10 60 , it is obvious that the probability that just one of these 10 39 attempts might be successful is only one out of 10 60 /10 39 , or 10 21 .  All this means that the chance that any kind of a 200-component integrated functioning organism could be developed by mutation and natural selection just once, anywhere in the world, in all the assumed expanse of geologic time, is less than one chance out of a billion trillion. What possible conclusion, therefore, can we derive from such considerations as this except that evolution by mutation and natural selection is mathematically and logically indefensible!  Discussion   There have been many other ways in which creationist writers have used probability arguments to refute evolutionism, especially the idea of random changes preserved, if beneficial, by natural selection. James Coppedge devoted almost an entire book, Evolution: Possible or Impossible (Zondervan, 1973, 276 pp.), to this type of approach. I have also used other probability-type arguments to the same end (see, e.g., Science and Creation , Master Books, pp. 161-201).  The first such book, so far as I know, to use mathematics and probability in refuting evolution was written by a pastor, W. A. Williams, way back in 1928. Entitled, Evolution Disproved , it made a great impression on me when I first read it about 1943, at a time when I myself was still struggling with evolution.  In fact, evolutionists themselves have attacked traditional Darwinism on the same basis (see the Wistar Institute Symposium, Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution, 1967, 140 pp.). While these scientists did not reject evolution itself, they did insist that the Darwinian randomness postulate would never work.  Furthermore, since the law of increasing entropy, or the second law of thermodynamics, is essentially a statement of probabilities, many writers have also used that law itself to show that evolution on any significant scale is essentially impossible. Evolutionists have usually ignored the arguments or else used vacuous arguments against them ("Anything can happen given enough time"; "The earth is an open system, so the second law doesn't apply"; "Order can arise out of chaos through dissipative structures"; etc.).  In the real world of scientific observation, as opposed to metaphysical speculation, however, no more complex system can ever "evolve" out of a less complex system, so the probability of the naturalistic origin of even the simplest imaginary form of life is zero.  The existence of complexity of any kind is evidence of God and creation. "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth" ( Isaiah 40:26 ).

The odds that evolution is true have actually been calculated.    Not surprisingly, a huge number of scientists have tried to calculate the probability of life arising by a chemical accident. The results of their calculations reveal the enormity of the dilemma faced by evolutionists. In the 1970’s British astronomer Sir Frederick Hoyle, an evolutionist, set out to calculate the mathematical probability of the spontaneous origin of life from a primordial soup environment.  Applying the laws of chemistry, mathematical probability and thermodynamics, he calculated the odds of the spontaneous generation of the simplest known free-living life form on earth - a bacterium. He determined that the probability of such an event is one chance in ten to the 40 thousandth power. Hoyle stated: “the likelihood of the formation of life from inanimate matter is one to a number with 40 thousand zeros after it. It is enough to bury Darwin and the whole theory of evolution, he said.  Mathematicians tell us if an event has a probability which is less likely than one chance in 10 to just the 50th power, then that event is mathematically impossible. Again we’re talking about one chance in ten to the 40 thousandth power. Prior to his project, Hoyle was a believer in the spontaneous generation of life. This project, however, changed his opinion 180 degrees. Now look around you at the abundance of life you see. How impossible is it that all of what you observed just accidentally formed. If you’re honest with yourself, you must admit the odds of it being accidental are impossible. The only other option is that it was created by God.

By JOHN ALLEN PAULOS  Sept. 3, 2006   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      A recent international study in the journal Science by Professor Jon Miller of Michigan State University and his associates finds that a growing number of Americans do not believe in the theory of evolution. In fact, the survey of 32 European nations and Japan reveals that only Turkey has a higher percentage of its citizens rejecting Darwin. The author attributes the results in the United States to religious fundamentalism, inadequate science education, and partisan political maneuvering. With regard to the latter Miller notes, "There is no major political party in Europe and Japan that uses opposition to evolution as a part of its political platform." But there's another contributing factor to this opposition to evolution that I'd like to discuss here. It is the concerted attempt by creationists to dress up in the garb of mathematics fundamentalist claims about human origins and to focus criticism on what they take to be the minuscule probability of evolutionary development. (Even the conservative television pundit and ace biologist Ann Coulter has lent her perspicacity to this mathematical endeavor in her recent book.) Creationists argue that the likelihood of, say, a new species of horse developing is absurdly tiny. The same, they say, is true of the development of the eye or the mechanism for blood clotting.  Creationists' Argument  A bit more specifically, the standard argument goes roughly as follows. A very long sequence of individually improbable mutations must occur in order for a species or a biological process to evolve. If we assume these are independent events, then the probability of all of them occurring and occurring in the right order is the product of their respective probabilities, which is always an extremely tiny number. Thus, for example, the probability of getting a 3, 2, 6, 2, and 5 when rolling a single die five times is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 or 1/7,776 -- one chance in 7,776. The much longer sequences of fortuitous events necessary for a new species or a new process to evolve leads to the minuscule numbers that creationists argue prove that evolution is so wildly improbable as to be essentially impossible.   The Flaw  This line of argument, however, is deeply flawed. Leaving aside the issue of independent events, which is too extensive to discuss here, I note that there are always a fantastically huge number of evolutionary paths that might be taken by an organism (or a process) over time. I also note that there is only one that actually will be taken. So if, after the fact, we observe the particular evolutionary path actually taken and then calculate the a priori probability of its being taken, we will get the minuscule probability that creationists mistakenly attach to the process as a whole. Misunderstanding this tiny probability, they reject outright the evolutionary process. Here's another example. We have a deck of cards before us. There are almost 10 to the 68th power -- a one with 68 zeroes after it -- orderings of the 52 cards in the deck. Any of the 52 cards might be first, any of the remaining 51 second, any of the remaining 50 third, and so on. This is a humongous number, but it's not hard to devise even everyday situations that give rise to much larger numbers. Now if we shuffle this deck of cards for a long time and then examine the particular ordering of the cards that happens to result, we would be justified in concluding that the probability of this particular ordering of the cards having occurred is approximately 1 chance in 10 to the 68th power. This certainly qualifies as minuscule. Still, we would not be justified in concluding that the shuffles could not have possibly resulted in this particular ordering because its a priori probability is so very tiny. Some ordering had to result from the shuffling, and this one did. Nor, of course, would we be justified in concluding that the whole process of moving from one ordering to another via shuffles is so wildly improbable as to be practically impossible. The actual result of the shufflings will always have a minuscule probability of occurring, but, unless you're a creationist, that doesn't mean the process of obtaining the result is at all dubious.  The Science study is disturbing for many reasons, not the least of which is that there's no telling to what length the creationist trunk of the G.O.P. elephant will evolve.

Return to main evolution page    David H. Bailey 14 February 2018 (c) 2018  Introduction Both traditional creationists and intelligent design writers have invoked probability arguments in criticisms of biological evolution. They argue that certain features of biology are so fantastically improbable that they could never have been produced by a purely natural, "random" process, even assuming the billions of years of history asserted by geologists and astronomers.  They often equate the hypothesis of evolution to the absurd suggestion that monkeys randomly typing at a typewriter could compose a selection from the works of Shakepeare, or that an explosion in an aerospace equipment yard could produce a working 747 airliner [ Dembski1998 ; Foster1991 ; Hoyle1981 ; Lennox2009 ]. One creationist-intelligent design argument goes like this: the human alpha-globin molecule, a component of hemoglobin that performs a key oxygen transfer function, is a protein chain based on a sequence of 141 amino acids.  There are 20 different amino acids common in living systems, so the number of potential chains of length 141 is 20 141 , which is roughly 10 183 (i.e., a one followed by 183 zeroes).  These writers argue that this figure is so enormous that even after billions of years of random molecular trials, no human alpha-globin protein molecule would ever appear "at random," and thus the hypothesis that human alpha-globin arose by an evolutionary process is decisively refuted  [ Foster1991 , pg. 79-83; Hoyle1981 , pg. 1-20; Lennox2009 , pg. 163-173]. The treacherous world of probability and statistics While not generally appreciated by the public at large, it is a well-known fact in the world of scientific research that arguments based on probability and statistics are fraught with potential fallacies and errors. For these reasons, rigorous courses in probability and statistics are now required of students in virtually all fields of science, and in numerous other disciplines as well.  Attorneys need to be at least moderately well-versed in probability and statistics arguments and how they can go awry in the courtroom arguments [ Saini2009 ]. In the finance world, statistical overfitting and other errors of probability and statistics are now thought to be a leading reason behind the fact that strategies and investment funds which look great on paper often disappoint in real-world usage [ Bailey2014 ]. To illustrate the difficulties with probability arguments, mathematics teachers often ask their class (let's say it has 30 students) if they think it is likely that two or more persons in the class have exactly the same birthday.  Most students say that it is highly unlikely, thinking that the chances that two people have the same particular birthday is 1/365, and so 30 times this amount is only 30/365. But this argument is fallacious, since, for example, in a class of 30 students there are 435 pairs of students.  When the probability calculation is done correctly for the case of 30 students [it is equal to 1 - (364/365 x 363/365 x ... x 336/365)], one obtains 70.6%.  In general, if there are 23 or more students in the class, then the chances that two or more have the same birthday is greater than 50%. For numerous other examples of how seemingly improbable "coincidences" can happen, see [ Hand2014 ]. Fallacies in the creationist probability arguments One major fallacy in the alpha-globin argument mentioned above, common to many others of this genre, is that it ignores the fact that a large class of alpha-globin molecules can perform the essential oxygen transfer function, so that the computation of the probability of a single instance is misleadingly remote.  Indeed, most of the 141 amino acids in alpha-globin can be changed without altering the key oxygen transfer function, as can be seen by noting the great variety in alpha-globin molecules across the animal kingdom (see DNA ).
When one revises the calculation above, based on only 25 locations essential for the oxygen transport function (which is a generous over-estimate), one obtains 10 33 fundamentally different chains, a enormous figure but vastly smaller than 10 183 . A calculation such as this can be refined further, taking into account other features of alpha-globin and its related biochemistry.  Some of these calculations produce probability values even more extreme than the above.  But do any of these calculations really matter? The main problem is that all such calculations, whether done accurately or not, suffer from the fatal fallacy of presuming that a structure such as human alpha-globin arose by a single all-at-once random trial event. But generating a molecule "at random" in a single shot is decidedly not the scientific hypothesis in question -- this is a creationist theory, not a scientific theory.  Instead, available evidence from hundreds of published studies on the topic has demonstrated that alpha-globin arose as the end product of a long sequence of intermediate steps, each of which was biologically useful in an earlier context.  See, for example, the survey article [ Hardison2001 ], which cites 144 papers on the topic of hemoglobin evolution. In short, it does not matter how good or how bad the mathematics used in the analysis is, if the underlying model is a fundamentally invalid description of the phenomenon in question.  Any simplistic probability calculation of evolution that does not take into account the step-by-step process by which the structure came to be is almost certainly fallacious and can easily mislead [ Musgrave1998 ]. What's more, such calculations completely ignore the atomic-level biochemical processes involved, which often exhibit strong affinities for certain types of highly ordered structures.  For example, molecular self-assembly occurs in DNA molecule duplication every time a cell divides.  If we were to compute the chances of the formation of a human DNA molecule during meiosis, using a simple-minded probability calculation similar to that mentioned above, the result would be something on the order of one in 10 1,000,000,000 , which is far, far beyond the possibility of "random" assemblage.  Yet this process occurs millions of times every day in the human body. Is evolution a "random" process? It is also important to keep in mind that the process of natural biological evolution is not really a "random" process.  Evolution certainly has some "random" aspects, notably mutations and genetic events during reproduction.  But the all-important process of natural selection, acting under the pressure of an extremely competitive landscape, often involving thousands of other individuals of the same species and other species as well, together with numerous complicated environmental pressures such as climate change, is anything but random.  This strongly directional nature of natural selection, which is the essence of evolution, by itself invalidates most of these probability calculations. Hemoglobin and chlorophyll With regards to hemoglobin, in particular, it has long been noted that heme, the key oxygen-carrying component of hemoglobin, is remarkably similar to chlorophyll, the molecule behind photosynthesis.  The principal difference is that heme has a central iron atom, whereas chlorophyll has a central magnesium atom; otherwise they are virtually identical.  This similarity can hardly be a coincidence, and in fact researchers concluded long ago that these two biomolecules must have shared a common lineage (meaning, of course, that organisms which incorporate these biomolecules must have shared a common lineage) [ Hendry1980 ].  Here is a diagram of the two molecules [from MasterOrganicChemistry.com ]:   Snowflakes Some of the difficulties with creationist probability arguments can be illustrated by considering snowflakes.  Bentley and Humphrey's book Snow Crystals includes over 2000 high-resolution black-and-white photos of real snowflakes, each with intricate yet highly regular patterns that are almost perfectly six-way symmetric [ Bentley1962 ].  A good online source with numerous high-resolution photographs has been compiled by Kenneth Libbrecht [ Libbrecht2012 ].  Four of Bentley's photos are shown below.  By employing a reckoning based on six-way symmetry, one can calculate the chances that one of these structures can form "at random" as roughly one part in 10 2500 .  This probability figure is even more extreme than some that have appeared in the creationist-intelligent design literature.  So is this proof that each individual snowflake has been designed by a supernatural intelligent entity?  Obviously not. The fallacy here, once again, is presuming an all-at-once random assembly of molecules.  Instead, snowflakes, like biological organisms, are formed as the product of a long series of steps acting under well-known physical laws, and the outcomes of such processes very sensitively depend on the starting conditions and numerous environmental parameters.  It is thus folly to presume that one can correctly reckon the chances of a given outcome by means of superficial probability calculations that ignore the processes by which they formed.        Can English text be generated "at random"? As mentioned above, some critics have equated the notion of natural evolution to the absurd suggestion that some monkeys typing randomly at a keyboard could generate a passage of Shakespeare.  But this too is a fallacious argument. A recent study exhibited results of a computer program simulating natural evolution, which "evolved" segments of English text very much akin to actual passages from Charles Dickens.  In many instances, a class of college students were unable to distinguish the computer-generated text segments from real text segments taken from Dickens' Great Expectations .  See English-text for details. Along this line, computer programs have been written that mimic the process of biological evolution to produce novel solutions to engineering problems, in many cases superior to the best human efforts, in an approach that has been termed "genetic algorithms" or "evolutionary computing."  As a single example, in 2017 Google researchers generated 1000 image recognition algorithms, each of which were trained using state-of-the-art deep neural networks to recognize a selected set of images.  They then used an array of 250 computers, each running two algorithms, to identify an image.  Only the algorithm that scored higher proceeded to the next iteration, where it was changed somewhat, mimicking mutations in natural evolution. Google researchers found that their scheme could achieve accuracies as high as 94.6% [ Gershgorn2017 ]. Closely related are advances in artificial intelligence, in which a set of computer programs "compete" to produce a superior program.  One notable example is the 2016 defeat of the world's top Go player by a computer program named AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, in an event that surprised observers who had not expected this for decades, if ever.  Then in 2017, DeepMind announced even more remarkable results: their researchers had started from scratch, programming a computer with only the rules of Go, together with a "deep learning" algorithm, and then had the program play games against itself.  Within a few days it had advanced to the point that it defeated the earlier champion-beating AlphaGo program 100 games to zero.  After one month, the program's rating was as far above the world champion as the world champion was above a typical amateur [ Greenmeier2017 ]. As an example of the many mathematical studies of evolution, researchers showed mathematically that there was plenty of time in the geologic record for evolution to have produced the complexity in nature [ Wilf2010 ]. Improbable structures and features in nature Numerous examples from the natural world can be cited to demonstrate the futility of trying to argue against evolution using probability -- nature can and often does produce highly improbable structures and features, by the normal process of evolution:  Lenski's 2012 E. coli experiment : In January 2012, a research team led by Richard Lenski at Michigan State University demonstrated that colonies of viruses can evolve a new trait in as little as 15 days.  The researchers studied a virus, known as "lambda," which infects only the bacterium E. coli.  They engineered a strain of E. coli that had almost none of the molecules that this virus normally attaches to, then released them into the virus colony.  In 24 of 96 separate experimental lines, the viruses evolved a strain that enabled them to attach to E. coli, using a new molecule that they had never before been observed to utilize.  All of the successful runs utilized essentially the same set of four distinct mutations.  Justin Meyer, a member of the research team, noted that the chances of all four mutations arising "at random" in a given experimental line (based on a superficial probability argument) are roughly one in 10 27 (one thousand trillion trillion) [ Zimmer2012 ].  Note also that the chances for this to happen in 24 out of 96 experimental lines are roughly one in 10 626 .   Synthesis of RNA nucleotides and other biomolecules :  Many scientists hypothesize that RNA (a molecule similar to DNA) was involved in the origin of life (see Origin ).  But as recently as a few years ago, even producing the four nucleotides (components) of RNA on the primitive Earth was  thought to be a "near miracle."  Nonetheless, in May 2009 a team led by John Sutherland of the University of Manchester discovered a particular combination of chemicals, very likely to have been plentiful on the early Earth, that formed the RNA nucleotide ribocytidine phosphate.  By exposing the mixture to ultraviolet light, a second nucleotide of RNA was formed [ Wade2009 ].  Then in May 2016, one of the remaining two was synthesized, by a team in Munich, Germany [ Service2016 ].  Sutherland's group also recently showed that two simple compounds, which almost certainly were abundant on the early Earth, can launch a cascade of chemical reactions that can produce all three major classes of biomolecules: nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids [ Wade2015a ].  In short, the natural production of biomolecules once thought to be "impossible" is now fairly well understood.   Hawaiian crickets : In the 1990s, a population of crickets in Hawaii (a species introduced to the islands over 100 years ago) became victims of dive-bombing flies that targeted male crickets who were chirping to attract mates, then implanted their larvae in them.  Recently, when researchers visited a region in Kauai that previously was the home to many of these chirping crickets, it was now completely silent, and they feared the crickets were now extinct in the area.  Fortunately, nighttime searches found that in fact there were lots of crickets there, but very few of the males now chirped.  Further study found that in just five years, or roughly 20 generations, a rather improbable mutation had arisen that inhibited the males from chirping, and this genetic trait had now spread to almost the entire population [ Zuk2013 , pg. 81-82].   Tibetan high-altitude genes : In 2010, researchers analyzing DNA found that natives of the Tibetan highlands possess 30 unique genes that permit them to live well at very high altitudes: the genes foster more efficient metabolism, prevent the overproduction of red blood cells, and generate higher levels of substances that transmit oxygen to tissue.  Given that the Tibetans separated from other Han Chinese only about 3,000 years ago, this is thought to be one of the fastest documented cases of evolution in humans [ Wade2010b ].  Many other examples could be listed -- see Novelty and Origin . Dembski's information theory arguments Intelligent design writer William Dembski invokes both probability and information theory (the mathematical theory of information content in data) in his arguments against Darwinism [e.g., Dembski2002 ].  However, mathematicians who have examined Dembski's works have identified major flaws in his reasoning [ Elsberry2011 ].  For a detailed discussion of Dembski's theories, see Information theory . Does creationism provide a reasonable alternative? Does a creationist worldview, in particular the hypothesis of independent creation of each species with no common biological ancestry, provide a reasonable alternative in terms of probability? Here it is instructive to consider transposons or "jumping genes," namely sections of DNA that have been "copied" from one part of an organism's genome and "pasted" seemingly at random in other locations.  The human genome, for example, has over four million individual transposons in over 800 families [ Mills2007 ].  In most cases transposons do no harm, because they "land" in an unused section of DNA, but because they are inherited they serve as excellent markers for genetic studies.  Indeed, transposons have been used to classify a large number of vertebrate species into a family tree, with a result that is virtually identical to what biologists had earlier reckoned based only physical features and biological functions [ Rogers2011 , pg. 25-31, 86-92].  As just one example, consider the following table, where columns labeled ABCDE denote five blocks of transposons, and x and o denote that the block is present or absent in the genome [ Rogers2011 , pg. 89]. Transposon blocks
			Species		A	B	C	D	E
        /---------	Human		o	x	x	x	x
       /----------	Bonobo		x	x	x	x	x
      / \---------	Chimp		x	x	x	x	x
     /------------	Gorilla		o	o	x	x	x
-----|------------	Orangutan	o	o	o	x	x
     \------------	Gibbon		o	o	o	o	o It is clear from these data that our closest primate relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos.  As another example, here is a classification of four cetaceans (ocean mammals) based on transposon data  [ Rogers2011 , pg. 27]: Transposon blocks
		Species			A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P
    /------	Bottlenose dolphin	x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x
   /\------	Narwhal whale		x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x
---|-------	Sperm whale		x  x  x  x  x  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o
   \-------	Humpback whale		x  x  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o Other examples could be listed, encompassing an even broader range of species [ Rogers2011 , pg. 25-31, 86-92]. Needless to say, these data, which all but scream "descent from common ancestors," are highly problematic for creationists and others who hold that the individual species were separately created without common biological ancestry.  Transposons typically are several thousand DNA base pair letters long, but, since there are often some disagreements from species to species, let us be very conservative and say only 1000 base pair letters long.  Then for two species to share even one transposon starting at the same spot, presumably only due to random mutations since creation, the probability (according to the creationist hypothesis) is one in 4 1000 or roughly one in 10 600 .  For 16 such common transposons, the chances are one in 4 16000 or roughly one in 10 9600 .  What's more, as mentioned above, an individual species typically has at least several hundred thousand such transposons.  Including even part of these in the reckoning would hugely multiply these odds. But this is not all, because we have not yet considered the fact that in each diagram above, or in other tables of real biological transposon data, there is a clear hierarchical relationship.  This is by no means assured, and in fact is quite improbable -- for almost all tables of "random" data, there is no hierarchical pattern, and no way to the rearrange the rows to be in a hierarchical pattern.  For example, in a computer run programmed by the present author, each column of the above cetacean table was pseudorandomly shuffled (thus maintaining the same number of x and o in each column), and the program checked whether the rows of the resulting table could be rearranged to be in a hierarchical order.  There were no successes in 10,000,000 trials.  As a second experiment, a 4 x 16 table of pseudorandom data (with a 50-50 chance of x or o) was generated, and then the program attempted to rearrange the rows to be in a hierarchical pattern as before.  There were only three successes in 10,000,000 trials. Like the calculations mentioned earlier, these calculations are simplified and informal; more careful reckonings can be done, and one can vary the underlying assumptions.  But, again, do the fine details of the calculations really matter?  One way or the other, it is clear that the creationist hypothesis of separate creation does not resolve any probability paradoxes; instead it enormously magnifies them.  The only other possibility, from a strict creationist worldview, is to posit that a supreme being separately created species with hundreds of thousands of transposons already in place, essentially just as we see them today.  But this merely replaces a scientific disaster (the utter failure of the creationist model to explain the vast phylogenetic patterns in intron data) with a theological disaster (why did a truth-loving supreme being fill the genomes of the entire biological kingdom with vast amounts of misleading DNA evidence, all pointing unambiguously to an evolutionary descent from common ancestors, if that is not the conclusion we are to draw?).  Indeed, with regards to the discomfort some have about evolution, the creationist alternative of separate creation is arguably far worse, both scientifically and theologically. Conclusions It is undeniably true that there are some perplexing features of evolution from the point of view of probability.  Even at the molecular level, structures are seen that appear to be exceedingly improbable.  What is the origin of these structures?  How did they evolve to the forms we see today?  In spite of many published papers on these topics, researchers in the field would be the first to acknowledge that there is still much that is not yet fully understood. However, arguments based on probability, statistics or information theory that have appeared in the creationist-intelligent design literature do not help unravel these mysteries, because most of these arguments have serious fallacies:  They presume that a given biomolecule came into existence "at random" via an all-at-once chance assemblage of atoms.  But this is not the scientific hypothesis of how they formed; instead, numerous published studies, covering many biomolecules, indicate that these biomolecules were the result of a long series of intermediate steps over the eons, each useful in a previous biological context. Thus such arguments are fundamentally flawed from the beginning.  They apply faulty mathematical reasoning, such as by ignoring the fact that a very wide range of biomolecules could perform a similar function to the given biomolecule.  Thus the odds they provide against the formation of the given biomolecule are greatly exaggerated.  They ignore the fact that biological evolution is fundamentally not a purely "random" process -- mutations may be random, but natural selection is far from random.  They ignore reams of evidence from the natural world that evolution can and often does produce highly improbable structures and features.  Some writers attempt to invoke advanced mathematical concepts (e.g., information theory), but derive highly questionable results and misapply these results in ways that render the conclusions invalid in an evolutionary biology context.  The creationist hypothesis of separate creation for each species does not resolve any probability paradoxes; instead it enormously magnifies them.  It is ironic that to the extent that such probability-based arguments have any validity at all, it is precisely the creationist hypothesis of separate, all-at-once complete formation that is falsified. Perhaps at some time in the distant future, a super-powerful computer will be able simulate with convincing fidelity the multi-billion-year biological history of the earth, in the same way that scientists today attempt to simulate (in a much more modest scope) the earth's weather and climate.  Then, after thousands of such simulations have been performed, with different starting conditions, we might obtain some meaningful statistics on the chances involved in the origin of life, or in the formation of some class of biological structures such as hemoglobin, or in the rise of intelligent creatures such as ourselves. Until that time, probability calculations such as those that appear in creationist-intelligent design literature should be viewed with great skepticism, to say the least. In a larger context, one has to question whether highly technical issues such as calculations of probabilities have any place in a discussion of religion.  Why attempt to "prove" God with probability, particularly when there are very serious questions as to whether such reasoning is valid?  One is reminded of a passage in the New Testament:  "For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?" [1 Cor. 14:8].  It makes far more sense to leave such matters to peer-reviewed scientific research. See DNA , English text , Information theory , Origin and Deceiver for additional related discussion.

Home The Probability of Life       Creationists have long asserted that the chances of life forming naturally are so remote that they could not have happened. Read about how, in fact, the chances are much wider than most think.  by Richard Peacock      Creationists often claim that the chances of a modern enzyme forming by random means are astronomically small, and therefore the chances of a complete bacterium (which is composed of hundreds or thousands of such enzymes & proteins) is so near to impossible that it would never happen in the 13 billion years or so since the universe took shape.  The main problem with this argument is that it assumes abiogenesis (the initial formation of life from simpler molecules) was a totally random process. It also assumes that in order for abiogenesis to be successful, a complete microbe would have had to form spontaneously. In fact, the same non-random forces which propel biological evolution also propelled abiogenesis. Specifically, Natural Selection.  The calculation which supports the creationist argument begins with the probability of a 300-molecule-long protein forming by total random chance. This would be approximately 1 chance in 10 390 . This number is astoundingly huge. By comparison, the number of all the atoms in the observable universe is 10 80 . So, if a simple protein has that unlikely chance of forming, what hope does a complete bacterium have?  If this were the theory of abiogeneisis, and if it relied entirely on random chance, then yes, it would be impossible for life to form in this way. However, this is not the case.  Abiogenesis was a long process with many small incremental steps, all governed by the non-random forces of Natural Selection and chemistry. The very first stages of abiogenesis were no more than simple self-replicating molecules, which might hardly have been called alive at all.  For example, the simplest theorized self-replicating peptide is only 32 amino acids long. The probability of it forming randomly, in sequential trials, is approximately 1 in 10 40 , which is much more likely than the 1 in 10 390 claim creationists often cite.  Though, to be fair, 10 40 is still a very large number. It would still take an incredibly large number of sequential trials before the peptide would form. But remember that in the prebiotic oceans of the early Earth, there would be billions of trials taking place simultaneously as the oceans, rich in amino acids, were continuously churned by the tidal forces of the moon and the harsh weather conditions of the Earth.  In fact, if we assume the volume of the oceans were 10 24 liters, and the amino acid concentration was 10 -6 M (which is actually very dilute), then almost 10 31 self-replicating peptides would form in under a year, let alone millions of years. So, even given the difficult chances of 1 in 10 40 , the first stages of abiogenesis could have started very quickly indeed.   Please note: this article uses a hypothetical self-replicating peptide as a model molecule for these calculations.  The current theories of abiogenesis are usually based on the "RNA World" theory, where in fact self-replication was first acheived through RNA molecules, rather than DNA molecules.

One of the breakout sessions featured a fellow from the Heritage Foundation (an ultra-right-wing political think tank) presenting a lecture about probability and evolution.  His talk was mostly just a watered-down version of William Dembski’s standard talking points.  His triumphant conclusion was that the probability of something or other having evolved by natural processes was one over something enormous, from which he concluded that evolution had been refuted.  There were only about fifteen of us in the room.  During the subsequent question period, one older gentleman said something very close to this: “When scientists are confronted with a probability that small…”  He paused here, as though struggling to accept just how small a number it was.  “What else can they do but just stare at it helplessly?”  I was the next to speak.  I said, “I think I can tell you how they would react to that calculation.  They would question the legitimacy of the assumptions that went into it.”  I then rattled off three implausible assumptions underlying the calculation.  The other fellow just stared at me.  The speaker, incredibly, replied that this was just a popular level presentation, and then rattled off several additional points of disanalogy between his calculation and reality.  He seemed to think that was a good answer.  I replied that the problem wasn’t simply that certain details had been left out of the calculation to keep it manageable.  It was that the variables that were missing could not be quantified with any accuracy.  Consequently, absolutely nothing like what he was doing could be made to work.  He just shrugged and went on to the next question.  Creationists love probability.  If you are a speaker trying to bamboozle a lay audience, there is no better way than to drop in a back-of-the-envelope calculation.  The trouble is that the things they are trying to quantify are inherently unquantifiable.  There is no way to calculate the probability of an eye, for example, evolving over the course of millions of years of evolution by natural selection.  The young-Earthers typically try to circumvent this point by ignoring the role of selection.  They typically toss off combinatorial arguments in which the probability of evolving some complex molecule, like hemoglobin, is taken to be one over the number of ways of arranging the amino acids in that molecule.  Sadly, that only works if all of those arrangements are equiprobable, but the continuing action of natural selection ensures that they are not.  The ID folks try to gum up the works with blather about specificity or universal probability bounds.  But when it comes time to perform specific probability calculations (something they almost never do) they inevitably invoke “irreducible complexity” as an excuse for ignoring the role of natural selection.  That is not a reasonable thing to do, to put it kindly.  I was thinking about this while reading this post over at Uncommon Descent.  Jonathan M. writes:  A couple months ago, I took an online “moodle” class with the Center for Inquiry on the topic of the evolution debate. The instructor was the renowned philosopher and evolutionary biologist, Massimo Pigliucci. I entered into an exchange of dialogue with Pigliucci and the other students on the evidence for the efficacy of naturalistic evolution, as well as presenting some counter-arguments against it and for ID.  During the course of our discussion, Pigliucci made some claims which astonished me — especially as arguments coming from a trained philosopher and world-renowned evolutionary theorist. To my surprise, when I articulated the numerous probabilistic hurdles — hurdles which are so pervasive at every level — which Darwinism has to overcome in order to be considered a viable paradigm, he wrote,  No evolutionary biologist I know…actually attaches probabilities to specific evolutionary events of the type you are talking about. There is no way to do that. Similarly, there is no way to attach probabilities to the set of physical laws regulating our universe, for the simple reason that we have no sample population to draw from (which is why typically you estimate probabilities).   Let’s pause here.  One suspects that the key phrase in Pigliucici’s statement is, “of the sort you are talking about.”  Assuming that Jonathan M.’s vague reference to the probabilistic hurdles facing evolution involves the sorts of things ID folks usually say, then Pigliucci’s statement is exactly right.  When an ID proponent starts applying probability language to questions regarding the fine-tuning of the universe or to specific biological structures, it’s a pretty safe bet they are talking through their hats.  But Jonathan M. demurs.  He continues:  This struck me at the time as a very strange argument to be making given the fact that many Darwinists (Dawkins & Futuyma spring to mind) say that the brilliance of Darwin was to reduce the improbability of getting complex, design-like systems. What was the whole point of “Climbing Mount Improbable”? The point was that probability didn’t have to jump up the sheer face of the cliff. It could meander up the gently sloping rear side, in small probability increments. But if we can’t assign probabilities to the events, exactly what has Darwin’s theory done?  The image of probability jumping up the sheer face of a cliff is amusing, but otherwise I fail to understand how any of this relates to what Pigliucci said.  After all, he certainly did not say that you must never, ever use probability language in the context of evolution.  In context, it is perfectly clear what Dawkins and Futuyma have in mind.  If we naively think of every possible genotype having the same probability as every other possible genotype, and then imagine evolution proceeding by selecting genotypes entirely at random, then the probability is vanishingly small that we shall ever find one that produces a functional, complex organism.  But when we factor natural selection into the process it becomes clear that we should not be treating all possible genotypes as equiprobable.  Instead, most of those genotypes have a probability close to zero of ever occurring, because they will be weeded out by selection.  The handful of functional genotypes will be favored by selection.  In this way it is meaningful to say that natural selection changes the probabilities of evolving various structures.  Notice, though, that neither Dawkins nor Futuyma tried to calculate a precise number representing the probability of evolving some particular complex system.  That’s precisely the sort of calculation Pigliucci was describing as impossible.  Jonathan M. now writes:  In response to Massimo, I cited several attempts by Darwinists — many of which feature in the peer-reviewed literature — which attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of the Darwinian mechanism by virtue of probabilistic arguments. I wrote…  He now unloads a long list of examples in which evolutionists employ probabilistic arguments.  Follow the link to the post for the details. He concludes his list with:  But this should be sufficient to refute your [Pigliucci’s] claim that evolutionary biologists are not interested in evaluating probabilistic feasibility.  He now protests that he never got a reply from Pigliucci.  I’m not surprised, since Jonathan M. is completely confused about what the issue is.  Pigliucci certainly never claimed that biologists are not interested in evaluating probabilistic feasibility (whatever that even means).  He said simply that evolutionary biologists do not assign probabilities to specific events in the way that ID folks would like.  For example, Jonathan M. points to a calculation in which biologist Sean Carroll estimated the probability of obtaining the same mutation four times independently in different orders of birds.  In such a narrowly defined situation the problem has more to do with combinatorics than probability, and we can be confident that all of the relevant variables can be approximated with reasonable accuracy.  He also points to a paper by Durrett and Schmidt , in which they evaluated the probability of obtaining two particular mutations in at least one individual of a population.  Once again, in such a narrowly defined situation it is possible to get a grip on all of the relevant variables.  But notice that neither they, nor Carroll, were trying to calculate the probability of evolving a flagellum or anything remotely like that.  In the remaining examples the authors don’t explicitly calculate the probability of anything.  Jonathan M. mentions Dawkins’ “weasel” experiment , presented in his book The Blind Watchmaker. But Dawkins was merely illustrating the power of cumulative selection versus random selection.  He was not calculating probabilities. This paper by Wilf and Ewens , also mentioned in the post, puts some mathematical meat on the bones of Dawkins’ suggestion.  They are working with probabilities only indirectly, and certainly were not trying to assign precise numerical values to specific evolutionary events.  The final reference is to the Avida simulation , but this too had nothing to do with working out the probabilities of specific evolutionary events.  The basic point here is very simple.  A proper probability calculation begins with the definition of a probability space, which means roughly that you must have a grasp on all of the things that might happen and also on the probabilities with which those events occur.  There are many contexts in evolutionary biology where that can be done.  In population genetics, for example, we typically narrow our focus to small numbers of loci over short periods of time, which permits us to get a grip on all of the relevant variables.  This is far different from trying to work out precise probabilities for specific structures that evolved over vast stretches of time.  In such situations we have no hope of getting a grip on everything.  But ID folks forge ahead regardless.  More precisely, since they almost never carry out actual calculations, they simply claim that such things can be done and that when they are the result is bad news for evolution.  Pointing out that this sort of thing is not feasible even in principle, as PIgliucci quite sensibly did, hardly implies that probability does not have useful roles to play in evolutionary theory.

It is such a naked display of ignorance.          #2  Kel   August 16, 2011    Oh good, it’s not just me who finds such arguments as grossly misrepresenting the process. I remember being asked to calculate the probability of some existing gene, as if I had a complete evolutionary history by which to crunch the numbers. Geting so sick of seeing the sharpshooter fallacy expressed as ‘proof’ a designer must have done it.          #3  Massimo Pigliucci   August 16, 2011    Yup, you got it exactly right!          #4  wbk   August 16, 2011    If you calculated the probability of the particular arrangement of grains of sand on the beach at a snapshot in time it would be wildly improbable, and yet there it is (and you get a new wildly improbable arrangement after each wave recedes). Mis-interpreting this kind of small probability is very common. We’re encouraged to interpret small probabilities as evidence that an event is unlikely to occur in some contexts, such as the small probability of a chance match in a DNA test in a criminal case. It’s not so straightforward to recognize the difference between how probability is used in a criminal case and how it’s used here. The key, I think, is that small probabilities are really only meaningful when they’re compared with other alternative outcomes (e.g. the probability of a chance match in a criminal case, vs. the probability of a match if the sample came from the accused).          #5  Mike Gage   August 17, 2011    Has anyone else ever tried to comment at Uncommon Descent? I made some very tame comments just pointing out some simple errors in reasoning and they were never posted. Apparently that is their M.O. They censor all other opinions (except for a few very mild cases so they can deny it) and just have a safe community free of well-argued dissent.          #6  Owlmirror   August 17, 2011    Monsieur Rosenhouse, $$ \frac{(a+b^n)}{n} = x $$, therefore, God exists!  Reply!          #7  James Thompson   August 17, 2011    Do you think that the arguments would be more accessible and clear if they focused on relative probability (or likelihood ratios?) rather than absolute probability? Evolution is complex, and there are many factors that are difficult to estimate. However, if one is clever about the way that comparisons are made, many of those factors will cancel out.          #8  Koray   August 17, 2011    No surprise there, Jason. You wrote a book on how people fail to grok probability theory after all.          #9  craig schwartz   August 17, 2011    Given the typical human ejaculate contains some hundred of millions of sperm, and give the number of chance meetings and couplings of JonathanMs’ parents, and grandparents, and along the whole chain of his ancestry, the probability of JonathanM existing at all is vanishingly small. Therefore, he doesn’t (exist).          #10  Bob O'H   August 17, 2011    I’m not going to bother to set craig schwartz straight because (a) by the same argument he doesn’t exist either, and (b) I don’t exist.  The Lord, however, does exist – or so it seems to me. Perhaps you’d like to sing to him. He likes that. Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.          #11  Richard Wein   August 17, 2011    To calculate a probability (or any other quantity relating to a real process) we need to be able to abstract the real, complex process down to a relatively simple model which roughly preserves the quantity that we’re interested in. This isn’t always possible.  Nilsson and Pelger did it (arguably) for the evolution of an eye, by abstracting the eye down to its most significant elements, and using a crude general model for estimating the time needed for each small change. (They estimated an expected time rather than a probability, but the two are closely related.) But note that they were showing the existence of an evolutionary scenario that rendered the evolution of that trait probable. It would be much harder to show the non-existence of any such scenario, which is what the creationist is trying to do.          #12  JimR   August 17, 2011    Given that evolution consists of small incremental changes, then trying to apply probability as if each event is independent gives you the (1/quazillion)^wayupthere kind of calculations. This model is completely wrong. Bayes theorem is the only accurate model basis where each step is preconditioned on the prior one. With simultaneous combinations in the 10^? occurring and infeasible ones dropping out, the calculation at each step is 10^?/quazillion), a much lower, but still unknown probability. Also there is not just one selection, but multiple surviving, all of which may be equally feasible. AND most likely there are many replicates of each of the multiple lines. Catastrophic events may weed some of these lines. The many lines and many reps is especially true in the evolutionary changes in unicellular organisms. It becomes somewhat narrower as the complexity of the organism advances. So the timeline for advantageous changes in the unicellular evolution is short compared to the timeline for more complex lines. Yet the time existed. I’m sorry for folks that cannot imagine these vast populations changing over time. There is no end goal except survival at each step. Natural Selection is a scary, but fascinating process. I’m glad I made it to see the advances made up to now. I wonder where life forms will be 10^n years from now.          #13  TomS   August 17, 2011    I like to calculate, using the same methodology, the probability that an intelligent designer would design things the way they are.  An intelligent designer, presumably, can do more things than can be done by “naturalistic processes”.  The probability that something happens is the number of favorable cases divided by the number of possible cases. Intelligent design means that the denominator, the number of possible cases, is greater than the number of possible cases with naturalistic processes.  This means that, no matter how small the probability is that naturalistic processes would result in such-and-such, the probability is smaller that an intelligent designer would do it.  Things would change, to be sure, if someone would specify what sorts of things intelligent designers would not, or could not, do.          #14  Dunc   August 17, 2011    To take a slightly different tack, there’s also the question of whether a combination with an apparently vanishingly low probability actually [i]is[/i] all that improbable once you’re dealing with a beaker the size of a planet over timescales of hundreds of millions of years… Sure, the question is fundamentally “not even wrong”, but even granting these absurd premises for the sake of argument, I’m still not convinced.          #15  NJ   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H @ 10:  I’m not going to bother to set craig schwartz straight because (a) by the same argument he doesn’t exist either, and (b) I don’t exist.  That whooshing sound you heard was the point of his post going right by you.          #16  Tommy Holland   August 17, 2011    Reminds me of the absurd probability calculations that evangelists make to demonstrate how unlikely it would be for a man named Jesus to fulfill an Old Testament prophecy, let alone “hundreds” of them.  They’re careful to list the absurdly large numbers, but never show how those numbers were calculated.          #17  Lenoxus   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H:  The Lord, however, does exist – or so it seems to me. Perhaps you’d like to sing to him. He likes that. Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  That’s an… oddly constrained description. Is “the Lord” the name of one of your pets, unable to literally say “that pleases me” but able to wag its tail or rub its face against you?  Or perhaps you are being extremely euphemistic, and “the Lord” is your nickname for a lover? Nothing wrong with that, of course. It’s just that I can’t help but see “if you get my drift” after “he acts in a way I interpret to mean he likes it”.  If “the Lord” is God, I wonder why his tastes have changed. Didn’t the smell of burning ox flesh used to please his nostrils? But now he’s all about the music. An improvent, I suppose.          #18  TomS   August 17, 2011    @craig schwartz #9:  I like that version of the probability argument, too.  The way I prefer to calculate it is:  First of all, excluding intermarriage, a person has 2 parents, 4 grandparents, and 8 grandparents, so let’s assume distinct 10 ancestors per generation in the 19th century and earlier; and three generations per century. That means 30 ancestors per century. If we go back 1000 years, that means about 300 ancestors.  And in those days, a lot of children died before reaching maturity, something like 50%. (We can reduce that number significantly by considering the probability that ancestor X and ancestor Y met and became the parents of your ancestor Z.)  So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^900 = 1 / 10^900.          #19  dean   August 17, 2011    “the Heritage Foundation (an ultra-right-wing political think tank) ”  It’s not a think tank: it’s a dogma tank.          #20  eric   August 17, 2011    there’s also the question of whether a combination with an apparently vanishingly low probability actually [i]is[/i] all that improbable  Right.  As several posters have pointed out, highly improbable things happen all the time.  In fact, in any circumstance where a large number of different things could happen, there is a near-100% chance that something highly improbable will happen. 🙂  Have a creo tell you what limit makes some event too improbable to happen (i.e., 1 in 10^X).  Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to 1.3*X (rounding up), and you’ll create an event that is less probable than their limit.          #21  Raging Bee   August 17, 2011    IF you want to disprove evolution using probability, you have to demonstrate that the creation of all life on Earth as we see it by a “Designer” is MORE probable than the creation of such life through evolution.  So how would we do that?  First, of course, we have to make some assumptions about the Designer: who/what is he/she/it/they?  And since the overwhelming majority of creationists clearly assume it’s the God of the Bible, we’ll go with that assumption: Go — excuse me, The Designer — is a supernatural being of literally infinite power and knowledge.  Next step: what is the range of possible universes this esigner can create?  Answer: an INFINITE range — an all-powerful Go — Designer — can create anything he’s capable of imagining, which, for a being of infinite intelligence, is an infinite range.  So what’s the probability of the Designer creating this particular Universe, with this particular set of life-forms, out of the literally infinite range of possibile universes he could have created?  Why, that would be one in infinity — which is to say zero.  Not “essentially zero,” mind you, not “vanishingly small,” not “close” to zero, but really, truly, exactly, LITERALLY zero point zero zero zip zilch nada buggerall fuggedaboutit.  Creationists, please reply.          #22  Dr. I. Needtob Athe   August 17, 2011    When someone argues that evolution is too improbable to be true, one might respond in this fashion:  “Think about the improbability that you were born. It required that your two parents met each other and mated at the exact time that they did (else your brother or sister would have been born instead), and that, in turn, required that your four grandparents met each other and mated at the exact time that they did so that your parents existed in the first place, which required that your eight great-grandparents all met and mated at the exact time that they did, and so on, all the way back to the beginning of mankind. Therefore, using your logic, I just proved that you don’t exist.”          #23  Vicki   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H: I trust there’s enough fish to keep the Lord happy. (Lenoxus: It’s a literary allusion.)  This is the point at which I want to tell the anti-evolutionists that the probability of humans having evolved is 1, because it has happened in every known universe. I don’t believe this, or rather I don’t think it’s meaningful, but I also think it’s sounder than their numbers, because it’s based on observed facts, namely, we exist.          #24  TomS   August 17, 2011    @Raging Bee #21:  I agree fully with you. I was being a little more conservative, but I agree that the probability that an omnipotent being would create such-and-such is zero .  But I would note that mathematicians do not equate “probability zero” to “impossible”. For example, a real number is rational with probability zero.  BTW, I made a mistake in the final calculations of my post #18. It should read:  So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^90 = 1 / 10^90.          #25  Jeff Sherry   August 17, 2011    Owlmirror, wasn’t that argument used in Catherine the Greats court to dismiss a french philosopher?          #26  Ken sinisi   August 17, 2011    Doesn’t the seemingly endless debate of evolution vs. creationism, when broken down to it’s simplest form, become a debate of the logical vs. the illogical? Why would one continually try to explain and reason with another who insists that a wheel is square, and not round? Prove to me that the wheel is round. I say it’s square. A lesson in futility.          #27  stevev   August 17, 2011    So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^900 = 1 / 10^900.  But all of your ancestors DID survive to maturity (or you wouldn’t be here) so the probability is 1.          #28  Kel   August 17, 2011    Plantinga’s EAAN is a perfect example of armchair philosophy, where really such an approach shows moore the limitation of the philosopher than of the process itself. Fodor’s a priori argument against natural selection another. It’s interesting reading about experiment after experiment that illustrates natural selection so well, only to find talking about counterfactuals that rule out ‘selection for’. In defence of philosophers, many rushed to point out precisely where Fodor was mistaken, just as many have argued against Plantinga. But what good does either argument do for the practice of biology? Does either argument make predictions about the phenomena observed? Are they empirically falsifiable? If not, what good are they?          #29  Jud   August 17, 2011    Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  Dude, He’s gonna kill you.  Kinda screws up your “argument” (fond hope, really).          #30  Kel   August 17, 2011    Whoops, that last comment was meant to go in a different thread. My mistake.          #31  Jud   August 17, 2011    Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  Dude, He’s gonna kill you.  Kinda screws up your “argument” (fond hope, really).          #32  Jud   August 17, 2011    One typical creationist error is to consider the actual outcome as the only “right” outcome, and treat one over number-of-possible-outcomes as the relevant probability.  This is what’s behind the argument that the probability you exist is infinitesimal, or the grains-of-sand example in #4.  Sean B. Carroll pointed out in one of his books that if the creationist view were correct, no one would win the (Powerball) lottery for a couple million years – the odds of a particular player winning are about 200 million to 1, and there are two drawings per week, so about 100 per year.  But someone wins the lottery every couple of weeks, so that’s obviously not the correct calculation.  The correct calculation is the one that gives the odds of *anyone* winning the lottery, just as the correct evolutionary calculation is not the odds of one specific mutation, but of *any* mutation occurring that allows the organism to survive and reproduce.  (Those odds are then of course modified by selection in some cases, and go to fixation through genetic drift in other cases.)          #33  Matt G   August 17, 2011    I came up with an analogy.  Imagine playing bridge and having all four players dealt all the cards in a suit.  The probability of being dealt those hands is minuscule, yet the probability of being dealt ANY given set of hands is just as minuscule.          #34  Face   August 18, 2011    denemek lazım kanka denemekden zarar gelmez          #35  Face   August 18, 2011    reis diyosa haklıdır          #36  Kel   August 18, 2011    Matt G, the problem with that analogy is that the creationists will agree that each hand is equally improbable – but that you’ve gotten a royal flush. While any hand is equally improbable, the quality of the hand varies in probability.  That said, they leave the most crucial element out – selection. If you return individual cards and keep good ones, gradually you’ll get a better and better hand. Yes, a royal flush is really improbable, but you’re going to get one so much quicker by gradually mutating a hand than you are doing it from scratch. By assigning those a priori improbabilities, they misrepresent the process, and thus the numbers are useless.          #37  Remo   August 18, 2011    If the universe is infinite (which it may well be) then regardless of its improbability, life will have arisen in an infinite number of locations.  QED          #38  Owlmirror   August 18, 2011    Owlmirror, wasn’t that argument used in Catherine the Greats court to dismiss a french philosopher?  Actually, it is almost certainly apocryphal .  But I am sure that Jason knows of the anecdote, and, I hope, finds the reference appropriately amusing.          #39  TomS   August 18, 2011    As far as the “Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism”, I like to transpose all of the arguments by the evolution-deniers into arguments where “evolution” is replaced by “reproduction”. It’s fascinating just how many of the arguments for creationism/intelligent design turn out to be at least as good (if not better!) arguments for Scientific Storkism.  For example, let us suppose that our brains are the product of naturalistic processes of reproduction and development. How, then, can we trust out thoughts?  BTW, let us suppose that our thoughts are, rather, just implanted in our brains by some “intelligent designer”. Does that make them any more reliable? After all, this is the same “intelligent designer” who designed the universe with the false appearance of life being related by billions of years of common descent. Would you trust a used-car salesman who told you that the used car only had the appearance of being 20 years old with 500,000 miles on it – it’s “really” last year’s model? (And the used-car salesman is only off by a factor of 10 or 100 – not a factor of a million or so, like “young earth creationism”.)          #40  anthrosciguy   August 18, 2011    One problem pseudoscientists face is that they shortcut from speculation to the end.  While it’s possible that a biologist thinking about evolution (it would have to be sometime back when we didn’t have anywhere near as much info as we do now) might make a probalistic back of the envelope calculation to see if a completely random process — random from start to finish — could account for what we see in nature.  They’d see that it doesn’t, and the reaction would be that they needed to do more thinking about what could account for this.  And they did that and we’ve got a very sound idea of how this happens.  The pseudoscientist typically takes the first speculation and that’s it: they treat it as the finished product and it becomes, in their minds, data.  You see this sort of short circuiting from speculation to “data” over and over in virtually all types of pseudoscience and pseudohistory.          #41  Matt G   August 18, 2011    Kel-  I use that bridge analogy to counter the “evolution is like a tornado going through a junkyard and assembling a 747” argument.  Any number of organisms COULD have evolved, but a tiny subset actually did.  You extension of my analogy is a lot like Dawkin’s “Methinks it is like a weasel” analogy which illustrates how cycles of (random) mutation and (non-random) selection can generate something non-random.          #42  Kel   August 18, 2011    Matt G, indeed. It’s a really good analogy, so much so that creationists still try their damn hardest to miss the point and take the analogy for what it wasn’t. Though it’s even more amazing that creationists so fundamentally misunderstand how evolution works that any talk of probability that they’re going to take any explanation of improbability as being monkeys on typewriters producing Shakespeare.          #43  Pragmatist   August 18, 2011    All of these type of Creationist arguments really are variations on this question: “It works in practice, but can they prove it works in theory?” The absurdity of that is all that is needed to rebut them.          #44  shekhar   August 19, 2011    It is very wonderfull center          #45  John K.   August 19, 2011    Probability is just a way to manage the unknown.  The big problem in  the probability argument here is taking known factors and treating them as if they were unknown.  A set of parents have 3 daughters.  What are the chances the next child they have will be female?  1 in 2 of course.  Why not 1 in 16?  Because the first 3 children have KNOWN genders.  Lottery numbers are difficult to pick because of the many unknown factors.  If the trajectories of all the balls are accurately traced (a difficult task to be sure) the correct numbers could be picked every time.  When something happens that is “highly improbable” to you, it is more a reflection how much of the process was unknown to you.  For creationists that deliberately refuse to consider evidence, it is natural that they think the probability is very low.  Their understanding is abysmally poor.          #46  Lenoxus   August 20, 2011    Regarding the EAN: on top of everything else, it seems that the EAN requires a premise like “It is true that our minds are rational and our thinking process can be trusted to be accurate.” For a premise in a logical argument, sn’t that extremely problematic? How do we know that our minds aren’t faulty?  In fact, it’s worse than that, because we know, from thousands of experiments, the precise ways our minds get fooled; we call them “cognitive biases”. So we actually have positive evidence that if our minds are the product of an omnipotent designer, she wanted them to be irrational.          #47  rob   August 23, 2011    @Remo:  “It is known that there are an infinte number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely products of a deranged imagination.”          #48  Jeff   August 28, 2011    He just shrugged and went on to the next question.  This is what they do. A couple of years ago, I attended a talk given by a YEC who had just bamboozled Harvard into giving him a PhD in Cell Biology. It was sponsored by an evangelical church, but there were a number of scientists and science-oriented people in attendance, including a real microbiologist, and they hammered away at him during the Q&A. Each time he was backed into a corner, made to admit he didn’t understand or was ignorant of the science, he just dropped the issue in question and moved on.  For these people, it has absolutely nothing to do with apprehending objective reality. It’s entirely about getting the ontological security blanket for the few brief decades they’re here – and for many (I contend it’s most), fantasizing about our eternal torment being their half-time entertainment in the afterlife.          #49  Tomato Addict   September 8, 2011    @#7: Michael Behe’s “Complex Specified Information” is a likelihood ratio (sort of), but it fails for the same reason that Jason wrote about. CSI calculates the likelihood of jumping up the cliff, a “big jump” null hypothesis, and claims it is impossible. The possibility of gradual selection, or going up the gradual slope, is not considered, nor it is acknowledged that it isn’t possible to calculate such a number.          #50  Paul   November 2, 2011    Fantastic post I very much enjoyed it, keep up the good work.          #51  Emil Sugak   November 30, 2011    Throughout history man has taken very good records of big events thats a fact. So to say evolution is true,Then why is it not recorded. I mean man has been around thousands of years and there is not one record of one animal evolving from one to another or one evolving to man. Even if something as far fetched as that happened it would have made headline news, thats also a fact. So if we supposedly evolved from monkeys or apes why then are they still here and why are they not evolving now,Even if they were scientists would be recording it and that would also make headline news, also a fact.So now scientists are again trying to assume that evolution happens rapidly,Even you should be able to laugh yourself silly on that one. For everything that happens there is proof,another fact and you know that also. Bottom line is all science is trying to assume that evolution is true when in fact it is not and not even close to being true. All that happens all around the world is everything all living things great and small adapt to the environment they are living in. When all evolution theories are proven wrong so far I cannot wait to hear what the next assumption will be, Should be a good one.          #52  Wow   November 30, 2011    > So to say evolution is true,Then why is it not recorded.  It is.  The evolution of viral resistance is a record of evolution, for example.  > and there is not one record of one animal evolving from one to another  See above.  > or one evolving to man  It isn’t magic. No “Size of an Elephant!” fwoosh.  You’re still beholden to the childish wish fulfilment.  Have a look at the foetus development. There’s a tadpole. There’s a lizard. Then there’s a baby. Then there’s a child. Then there’s an adult.  Those changes are so much part of every day, that transformation from tadpole to human doesn’t make the news because it is so commonplace.  > So now scientists are again trying to assume that evolution happens rapidly  You’re proof that devolution happens rapidly.  I guess you just invest whatever nonsense you believe is nonsense and paste it over what you’re told about science so you don’t have to think. How rapid is “rapid” in this case?  > Bottom line is all science is trying to assume that evolution is true when in fact it is not and not even close to being true  Bottom line: what is going on, then?          #53  Eric   March 15, 2012    The probability argument is just one. Evolutionists also have to bear the burden of explaining how naturalistic processes somehow broke some very basic laws of nature in order for life to be created, i.e. the law of biogenesis and the laws of thermodynamics. I find it funny that a group that is so set on evidence being the only criteria for rational belief in something would be quite content with, “We don’t know.”, regarding the theory of evolution.          #54  Wow   March 15, 2012    “i.e. the law of biogenesis and the laws of thermodynamics”  Nope, biogenesis doesn’t disobey the laws of thermodynamics.  They turn high-energy, low-entropy sunlight at a spectrum of 6000K and turn it into low-energy, high-entropy thermal energy at a spectrum of ~300K.  Nothing broken there.  I find it funny when people find it funny when they promote their ignorance of science onto others and think it proves these others are wrong.       New comments have been disabled.

Chromosomes are microscopically small,  rod-shaped structures which carry the genes. Within the chromosomes is an even  smaller structure called DNA. This is one of the most important chemical  substances in the human body -- or in any other living thing. Increasing scientific understanding of DNA  molecules has revealed enormous problems for materialism.    DNA is a super-molecule which stores coded hereditary  information. It consists of two long "chains" of chemical "building blocks"  paired together. In humans, the strands of DNA are almost 2 yards long, yet less  than a trillionth of an inch thick.    In function, DNA is somewhat like a computer program on a  floppy disk. It stores and transfers encoded information and instructions. It is  said that the DNA of a human stores enough information code to fill 1,000 books -- each with 500 pages of very small, closely-printed type. The DNA code  produces a product far more sophisticated than that of any computer. Amazingly,  this enormous set of instructions fits with ease within a single cell and  routinely directs the formation of entire adult humans, starting with just a  single fertilized egg. Even the DNA of a bacterium is highly complex, containing  at least 3 million units, all aligned in a very precise, meaningful  sequence.    DNA and the molecules that surround it form a truly superb  mechanism -- a miniaturized marvel. the information is so compactly stored that  the amount of DNA necessary to code all the people living on our planet might  fit into a space no larger than an asprin tablet!    Many scientists are convinced that cells containing such a  complex code and such intricate chemistry could never have come into being by  pure, undirected chemistry. No matter how chemicals are mixed, they do not create DNA spirals or any intelligent code whatsoever. Only DNA reproduces DNA.    Two well known scientists calculated the odds of life forming  by natural processes. They estimated that there is less than 1 chance in 10 to  the 40,000power that life could have originated by random trials. 10 to the  40,000power is a 1 with 40,000 zeros after it!    - "...life cannot have had a random beginning...The trouble is  that there are about two thousand enzymes, and the chance of obtaining them all  in a random trial is only one part in 10 to the 40,000power, an outrageously  small probability that could not be faced even if the whole universe consisted  of organic soup. If one is not prejudiced either by social beliefs or by a  scientific training into the conviction that life originated on the Earth, this simple calculation  wipes the idea entirely out of court....The enormous information content of even  the simplest living systems...cannot in our view be generated by what are often  called "natural" processes...For life to have originated on the Earth it would  be necessary that quite explicit instruction should have been provided for its  assembly...There is no way in which we can expect to avoid the need for  information, no way in which we can simply get by with a bigger and better  organic soup, as we ourselves hoped might be possible a year or two ago."    Fred Hoyle and N. Chandra Wickramasinghe,  Evolution from  Space [Aldine House, 33 Welbeck Street ,  London W1M 8LX:  J.M. Dent & Sons, 1981), p. 148, 24,150,30,31).    How can one gain some conception of the size of such a huge  number? According to most Evolutionists, the universe is less than 30 billion  years old -- and there are fewer than 10 to the 18th Power seconds in 30 billion  years. So, even if nature could somehow have produced trillions of genetic code  combinations every second for 30 billion years, the probabilities against  producing the simplest one-celled animal by trial and error would still be  inconceivably immense! In other words, probabilities greatly favor those that  believe an intelligent designer was responsible for originating even the  simplest DNA molecules.    Chemist Dr. Grebe: "That organic evolution could account for  the complex forms of life in the past and the present has long since been  abandoned by men who grasp the importance of the DNA genetic code."    Researcher and mathematician I.L Cohen: "At that moment, when  the DNA/RNA system became understood, the debate between Evolutionists and  Creationists should have come to a screeching halt...the implications of the  DNA/RNA were obvious and clear....Mathematically speaking, based on probability  concepts, there is no possibility that Evolution vs the mechanism that created  the approximately 6,000,000 species of plants and animals we recognize  today."    Evolutionist Michael Denton: "The complexity of the simplest  known type of cell is so great that it is impossible to accept that such an  object could have been thrown together suddenly by some kind of freakish, vastly  improbable, event. Such an occurrence would be indistinguishable from a  miracle."    Famed researcher Sir Fred Hoyle is in agreement with  Creationists on this point. He has reportedly said that supposing the first cell  originated by chance is like believing "a tornado sweeping through a junk yard  might assemble a Boeng 747 from the materials therein."    Many, if not most, origin-of-life researchers now agree with  Hoyle: Life could not have originated by chance or by any known natural  processes. many Evolutionists are now searching for some theoretical force  within matter which might push matter toward the assembly of greater complexity.  Most Creationists believe this is doomed to failure, since it contradicts the  2nd Law of Thermodynamics.    It is important to note that the information written on DNA  molecules is not produced by any known natural interaction of matter. Matter and  molecules have no innate intelligence, allowing self organization into codes.  There are no know n physical laws which give molecules a natural tendency to  arrange themselves into such coded structures.    Like a computer disk, DNA has no intelligence. The complex,  purposeful codes of this "master program" could have only originated outside  itself. In the case of a computer program, the original codes were put there by  an intelligent being, a programmer. Likewise, for DNA, it seems clear that  intelligence must have come first, before the existence of DNA. Statistically,  the odds are enormously in favor of that theory. DNA bears the marks of  intelligent manufacture.    Dr Wilder-Smith is an honored scientist who is certainly  well-informed on modern biology and biochemistry. What is his considered opinion  as to the source of the DNA codes found in each wondrous plant and animal?  "...an attempt to explain the formation of the genetic code from the chemical  components of DNA...is comparable to the assumption that the text of a book  originates from the paper molecules on which the sentences appear, and not from  any external source of information." " As a scientist, I am convinced that the  pure chemistry of a cell is not enough to explain the workings of a cell,  although the workings are chemical. The chemical workings of the cell are  controlled by information which does not reside in the atoms and molecules of  that cell. There is an author which transcends the material and the matter of  which these strands are made. The author first of all conceived the information  necessary to make a cell, then wrote it down, and then fixed it in a mechanism  of reading it and realizing it in practice -- so that the cell builds itself  from the information..."    One need only look carefully at any living creature to gain  some concept of their enormous complexity. If you have a pet, consider the  complexities that must be involved -- enabling that "package of matter" to move  about, play, remember, show signs of affection, eat, and reproduce!    If that is not enough to boggle your mind, imagine being given  the task of constructing a similar living pet from carbon, calcium, hydrogen,  oxygen, etc. -- the animal's basic constituent parts.    If you have ever held a beloved pet in your hands, completely  limp and dead, you may have some comprehension of the helplessness of even the  most intelligent and sophisticated scientist when it comes to the overwhelming  problem of trying to create life.    In contrast, the natural world does not have the advantages  people bring to the problem. In nature, there are only matter, energy, time,  chance and the physical laws -- no guiding force, no purpose, and no goal.    Yet, even with all of modern man's accumulated knowledge,  advanced tools, and experience, we are still absolutely overwhelmed at the  complexities. This is despite the fact that we are certainly not starting from  absolute zero in this problem, for there are millions of actual living examples  of life to scrutinize.    THE INCREDIBLE COMPLEXITY OF MAN    All living things are extremely complex, even the tiniest  single-celled animals and bacteria. However, none surpasses the overall  complexity of the human being. Not only is each person constructed of trillions  of molecules and cells, but the human brain alone is filled with billions of  cells forming trillions of trillions of connections. The design of the human  brain is truly awesome and beyond our understanding. Every cubic inch of the  human brain contains at least 100 million nerve cells interconnected by 10  thousand miles of fibers.    It has been said that man's 3 pound brain is the most complex  and orderly arrangement of matter in the entire universe! Far more complicated  than any computer, the human brain is capable of storing and creatively  manipulating seemingly infinite amounts of information. Its capabilities and  potential stagger the imagination. The more we use it, the better it  becomes.    The brain capabilities of even the smallest insects are  mind-boggling. The tiny speck of a brain found in a little ant, butterfly or bee  enable them not only to see, smell, taste and move, but even to fly with great  precision. Butterflies routinely navigate enormous distances. Bees and ants  carry on complex social organizations, building projects, and communications.  These miniature brains put our computers and avionics to shame, in  comparison.    The marvels of the bodies of both animals and man are evidently  endless. Dr. A.E. Wilder-Smith makes this thought-provoking and humbling  statement:    "When one considers that the entire chemical information to  construct a man, elephant, frog or an orchid was compressed into two minuscule  reproductive cells (sperm and egg nuclei), one can only be astounded. In  addition to this, all the information is available on the genes to repair the  body (not only to construct it) when it is injured. If one were to request an  engineer to accomplish this feat of information miniaturization, one would be  considered fit for the psychiatric clinic."    It is certainly true that a machine carefully made by a  craftsman reflects the existence of it's creator. It would be foolish to suggest  that time and chance could make a typewriter or a microwave oven, or that the  individual parts could form themselves into these complex mechanisms due to the  physical properties of matter. Yet, life is far, far more complex than any  man-made machine.    The more scientists study life, the more they become deeply  impressed. Nature is full of intricate design and beauty. In contrast to  man-made objects, which look increasingly crude in finish and detail the closer  they are viewed (i.e., through powerful microscopes), the closer life is  examined the more complex and wondrous it appears.    Planet Earth is filled with myriad forms of life, each with  enormous levels of complexity. Materialists believe life in all its amazing  forms consist merely of atoms and molecules. They believe these atoms and  molecules formed themselves into millions of intricate animals and plants. This  view was born out of an earlier, more naive period in science when the extreme  complexity of living systems was not understood. Even if nature could build the  necessary proteins and enzymes, it is far from producing life. There is an  enormous difference between producing a building block and producing a fully  operating and serviced 100-story skyscraper from those building blocks.  Buildings require builders; programs require programmers.    Today, most scientists are convinced that life could never have  come into being without some form of highly intelligent and powerful  designer.    THE BOTTOM LINE on the origin of life    - During all recorded human history, there has never been a  substantiated case of a living thing being produced from anything other than  another living thing.    - As yet, evolutionism has not produced a scientifically  credible explanation for the origin of such immense complexities as DNA, the  human brain, and many elements of the cosmos.    - It is highly premature for materialists to claim that all  living things evolved into existence, when science has yet to discover how even  one protein molecule could actually have come into existence by natural  processes.    - there is no scientific proof that life did (or ever could)  evolve into existence from non-living matter. Further, there is substantial  evidence that spontaneous generation is impossible. Only DNA is known to produce  DNA. No chemical interaction of molecules has even come close to producing this  ultra-complex code which is so essential to all known life.    However what do your scientific minds have to say about the above?          1             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Moontanman    2019            Moontanman    2019    SuperNerd       Senior Members    2019   10255 posts   Location:  South Eastern North Carolina              Posted July 22, 2012         http://crl.i8.com/Evolution/Dna.html        DNA Molecules and the Odds Against Evolution  Within each cell there is an area called the nucleus which  contains the all-important chromosomes. Chromosomes are microscopically small,  rod-shaped structures which carry the genes. Within the chromosomes is an even  smaller structure called DNA. This is one of the most important chemical  substances in the human body -- or in any other living thing. Increasing scientific understanding of DNA  molecules has revealed enormous problems for materialism.    DNA is a super-molecule which stores coded hereditary  information. It consists of two long "chains" of chemical "building blocks"  paired together. In humans, the strands of DNA are almost 2 yards long, yet less  than a trillionth of an inch thick.    In function, DNA is somewhat like a computer program on a  floppy disk. It stores and transfers encoded information and instructions. It is  said that the DNA of a human stores enough information code to fill 1,000 books -- each with 500 pages of very small, closely-printed type. The DNA code  produces a product far more sophisticated than that of any computer. Amazingly,  this enormous set of instructions fits with ease within a single cell and  routinely directs the formation of entire adult humans, starting with just a  single fertilized egg. Even the DNA of a bacterium is highly complex, containing  at least 3 million units, all aligned in a very precise, meaningful  sequence.    DNA and the molecules that surround it form a truly superb  mechanism -- a miniaturized marvel. the information is so compactly stored that  the amount of DNA necessary to code all the people living on our planet might  fit into a space no larger than an asprin tablet!    Many scientists are convinced that cells containing such a  complex code and such intricate chemistry could never have come into being by  pure, undirected chemistry. No matter how chemicals are mixed, they do not create DNA spirals or any intelligent code whatsoever. Only DNA reproduces DNA.    Two well known scientists calculated the odds of life forming  by natural processes. They estimated that there is less than 1 chance in 10 to  the 40,000power that life could have originated by random trials. 10 to the  40,000power is a 1 with 40,000 zeros after it!    - "...life cannot have had a random beginning...The trouble is  that there are about two thousand enzymes, and the chance of obtaining them all  in a random trial is only one part in 10 to the 40,000power, an outrageously  small probability that could not be faced even if the whole universe consisted  of organic soup. If one is not prejudiced either by social beliefs or by a  scientific training into the conviction that life originated on the Earth, this simple calculation  wipes the idea entirely out of court....The enormous information content of even  the simplest living systems...cannot in our view be generated by what are often  called "natural" processes...For life to have originated on the Earth it would  be necessary that quite explicit instruction should have been provided for its  assembly...There is no way in which we can expect to avoid the need for  information, no way in which we can simply get by with a bigger and better  organic soup, as we ourselves hoped might be possible a year or two ago."    Fred Hoyle and N. Chandra Wickramasinghe,  Evolution from  Space [Aldine House, 33 Welbeck Street ,  London W1M 8LX:  J.M. Dent & Sons, 1981), p. 148, 24,150,30,31).    How can one gain some conception of the size of such a huge  number? According to most Evolutionists, the universe is less than 30 billion  years old -- and there are fewer than 10 to the 18th Power seconds in 30 billion  years. So, even if nature could somehow have produced trillions of genetic code  combinations every second for 30 billion years, the probabilities against  producing the simplest one-celled animal by trial and error would still be  inconceivably immense! In other words, probabilities greatly favor those that  believe an intelligent designer was responsible for originating even the  simplest DNA molecules.    Chemist Dr. Grebe: "That organic evolution could account for  the complex forms of life in the past and the present has long since been  abandoned by men who grasp the importance of the DNA genetic code."    Researcher and mathematician I.L Cohen: "At that moment, when  the DNA/RNA system became understood, the debate between Evolutionists and  Creationists should have come to a screeching halt...the implications of the  DNA/RNA were obvious and clear....Mathematically speaking, based on probability  concepts, there is no possibility that Evolution vs the mechanism that created  the approximately 6,000,000 species of plants and animals we recognize  today."    Evolutionist Michael Denton: "The complexity of the simplest  known type of cell is so great that it is impossible to accept that such an  object could have been thrown together suddenly by some kind of freakish, vastly  improbable, event. Such an occurrence would be indistinguishable from a  miracle."    Famed researcher Sir Fred Hoyle is in agreement with  Creationists on this point. He has reportedly said that supposing the first cell  originated by chance is like believing "a tornado sweeping through a junk yard  might assemble a Boeng 747 from the materials therein."    Many, if not most, origin-of-life researchers now agree with  Hoyle: Life could not have originated by chance or by any known natural  processes. many Evolutionists are now searching for some theoretical force  within matter which might push matter toward the assembly of greater complexity.  Most Creationists believe this is doomed to failure, since it contradicts the  2nd Law of Thermodynamics.    It is important to note that the information written on DNA  molecules is not produced by any known natural interaction of matter. Matter and  molecules have no innate intelligence, allowing self organization into codes.  There are no know n physical laws which give molecules a natural tendency to  arrange themselves into such coded structures.    Like a computer disk, DNA has no intelligence. The complex,  purposeful codes of this "master program" could have only originated outside  itself. In the case of a computer program, the original codes were put there by  an intelligent being, a programmer. Likewise, for DNA, it seems clear that  intelligence must have come first, before the existence of DNA. Statistically,  the odds are enormously in favor of that theory. DNA bears the marks of  intelligent manufacture.    Dr Wilder-Smith is an honored scientist who is certainly  well-informed on modern biology and biochemistry. What is his considered opinion  as to the source of the DNA codes found in each wondrous plant and animal?  "...an attempt to explain the formation of the genetic code from the chemical  components of DNA...is comparable to the assumption that the text of a book  originates from the paper molecules on which the sentences appear, and not from  any external source of information." " As a scientist, I am convinced that the  pure chemistry of a cell is not enough to explain the workings of a cell,  although the workings are chemical. The chemical workings of the cell are  controlled by information which does not reside in the atoms and molecules of  that cell. There is an author which transcends the material and the matter of  which these strands are made. The author first of all conceived the information  necessary to make a cell, then wrote it down, and then fixed it in a mechanism  of reading it and realizing it in practice -- so that the cell builds itself  from the information..."    One need only look carefully at any living creature to gain  some concept of their enormous complexity. If you have a pet, consider the  complexities that must be involved -- enabling that "package of matter" to move  about, play, remember, show signs of affection, eat, and reproduce!    If that is not enough to boggle your mind, imagine being given  the task of constructing a similar living pet from carbon, calcium, hydrogen,  oxygen, etc. -- the animal's basic constituent parts.    If you have ever held a beloved pet in your hands, completely  limp and dead, you may have some comprehension of the helplessness of even the  most intelligent and sophisticated scientist when it comes to the overwhelming  problem of trying to create life.    In contrast, the natural world does not have the advantages  people bring to the problem. In nature, there are only matter, energy, time,  chance and the physical laws -- no guiding force, no purpose, and no goal.    Yet, even with all of modern man's accumulated knowledge,  advanced tools, and experience, we are still absolutely overwhelmed at the  complexities. This is despite the fact that we are certainly not starting from  absolute zero in this problem, for there are millions of actual living examples  of life to scrutinize.    THE INCREDIBLE COMPLEXITY OF MAN    All living things are extremely complex, even the tiniest  single-celled animals and bacteria. However, none surpasses the overall  complexity of the human being. Not only is each person constructed of trillions  of molecules and cells, but the human brain alone is filled with billions of  cells forming trillions of trillions of connections. The design of the human  brain is truly awesome and beyond our understanding. Every cubic inch of the  human brain contains at least 100 million nerve cells interconnected by 10  thousand miles of fibers.    It has been said that man's 3 pound brain is the most complex  and orderly arrangement of matter in the entire universe! Far more complicated  than any computer, the human brain is capable of storing and creatively  manipulating seemingly infinite amounts of information. Its capabilities and  potential stagger the imagination. The more we use it, the better it  becomes.    The brain capabilities of even the smallest insects are  mind-boggling. The tiny speck of a brain found in a little ant, butterfly or bee  enable them not only to see, smell, taste and move, but even to fly with great  precision. Butterflies routinely navigate enormous distances. Bees and ants  carry on complex social organizations, building projects, and communications.  These miniature brains put our computers and avionics to shame, in  comparison.    The marvels of the bodies of both animals and man are evidently  endless. Dr. A.E. Wilder-Smith makes this thought-provoking and humbling  statement:    "When one considers that the entire chemical information to  construct a man, elephant, frog or an orchid was compressed into two minuscule  reproductive cells (sperm and egg nuclei), one can only be astounded. In  addition to this, all the information is available on the genes to repair the  body (not only to construct it) when it is injured. If one were to request an  engineer to accomplish this feat of information miniaturization, one would be  considered fit for the psychiatric clinic."    It is certainly true that a machine carefully made by a  craftsman reflects the existence of it's creator. It would be foolish to suggest  that time and chance could make a typewriter or a microwave oven, or that the  individual parts could form themselves into these complex mechanisms due to the  physical properties of matter. Yet, life is far, far more complex than any  man-made machine.    The more scientists study life, the more they become deeply  impressed. Nature is full of intricate design and beauty.

This is evidenced by the fact that so far we haven't found any except here on earth.  I would say we haven't looked and that we don't have many places to look. The only planets in the Sun's habitable zone are Venus, Earth, and Mars. There's a lot more to habitability than merely being in a star's habitable zone. Venus has too thick an atmosphere. Mars, too thin. Neither Venus nor Mars has an active plate tectonics system. Mars might have been habitable long ago, and Mars does show some signs of having borne life long ago. It shows some signs that it still bears life right now. We do see life on the one planet that is habitable, and that life originated very shortly after conditions became hospitable for life. Judging from a sample size of one, maybe two, (which is all we've got), it appears that primitive life is very likely to arise if conditions are right. That said, judging from a small sample size is always an iffy proposition. We need more data.

There is probably no other statement which is a better indication that the arguer doesn't understand evolution. Chance certainly plays a large part in evolution, but this argument completely ignores the fundamental role of natural selection, and selection is the very opposite of chance. Chance, in the form of mutations, provides genetic variation, which is the raw material that natural selection has to work with. From there, natural selection sorts out certain variations. Those variations which give greater reproductive success to their possessors (and chance ensures that such beneficial mutations will be inevitable) are retained, and less successful variations are weeded out. When the environment changes, or when organisms move to a different environment, different variations are selected, leading eventually to different species. Harmful mutations usually die out quickly, so they don't interfere with the process of beneficial mutations accumulating.    Nor is abiogenesis (the origin of the first life) due purely to chance. Atoms and molecules arrange themselves not purely randomly, but according to their chemical properties. In the case of carbon atoms especially, this means complex molecules are sure to form spontaneously, and these complex molecules can influence each other to create even more complex molecules. Once a molecule forms that is approximately self-replicating, natural selection will guide the formation of ever more efficient replicators. The first self-replicating object didn't need to be as complex as a modern cell or even a strand of DNA. Some self-replicating molecules are not really all that complex (as organic molecules go).    Some people still argue that it is wildly improbable for a given self-replicating molecule to form at a given point (although they usually don't state the "givens," but leave them implicit in their calculations). This is true, but there were oceans of molecules working on the problem, and no one knows how many possible self-replicating molecules could have served as the first one. A calculation of the odds of abiogenesis is worthless unless it recognizes the immense range of starting materials that the first replicator might have formed from, the probably innumerable different forms that the first replicator might have taken, and the fact that much of the construction of the replicating molecule would have been non-random to start with.    (One should also note that the theory of evolution doesn't depend on how the first life began. The truth or falsity of any theory of abiogenesis wouldn't affect evolution in the least.)        In short, life does not evolve by chance alone, nor does the theory of evolution have anything to do with how life began.  That's a completely different theory.          3             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Alan McDougall    41            Alan McDougall    41    Quark       Senior Members    41   769 posts   Location:  South Africa Johannesburg/Sunninghill              Posted July 23, 2012  (edited)       The likelihood that you were born faces such vanishingly small odds as to be impossible.

" http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?c1=2&c2=6035753&c3=6035753&c4=http://www.livescience.com/&c5=Technology- News&c6=&c15=C67BD3C1&cv=1.3&cj=1"style="display:none" width="0" height="0"alt="" />          In the wake of controversy over thepossible discovery of arsenic-eating life last week — a finding that couldexpand the bounds of what scientists think life is capable of — a basicquestion perhaps deserves revisiting:        Just what, exactly, is life?    "We don't have a very good  definitionof life ," said researcher Christopher Voigt of the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco, who works on syntheticbiology . "It's a very abstract thing, what we call life, and at whatpoint we say something doesn't have the necessary components versus it does, itjust becomes way too murky."     The question of what constitutes life has dogged scientists since the early days.        Working toward a definition     Aristotle was the first to attempt todefine life, and his proposal boils down to life being something that grows andmaintains itself (he called this "nutrition"), and reproduces.        In 1944, Austrian physicist Erwin  Schrödinger defined life as that which resists decaying to disorder and  equilibrium. This definition relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which  states that closed systems will naturally gain entropy, or disorder, over time.      Essentially, like a teenager's room, without any help from mom, it will  inevitably get messier. But by taking in nutrients and metabolizing them,  living things can work against this trend.        However, this definition would mean that  crystals, which take in energy and create order when they form elaborate  lattices of particles, count as life.        This is the problem with most proposed  definitions of life: They tend of have loopholes.        For example, some have proposed that life  is that which can reproduce itself. However, that definition would exclude  mules, which are born sterile, and would include nonliving things like fire.        Others have suggested that life is  something that can metabolize — that is, take in energy to move or grow, and  release waste — but many nonliving things, like cars, can do that.        "Life, because it is such a complex  system of things with so many interacting parts , each of which is essential, it'sreally tough to make a definition," said biochemist David Deamer of theUniversity of California, Santa Cruz.        Despite the difficulty of pinning down  life, some scientists aren't content to give up, saying a working definition of  life is necessary if we are to identify living things beyond Earth. In that  case, the adage, "You'll know it when you see it" just doesn't cut  it.    S ome Nobel prize winners who believe in some sort of intelligent underpinning reality.

My Reflections on the Intelligent Design Debate    I believe in evolution.  I believe in intelligent design.  I’m not sure what my opinion is of macro-evolution and I’m pretty sure I’m not a young-earther in the traditional sense, but there are certainly others who share my opinion on both of these issues (See peer reviewed article links & the dissent from darwin as well as the article by Stephen Meyer, which is an incredible article).  I believe that textbooks should at least teach the controversy for greater public awareness of the issue.  Does intelligent it belong in a science textbook?  Does intelligent design belong in the science classroom?  I’m not entirely sure.  Perhaps its more of a civics, government, or history issue rather than a science one.  However, it seems that science looses even more if its not included in a scientific context (i.e. they have to re-clarify and re-explain their approach or position on intelligent design at a later date).  The current policy seems to be one of avoidance of conflict and controversy….but thats just an elephant in the room.

The only planets in the Sun's habitable zone are Venus, Earth, and Mars. There's a lot more to habitability than merely being in a star's habitable zone. Venus has too thick an atmosphere. Mars, too thin. Neither Venus nor Mars has an active plate tectonics system. Mars might have been habitable long ago, and Mars does show some signs of having borne life long ago. It shows some signs that it still bears life right now. We do see life on the one planet that is habitable, and that life originated very shortly after conditions became hospitable for life. Judging from a sample size of one, maybe two, (which is all we've got), it appears that primitive life is very likely to arise if conditions are right. That said, judging from a small sample size is always an iffy proposition. We need more data.    I agree your facts, to go further means opinion and even speculation. So here are some of my thoughts (for what they are worth ). It seems to me that once primitive life starts then at some stage we can expect evolution to kick in with a vengeance. Once a life form makes it way forward by intelligence then in evolutionary terms the ability to communicate and record rapidly will soon follow. Under this scenario if life exists throughout the universe it should become intelligent life and there is no reason to think we would be the most advanced or the most inquisitive. In other words some of "them" may have been looking for us for light years and as I understand it we have been looking for signals for a long time without result.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Alan McDougall    41            Alan McDougall    41    Quark       Senior Members    41   769 posts   Location:  South Africa Johannesburg/Sunninghill              Posted July 23, 2012  (edited)       The problem of origin of life is unsolvable by the positivism of science and hence the origin of life should be accepted as an axiom.

(Mark Twain)   I’m reminded of a story about newspaper reporting in the old Soviet
Union (I don’t know if it’s true or not, but it illustrates a point
well). A car race between the United States and the Soviets ended with the
United States car in first, and the Soviet car second (you should also know
only  two cars were in this race). But the reporting in the Soviet Union
stated the Soviet car came in second, while the United States car came in
second to last. Perfectly true, and yet perfectly misleading.  You must be careful with statistics. For example, it’s possible the air in your room right now could
spontaneously all move in the same direction at once, piling up in the
other side of the room leaving you gasping for air. Possible, yes. But
when calculated, the probability is so small as to be reasonably rounded off
to zero (it’s not going to happen, so breathe easy).  A similar argument against evolution applies to the probability of
events occurring which result in new species (mutations, natural
selection  and spontaneous generation). That probability is zero (when rounded
off reasonably). It’s mathematically possible , but the
expectation is so low we logically round it down to zero and state the
event is never going to occur.  So the evolutionist has a problem — the odds of evolution
occurring are zero. One tactic evolutionists attempt to show the
theory isn’t ridiculous (i.e. mathematically impossible) is showing highly
improbable events happen all the time — unfortunately, it’s usually
through a misapplication of statistics. You see, simple logic and
common sense tell you if (as they claim) improbable events happen frequently
one  of two situations is most likely true.   The event really isn’t that improbable. Thus, our mathematical
calculation of statistical odds is incorrect — an error in math has
been made.  Statistics have been misused or misunderstood, similar to our car
race example. The facts and math are correct, but the application of
that knowledge is wrong.   Common sense explains the argument is already wrong, but we can
continue with a specific example and explain exactly why it’s wrong. One of the methods the evolutionist uses draws false
conclusions from a deck of cards — a mistake even a college professor
can make; consider the following discussion from a professor of
mathematics at Temple university.   So if, after the fact, we observe the particular
  evolutionary path actually taken and then calculate the a priori
  probability of its being taken, we will get the minuscule probability that
  creationists mistakenly attach to the process as a whole.
  Here’s another example. We have a deck of cards before us. There are
  almost 10 to the 68 th power – a one with 68 zeroes after it – orderings
  of the 52 cards in the deck. Any of the 52 cards might be first, any of the
  remaining 51 second, any of the remaining 50 third, and so on. This is a
  humongous number, but it’s not hard to devise even everyday situations that
  give rise to much larger numbers.  Now if we shuffle this deck of cards for a long time and then
  examine the particular ordering of the cards that happens to result, we
  would be justified in concluding that the probability of this particular
  ordering of the cards having occurred is approximately 1 chance in 10 to
  the 68th power. This certainly qualifies as minuscule.
  Still, we would not be justified in concluding that the shuffles
  could not have possibly resulted in this particular ordering because its a
  priori probability is so very tiny. Some ordering had to result from the
  shuffling, and this one did . (What’s wrong with Creationist Probability
  — Mathematics Professor John Allen Paulos of Temple University)   Mr. Paulos gets his math right, but the
statistics wrong. The card example comes up repeatedly in attempts to
show evolution isn’t mathematically impossible, but this is the first time
I’ve actually seen a professor of math make the mistake.  His problem lies in the card example. Suppose I have a deck of
cards. He is correct in the 10 68 combinations of cards (the
probability of any 1 combination occurring). But he makes the mistake
of applying statistics. Actually, by shuffling and dealing the cards the
probability is 1 — it’s a certainty one sequence
will occur (one of the 10 68 possibilities). Mr. Paulos does
understand this, as he says “Some ordering had to result from
the shuffling”.  The one in 10 68 is the probability of calling out each
card — in order — as you turn them up. That’s the correct analogy
between  cards and evolution. It’s a certainty you will get a sequence. But is it the exact sequence you want? Correct math, wrong
application. The probability is 1 you will get a sequence, but much
less likely you could correctly call out each card as it’s dealt (This is
also sometimes illustrated as a group of monkeys randomly typing out the
works of Shakespeare).  The card example illustrates a common mistake in the application of
statistics, and statistical mistakes can be difficult to uncover. As
already noted, if such improbable events really do happen commonly,
they’re not so improbable, are they (by definition)? But since the odds
calculation is correct (it’s not an error in math), it must be the application of knowledge.  Let’s turn to Physicist Richard Feynman to explain the faulty
reasoning and the professor’s error immediately becomes obvious. For
those who might not know, Feynman was a Nobel-prize winning physicist
involved in The Manhattan Project, and on the panel investigating the space
shuttle Challenger disaster. But perhaps best known for a series of
undergraduate lectures captured in the famous “Feynman lectures on Physics”, Feynman
had the ability to illustrate complex problems simply.   What came to Feynman by “common sense” were often
brilliant twists that perfectly captured the essence of his point.
Once, during a public lecture, he was trying to explain why one must not
verify an idea using the same data that suggested the idea in the first
place. Seeming to wander off the subject, Feynman began talking about
license plates. “You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I
was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the
parking lot. And you won’t believe what happened. I saw a car with the
license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates
in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one
tonight? Amazing!” A point even many scientists fail to grasp was
made clear through Feynman’s remarkable “common sense”. (“The Feynman
Lectures on Physics Volume I” , Feynman, Leighton, Sands page xi-xii)   Feynman makes Professor Paulos’ mistake
with the cards clear — it’s not an error in math ,
it’s an error in science . The issue with cards relating to
evolution isn’t that any given sequence is wildly improbable, yet a
sequence comes up — when dealing cards it’s a
statistical certainty a sequence will occur (probability
one). The correct example relating to evolution would be to predict
each card as it is dealt (probability zero).  Physicist Feynman illustrates the difficulty when applying
mathematical statistics to science. It’s quite easy to make a mistake,
even for a professor of mathematics; Feynman illustrates the error through
his license plate example. Don’t be misled by lengthly, complicated
examples — anyone truly understanding a subject should be able to
explain it simply, as Feynman did. Sometimes (though certainly not
always), the complicated explanation simply provides a way to mask the
uncertainty involved (In Physics we called that “hand-waving” — the idea being to
distract from a lack of substance).   Feynman was once asked by a Caltech faculty member to
explain why spin 1/2 particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. He gauged
his audience perfectly and said “I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it”.
But a few days later he returned and said “You know, I couldn’t do it. I
couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don’t
understand it”. (“The Feynman Lectures on Physics Volume I” ,
Feynman, Leighton, Sands page xii)   Predicting a sequence of cards as it is dealt is
impossible and correctly displays the improbability of evolution. The
probability of evolution occurring rounds down to zero — it’s not
going to happen.

It is a human tendency to search for meaning, and what could be more meaningful than the belief that our lives have a greater purpose, that all life in fact is guided by a supreme intelligence which manifests itself even at the level of individual molecules?  Proponents of intelligent design believe that the components of life are so complex that they could not possibly have been produced by an evolutionary process. To bolster their argument, they calculate the odds that a specific protein might assemble by chance in the prebiotic environment. The odds against such a chance assembly are so astronomically immense that a protein required for life to begin could not possibly have assembled by chance on the early Earth.  Therefore, the argument goes, life must have been designed. It is not my purpose to argue against this belief, but the intelligent design argument uses a statistical tool of science -- a probability calculation  -- to make a point, so I will use another tool of science, which is to propose an alternative hypothesis and test it.  In living cells, most catalysts are protein enzymes, composed of amino acids, but in the 1980s another kind of catalyst was discovered. These are RNA molecules composed of nucleotides that are now called ribozymes. Because a ribozyme can act both as a catalyst and as a carrier of genetic information in its nucleotide sequence, it has been proposed that life passed through an RNA World phase that did not require DNA and proteins. For the purposes of today’s column I will go through the probability  calculation that a specific ribozyme might assemble by chance. Assume that the ribozyme is 300 nucleotides long, and that at each position there could be any of four nucleotides present. The chances of that ribozyme assembling are then 4^300,  a number so large that it could not possibly happen by chance even once in 13 billion years, the age of the universe.  But life DID begin! Could we be missing something?  The answer, of course, is yes, we are. The calculation assumes that a single specific ribozyme must be synthesized for life to begin, but that’s not how it works. Instead,  let’s make the plausible assumption that an enormous number of random polymers are synthesized, which are then subject to selection and evolution. This is the alternative hypothesis, and we can test it. Now I will recall a classic experiment by David Bartel and Jack Szostak, published in Science in 1993. Their goal was to see if a completely random system of molecules could undergo selection in such a way that defined species of molecules emerged with specific properties. They began by synthesizing many trillions of different RNA molecules about 300 nucleotides long, but the nucleotides were all random nucleotide sequences. Nucleotides, by the way, are monomers of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, just as amino acids are the monomers, or subunits, of proteins, and making random sequences is easy to do with modern methods of molecular biology.  They reasoned that buried in those trillions were a few catalytic RNA molecules called ribozymes that happened to catalyze a ligation reaction, in which one strand of RNA is linked to a second strand. The RNA strands to be ligated were attached to small beads on a column, then were exposed to the trillions of random sequences simply by flushing them through the column. This process could fish out any RNA molecules that happened to have even a weak ability to catalyze the reaction. They then amplified those molecules and put them back in for a second round, repeating the process for 10 rounds. By the way, this is the same basic logic that breeders use when they select for a property such as coat color in dogs. The results were amazing. After only 4 rounds of selection and amplification they began to see an increase in catalytic activity, and after 10 rounds the rate was 7 million times faster than the uncatalyzed rate. It was even possible to watch the RNA evolve. Nucleic acids can be separated and visualized by a technique called gel electrophoresis. The mixture is put in at the top of a gel held between two glass plates and a voltage is applied. Small molecules travel fastest through the gel, and larger molecules move more slowly, so they are separated. In this case, RNA molecules having a specific length produce a visible band in a gel. At the start of the reaction, nothing could be seen, because all the molecules are different. But with each cycle new bands appeared. Some came to dominate the reaction, while others went extinct. Bartel and Szostak’s results have been repeated and extended by other researchers, and they demonstrate a fundamental principle of evolution at the molecular level. At the start of the experiment, every molecule of RNA was different from all the rest because they were assembled by a chance process. There were no species, just a mixture of trillions of different molecules. But then a selective hurdle was imposed, a ligation reaction that allowed only certain molecules to survive and reproduce enzymatically.  In a few generations groups of molecules began to emerge that displayed ever-increasing catalytic function. In other words, species of molecules appeared out of this random mixture in an evolutionary process that closely reflects the natural selection that Darwin outlined for populations of higher animals. These RNA molecules were defined by the sequence of bases in their structures, which caused them to fold into specific conformations that had catalytic properties. The sequences were in essence analogous to genes, because the information they contained was passed between generations during the amplification process. The Bartel and Szostak experiment directly refutes the argument that the odds are stacked against an origin of life by natural processes. The inescapable conclusion is that genetic information can in fact emerge from random mixtures of polymers, as long as the populations contain large numbers of polymeric molecules with variable monomer sequences, and a way to select and amplify a specific property. I will close with a quote from Freeman Dyson, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University who also enjoys thinking about the origin of life: “You  had what I call the garbage bag model. The early cells were just  little bags of some kind of cell membrane, which might have been  oily or it might have been a metal oxide.  And inside you  had a more or less random collection of organic molecules, with the  characteristic that small molecules could diffuse in through the  membrane, but big molecules could not diffuse out. By converting  small molecules into big molecules, you could concentrate the organic  contents on the inside, so the cells would become more concentrated  and the chemistry would gradually become more efficient. So these  things could evolve without any kind of replication.  It's a  simple statistical inheritance.  When a cell became so big that  it got cut in half, or shaken in half, by some rainstorm or environmental  disturbance, it would then produce two cells which would be its daughters,  which would inherit, more or less, but only statistically, the chemical  machinery inside.  Evolution could work under those conditions.”     Stars, Planets, Life    More Articles  What's It Like For a Working Scientist To Write a Novel?

MORRIS, PH.D.  | SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 01, 2003             Download
        The Mathematical Impossibility Of Evolution        PDF     ICR began publishing its popular free newsletter Acts & Facts in June 1972, over 31 years ago. The first two issues were 6-page, single-column, fold-over tract-like papers, black-and-white—not very impressive in appearance.  Issue No. 1 contained only news items describing some of our early campus meetings. Specially featured was the meeting held by Dr. Duane Gish on the Davis campus of the University of California. This was the meeting that involved an unscheduled 2½ hour debate with world-famous evolutionist, G. Ledyard Stebbins. A favorable response from the large student attendance and a very positive write-up in the student paper eventually led to Dr. Gish's famous cartoon booklet, Have You Been Brainwashed? which has been greatly used by the Lord in the past three decades, being distributed in the millions all over the world.  That issue also announced the publication of Dr. Gish's first book, Evolution: The Fossils Say No! which has been used widely and has won many evolutionists to accept the truth of special creation.  Issue No. 2 also was mostly news, but it did contain a semi-technical article on "The Mathematical Impossibility of Evolution" which is being reproduced herein as a matter of interest—not only of historical interest as the forerunner of our popular Impact articles (the first of which was published in the first 1973 issue), but also because it still seems to show in a very simple way that evolution is impossible—no one, to my knowledge, has ever tried to refute it.  The third issue of Acts & Facts reported on the first ICR-sponsored expedition to Mount Ararat in search of Noah's Ark, led by John Morris. The first Impact article, however, was published in the January/February 1973 issue on the subject, "Evolution, Creation, and the Public Schools , " urging that concerned citizens should use an educational and persuasion approach, rather than legislation or litigation, in trying to get a balanced approach to origins teaching accepted in the public schools.  In spite of this advice, however, many well-meaning creationists have tried—always unsuccessfully—to try to force this issue. We still recommend education and persuasion as the best policy.  Anyway, an Impact article on significant scientific or apologetics topics has been published every month since that first 1973 Acts & Facts . The forerunner of all these, still quite valid, I believe, is reproduced with a few modifications below:  The Mathematical Impossibility of Evolution  According to the most-widely accepted theory of evolution today, the sole mechanism for producing evolution is that of random mutation combined with natural selection. Mutations are random changes in genetic systems. Natural selection is considered by evolutionists to be a sort of sieve, which retains the "good" mutations and allows the others to pass away.  Since random changes in ordered systems almost always will decrease the amount of order in those systems, nearly all mutations are harmful to the organisms which experience them. Nevertheless, the evolutionist insists that each complex organism in the world today has arisen by a long string of gradually accumulated good mutations preserved by natural selection. No one has ever actually observed a genuine mutation occurring in the natural environment which was beneficial (that is, adding useful genetic information to an existing genetic code), and therefore, retained by the selection process. For some reason, however, the idea has a certain persuasive quality about it and seems eminently reasonable to many people—until it is examined quantitatively , that is!  For example, consider a very simple putative organism composed of only 200 integrated and functioning parts, and the problem of deriving that organism by this type of process. The system presumably must have started with only one part and then gradually built itself up over many generations into its 200-part organization. The developing organism, at each successive stage, must itself be integrated and functioning in its environment in order to survive until the next stage. Each successive stage, of course, becomes statistically less likely than the preceding one, since it is far easier for a complex system to break down than to build itself up. A four-component integrated system can more easily "mutate" (that is, somehow suddenly change) into a three-component system (or even a four-component non-functioning system) than into a five-component integrated system. If, at any step in the chain, the system mutates "downward," then it is either destroyed altogether or else moves backward, in an evolutionary sense.  Therefore, the successful production of a 200-component functioning organism requires, at least , 200 successive, successful such "mutations," each of which is highly unlikely. Even evolutionists recognize that true mutations are very rare, and beneficial mutations are extremely rare—not more than one out of a thousand mutations are beneficial, at the very most.  But let us give the evolutionist the benefit of every consideration. Assume that, at each mutational step, there is equally as much chance for it to be good as bad. Thus, the probability for the success of each mutation is assumed to be one out of two, or one-half. Elementary statistical theory shows that the probability of 200 successive mutations being successful is then (½) 200 , or one chance out of 10 60 . The number 10 60 , if written out, would be "one" followed by sixty "zeros." In other words, the chance that a 200-component organism could be formed by mutation and natural selection is less than one chance out of a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion! Lest anyone think that a 200-part system is unreasonably complex, it should be noted that even a one-celled plant or animal may have millions of molecular "parts."  The evolutionist might react by saying that even though any one such mutating organism might not be successful, surely some around the world would be, especially in the 10 billion years (or 10 18 seconds) of assumed earth history. Therefore, let us imagine that every one of the earth's 10 14 square feet of surface harbors a billion (i.e., 10 9 ) mutating systems and that each mutation requires one-half second (actually it would take far more time than this). Each system can thus go through its 200 mutations in 100 seconds and then, if it is unsuccessful, start over for a new try. In 10 18 seconds, there can, therefore, be 10 18 /10 2 , or 10 16 , trials by each mutating system. Multiplying all these numbers together, there would be a total possible number of attempts to develop a 200-component system equal to 10 14 (10 9 ) (10 16 ), or 10 39 attempts. Since the probability against the success of any one of them is 10 60 , it is obvious that the probability that just one of these 10 39 attempts might be successful is only one out of 10 60 /10 39 , or 10 21 .  All this means that the chance that any kind of a 200-component integrated functioning organism could be developed by mutation and natural selection just once, anywhere in the world, in all the assumed expanse of geologic time, is less than one chance out of a billion trillion. What possible conclusion, therefore, can we derive from such considerations as this except that evolution by mutation and natural selection is mathematically and logically indefensible!  Discussion   There have been many other ways in which creationist writers have used probability arguments to refute evolutionism, especially the idea of random changes preserved, if beneficial, by natural selection. James Coppedge devoted almost an entire book, Evolution: Possible or Impossible (Zondervan, 1973, 276 pp.), to this type of approach. I have also used other probability-type arguments to the same end (see, e.g., Science and Creation , Master Books, pp. 161-201).  The first such book, so far as I know, to use mathematics and probability in refuting evolution was written by a pastor, W. A. Williams, way back in 1928. Entitled, Evolution Disproved , it made a great impression on me when I first read it about 1943, at a time when I myself was still struggling with evolution.  In fact, evolutionists themselves have attacked traditional Darwinism on the same basis (see the Wistar Institute Symposium, Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution, 1967, 140 pp.). While these scientists did not reject evolution itself, they did insist that the Darwinian randomness postulate would never work.  Furthermore, since the law of increasing entropy, or the second law of thermodynamics, is essentially a statement of probabilities, many writers have also used that law itself to show that evolution on any significant scale is essentially impossible. Evolutionists have usually ignored the arguments or else used vacuous arguments against them ("Anything can happen given enough time"; "The earth is an open system, so the second law doesn't apply"; "Order can arise out of chaos through dissipative structures"; etc.).  In the real world of scientific observation, as opposed to metaphysical speculation, however, no more complex system can ever "evolve" out of a less complex system, so the probability of the naturalistic origin of even the simplest imaginary form of life is zero.  The existence of complexity of any kind is evidence of God and creation. "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth" ( Isaiah 40:26 ).

The odds that evolution is true have actually been calculated.    Not surprisingly, a huge number of scientists have tried to calculate the probability of life arising by a chemical accident. The results of their calculations reveal the enormity of the dilemma faced by evolutionists. In the 1970’s British astronomer Sir Frederick Hoyle, an evolutionist, set out to calculate the mathematical probability of the spontaneous origin of life from a primordial soup environment.  Applying the laws of chemistry, mathematical probability and thermodynamics, he calculated the odds of the spontaneous generation of the simplest known free-living life form on earth - a bacterium. He determined that the probability of such an event is one chance in ten to the 40 thousandth power. Hoyle stated: “the likelihood of the formation of life from inanimate matter is one to a number with 40 thousand zeros after it. It is enough to bury Darwin and the whole theory of evolution, he said.  Mathematicians tell us if an event has a probability which is less likely than one chance in 10 to just the 50th power, then that event is mathematically impossible. Again we’re talking about one chance in ten to the 40 thousandth power. Prior to his project, Hoyle was a believer in the spontaneous generation of life. This project, however, changed his opinion 180 degrees. Now look around you at the abundance of life you see. How impossible is it that all of what you observed just accidentally formed. If you’re honest with yourself, you must admit the odds of it being accidental are impossible. The only other option is that it was created by God.

By JOHN ALLEN PAULOS  Sept. 3, 2006   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      A recent international study in the journal Science by Professor Jon Miller of Michigan State University and his associates finds that a growing number of Americans do not believe in the theory of evolution. In fact, the survey of 32 European nations and Japan reveals that only Turkey has a higher percentage of its citizens rejecting Darwin. The author attributes the results in the United States to religious fundamentalism, inadequate science education, and partisan political maneuvering. With regard to the latter Miller notes, "There is no major political party in Europe and Japan that uses opposition to evolution as a part of its political platform." But there's another contributing factor to this opposition to evolution that I'd like to discuss here. It is the concerted attempt by creationists to dress up in the garb of mathematics fundamentalist claims about human origins and to focus criticism on what they take to be the minuscule probability of evolutionary development. (Even the conservative television pundit and ace biologist Ann Coulter has lent her perspicacity to this mathematical endeavor in her recent book.) Creationists argue that the likelihood of, say, a new species of horse developing is absurdly tiny. The same, they say, is true of the development of the eye or the mechanism for blood clotting.  Creationists' Argument  A bit more specifically, the standard argument goes roughly as follows. A very long sequence of individually improbable mutations must occur in order for a species or a biological process to evolve. If we assume these are independent events, then the probability of all of them occurring and occurring in the right order is the product of their respective probabilities, which is always an extremely tiny number. Thus, for example, the probability of getting a 3, 2, 6, 2, and 5 when rolling a single die five times is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 or 1/7,776 -- one chance in 7,776. The much longer sequences of fortuitous events necessary for a new species or a new process to evolve leads to the minuscule numbers that creationists argue prove that evolution is so wildly improbable as to be essentially impossible.   The Flaw  This line of argument, however, is deeply flawed. Leaving aside the issue of independent events, which is too extensive to discuss here, I note that there are always a fantastically huge number of evolutionary paths that might be taken by an organism (or a process) over time. I also note that there is only one that actually will be taken. So if, after the fact, we observe the particular evolutionary path actually taken and then calculate the a priori probability of its being taken, we will get the minuscule probability that creationists mistakenly attach to the process as a whole. Misunderstanding this tiny probability, they reject outright the evolutionary process. Here's another example. We have a deck of cards before us. There are almost 10 to the 68th power -- a one with 68 zeroes after it -- orderings of the 52 cards in the deck. Any of the 52 cards might be first, any of the remaining 51 second, any of the remaining 50 third, and so on. This is a humongous number, but it's not hard to devise even everyday situations that give rise to much larger numbers. Now if we shuffle this deck of cards for a long time and then examine the particular ordering of the cards that happens to result, we would be justified in concluding that the probability of this particular ordering of the cards having occurred is approximately 1 chance in 10 to the 68th power. This certainly qualifies as minuscule. Still, we would not be justified in concluding that the shuffles could not have possibly resulted in this particular ordering because its a priori probability is so very tiny. Some ordering had to result from the shuffling, and this one did. Nor, of course, would we be justified in concluding that the whole process of moving from one ordering to another via shuffles is so wildly improbable as to be practically impossible. The actual result of the shufflings will always have a minuscule probability of occurring, but, unless you're a creationist, that doesn't mean the process of obtaining the result is at all dubious.  The Science study is disturbing for many reasons, not the least of which is that there's no telling to what length the creationist trunk of the G.O.P. elephant will evolve.

Return to main evolution page    David H. Bailey 14 February 2018 (c) 2018  Introduction Both traditional creationists and intelligent design writers have invoked probability arguments in criticisms of biological evolution. They argue that certain features of biology are so fantastically improbable that they could never have been produced by a purely natural, "random" process, even assuming the billions of years of history asserted by geologists and astronomers.  They often equate the hypothesis of evolution to the absurd suggestion that monkeys randomly typing at a typewriter could compose a selection from the works of Shakepeare, or that an explosion in an aerospace equipment yard could produce a working 747 airliner [ Dembski1998 ; Foster1991 ; Hoyle1981 ; Lennox2009 ]. One creationist-intelligent design argument goes like this: the human alpha-globin molecule, a component of hemoglobin that performs a key oxygen transfer function, is a protein chain based on a sequence of 141 amino acids.  There are 20 different amino acids common in living systems, so the number of potential chains of length 141 is 20 141 , which is roughly 10 183 (i.e., a one followed by 183 zeroes).  These writers argue that this figure is so enormous that even after billions of years of random molecular trials, no human alpha-globin protein molecule would ever appear "at random," and thus the hypothesis that human alpha-globin arose by an evolutionary process is decisively refuted  [ Foster1991 , pg. 79-83; Hoyle1981 , pg. 1-20; Lennox2009 , pg. 163-173]. The treacherous world of probability and statistics While not generally appreciated by the public at large, it is a well-known fact in the world of scientific research that arguments based on probability and statistics are fraught with potential fallacies and errors. For these reasons, rigorous courses in probability and statistics are now required of students in virtually all fields of science, and in numerous other disciplines as well.  Attorneys need to be at least moderately well-versed in probability and statistics arguments and how they can go awry in the courtroom arguments [ Saini2009 ]. In the finance world, statistical overfitting and other errors of probability and statistics are now thought to be a leading reason behind the fact that strategies and investment funds which look great on paper often disappoint in real-world usage [ Bailey2014 ]. To illustrate the difficulties with probability arguments, mathematics teachers often ask their class (let's say it has 30 students) if they think it is likely that two or more persons in the class have exactly the same birthday.  Most students say that it is highly unlikely, thinking that the chances that two people have the same particular birthday is 1/365, and so 30 times this amount is only 30/365. But this argument is fallacious, since, for example, in a class of 30 students there are 435 pairs of students.  When the probability calculation is done correctly for the case of 30 students [it is equal to 1 - (364/365 x 363/365 x ... x 336/365)], one obtains 70.6%.  In general, if there are 23 or more students in the class, then the chances that two or more have the same birthday is greater than 50%. For numerous other examples of how seemingly improbable "coincidences" can happen, see [ Hand2014 ]. Fallacies in the creationist probability arguments One major fallacy in the alpha-globin argument mentioned above, common to many others of this genre, is that it ignores the fact that a large class of alpha-globin molecules can perform the essential oxygen transfer function, so that the computation of the probability of a single instance is misleadingly remote.  Indeed, most of the 141 amino acids in alpha-globin can be changed without altering the key oxygen transfer function, as can be seen by noting the great variety in alpha-globin molecules across the animal kingdom (see DNA ).
When one revises the calculation above, based on only 25 locations essential for the oxygen transport function (which is a generous over-estimate), one obtains 10 33 fundamentally different chains, a enormous figure but vastly smaller than 10 183 . A calculation such as this can be refined further, taking into account other features of alpha-globin and its related biochemistry.  Some of these calculations produce probability values even more extreme than the above.  But do any of these calculations really matter? The main problem is that all such calculations, whether done accurately or not, suffer from the fatal fallacy of presuming that a structure such as human alpha-globin arose by a single all-at-once random trial event. But generating a molecule "at random" in a single shot is decidedly not the scientific hypothesis in question -- this is a creationist theory, not a scientific theory.  Instead, available evidence from hundreds of published studies on the topic has demonstrated that alpha-globin arose as the end product of a long sequence of intermediate steps, each of which was biologically useful in an earlier context.  See, for example, the survey article [ Hardison2001 ], which cites 144 papers on the topic of hemoglobin evolution. In short, it does not matter how good or how bad the mathematics used in the analysis is, if the underlying model is a fundamentally invalid description of the phenomenon in question.  Any simplistic probability calculation of evolution that does not take into account the step-by-step process by which the structure came to be is almost certainly fallacious and can easily mislead [ Musgrave1998 ]. What's more, such calculations completely ignore the atomic-level biochemical processes involved, which often exhibit strong affinities for certain types of highly ordered structures.  For example, molecular self-assembly occurs in DNA molecule duplication every time a cell divides.  If we were to compute the chances of the formation of a human DNA molecule during meiosis, using a simple-minded probability calculation similar to that mentioned above, the result would be something on the order of one in 10 1,000,000,000 , which is far, far beyond the possibility of "random" assemblage.  Yet this process occurs millions of times every day in the human body. Is evolution a "random" process? It is also important to keep in mind that the process of natural biological evolution is not really a "random" process.  Evolution certainly has some "random" aspects, notably mutations and genetic events during reproduction.  But the all-important process of natural selection, acting under the pressure of an extremely competitive landscape, often involving thousands of other individuals of the same species and other species as well, together with numerous complicated environmental pressures such as climate change, is anything but random.  This strongly directional nature of natural selection, which is the essence of evolution, by itself invalidates most of these probability calculations. Hemoglobin and chlorophyll With regards to hemoglobin, in particular, it has long been noted that heme, the key oxygen-carrying component of hemoglobin, is remarkably similar to chlorophyll, the molecule behind photosynthesis.  The principal difference is that heme has a central iron atom, whereas chlorophyll has a central magnesium atom; otherwise they are virtually identical.  This similarity can hardly be a coincidence, and in fact researchers concluded long ago that these two biomolecules must have shared a common lineage (meaning, of course, that organisms which incorporate these biomolecules must have shared a common lineage) [ Hendry1980 ].  Here is a diagram of the two molecules [from MasterOrganicChemistry.com ]:   Snowflakes Some of the difficulties with creationist probability arguments can be illustrated by considering snowflakes.  Bentley and Humphrey's book Snow Crystals includes over 2000 high-resolution black-and-white photos of real snowflakes, each with intricate yet highly regular patterns that are almost perfectly six-way symmetric [ Bentley1962 ].  A good online source with numerous high-resolution photographs has been compiled by Kenneth Libbrecht [ Libbrecht2012 ].  Four of Bentley's photos are shown below.  By employing a reckoning based on six-way symmetry, one can calculate the chances that one of these structures can form "at random" as roughly one part in 10 2500 .  This probability figure is even more extreme than some that have appeared in the creationist-intelligent design literature.  So is this proof that each individual snowflake has been designed by a supernatural intelligent entity?  Obviously not. The fallacy here, once again, is presuming an all-at-once random assembly of molecules.  Instead, snowflakes, like biological organisms, are formed as the product of a long series of steps acting under well-known physical laws, and the outcomes of such processes very sensitively depend on the starting conditions and numerous environmental parameters.  It is thus folly to presume that one can correctly reckon the chances of a given outcome by means of superficial probability calculations that ignore the processes by which they formed.        Can English text be generated "at random"? As mentioned above, some critics have equated the notion of natural evolution to the absurd suggestion that some monkeys typing randomly at a keyboard could generate a passage of Shakespeare.  But this too is a fallacious argument. A recent study exhibited results of a computer program simulating natural evolution, which "evolved" segments of English text very much akin to actual passages from Charles Dickens.  In many instances, a class of college students were unable to distinguish the computer-generated text segments from real text segments taken from Dickens' Great Expectations .  See English-text for details. Along this line, computer programs have been written that mimic the process of biological evolution to produce novel solutions to engineering problems, in many cases superior to the best human efforts, in an approach that has been termed "genetic algorithms" or "evolutionary computing."  As a single example, in 2017 Google researchers generated 1000 image recognition algorithms, each of which were trained using state-of-the-art deep neural networks to recognize a selected set of images.  They then used an array of 250 computers, each running two algorithms, to identify an image.  Only the algorithm that scored higher proceeded to the next iteration, where it was changed somewhat, mimicking mutations in natural evolution. Google researchers found that their scheme could achieve accuracies as high as 94.6% [ Gershgorn2017 ]. Closely related are advances in artificial intelligence, in which a set of computer programs "compete" to produce a superior program.  One notable example is the 2016 defeat of the world's top Go player by a computer program named AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, in an event that surprised observers who had not expected this for decades, if ever.  Then in 2017, DeepMind announced even more remarkable results: their researchers had started from scratch, programming a computer with only the rules of Go, together with a "deep learning" algorithm, and then had the program play games against itself.  Within a few days it had advanced to the point that it defeated the earlier champion-beating AlphaGo program 100 games to zero.  After one month, the program's rating was as far above the world champion as the world champion was above a typical amateur [ Greenmeier2017 ]. As an example of the many mathematical studies of evolution, researchers showed mathematically that there was plenty of time in the geologic record for evolution to have produced the complexity in nature [ Wilf2010 ]. Improbable structures and features in nature Numerous examples from the natural world can be cited to demonstrate the futility of trying to argue against evolution using probability -- nature can and often does produce highly improbable structures and features, by the normal process of evolution:  Lenski's 2012 E. coli experiment : In January 2012, a research team led by Richard Lenski at Michigan State University demonstrated that colonies of viruses can evolve a new trait in as little as 15 days.  The researchers studied a virus, known as "lambda," which infects only the bacterium E. coli.  They engineered a strain of E. coli that had almost none of the molecules that this virus normally attaches to, then released them into the virus colony.  In 24 of 96 separate experimental lines, the viruses evolved a strain that enabled them to attach to E. coli, using a new molecule that they had never before been observed to utilize.  All of the successful runs utilized essentially the same set of four distinct mutations.  Justin Meyer, a member of the research team, noted that the chances of all four mutations arising "at random" in a given experimental line (based on a superficial probability argument) are roughly one in 10 27 (one thousand trillion trillion) [ Zimmer2012 ].  Note also that the chances for this to happen in 24 out of 96 experimental lines are roughly one in 10 626 .   Synthesis of RNA nucleotides and other biomolecules :  Many scientists hypothesize that RNA (a molecule similar to DNA) was involved in the origin of life (see Origin ).  But as recently as a few years ago, even producing the four nucleotides (components) of RNA on the primitive Earth was  thought to be a "near miracle."  Nonetheless, in May 2009 a team led by John Sutherland of the University of Manchester discovered a particular combination of chemicals, very likely to have been plentiful on the early Earth, that formed the RNA nucleotide ribocytidine phosphate.  By exposing the mixture to ultraviolet light, a second nucleotide of RNA was formed [ Wade2009 ].  Then in May 2016, one of the remaining two was synthesized, by a team in Munich, Germany [ Service2016 ].  Sutherland's group also recently showed that two simple compounds, which almost certainly were abundant on the early Earth, can launch a cascade of chemical reactions that can produce all three major classes of biomolecules: nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids [ Wade2015a ].  In short, the natural production of biomolecules once thought to be "impossible" is now fairly well understood.   Hawaiian crickets : In the 1990s, a population of crickets in Hawaii (a species introduced to the islands over 100 years ago) became victims of dive-bombing flies that targeted male crickets who were chirping to attract mates, then implanted their larvae in them.  Recently, when researchers visited a region in Kauai that previously was the home to many of these chirping crickets, it was now completely silent, and they feared the crickets were now extinct in the area.  Fortunately, nighttime searches found that in fact there were lots of crickets there, but very few of the males now chirped.  Further study found that in just five years, or roughly 20 generations, a rather improbable mutation had arisen that inhibited the males from chirping, and this genetic trait had now spread to almost the entire population [ Zuk2013 , pg. 81-82].   Tibetan high-altitude genes : In 2010, researchers analyzing DNA found that natives of the Tibetan highlands possess 30 unique genes that permit them to live well at very high altitudes: the genes foster more efficient metabolism, prevent the overproduction of red blood cells, and generate higher levels of substances that transmit oxygen to tissue.  Given that the Tibetans separated from other Han Chinese only about 3,000 years ago, this is thought to be one of the fastest documented cases of evolution in humans [ Wade2010b ].  Many other examples could be listed -- see Novelty and Origin . Dembski's information theory arguments Intelligent design writer William Dembski invokes both probability and information theory (the mathematical theory of information content in data) in his arguments against Darwinism [e.g., Dembski2002 ].  However, mathematicians who have examined Dembski's works have identified major flaws in his reasoning [ Elsberry2011 ].  For a detailed discussion of Dembski's theories, see Information theory . Does creationism provide a reasonable alternative? Does a creationist worldview, in particular the hypothesis of independent creation of each species with no common biological ancestry, provide a reasonable alternative in terms of probability? Here it is instructive to consider transposons or "jumping genes," namely sections of DNA that have been "copied" from one part of an organism's genome and "pasted" seemingly at random in other locations.  The human genome, for example, has over four million individual transposons in over 800 families [ Mills2007 ].  In most cases transposons do no harm, because they "land" in an unused section of DNA, but because they are inherited they serve as excellent markers for genetic studies.  Indeed, transposons have been used to classify a large number of vertebrate species into a family tree, with a result that is virtually identical to what biologists had earlier reckoned based only physical features and biological functions [ Rogers2011 , pg. 25-31, 86-92].  As just one example, consider the following table, where columns labeled ABCDE denote five blocks of transposons, and x and o denote that the block is present or absent in the genome [ Rogers2011 , pg. 89]. Transposon blocks
			Species		A	B	C	D	E
        /---------	Human		o	x	x	x	x
       /----------	Bonobo		x	x	x	x	x
      / \---------	Chimp		x	x	x	x	x
     /------------	Gorilla		o	o	x	x	x
-----|------------	Orangutan	o	o	o	x	x
     \------------	Gibbon		o	o	o	o	o It is clear from these data that our closest primate relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos.  As another example, here is a classification of four cetaceans (ocean mammals) based on transposon data  [ Rogers2011 , pg. 27]: Transposon blocks
		Species			A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P
    /------	Bottlenose dolphin	x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x
   /\------	Narwhal whale		x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x
---|-------	Sperm whale		x  x  x  x  x  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o
   \-------	Humpback whale		x  x  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o Other examples could be listed, encompassing an even broader range of species [ Rogers2011 , pg. 25-31, 86-92]. Needless to say, these data, which all but scream "descent from common ancestors," are highly problematic for creationists and others who hold that the individual species were separately created without common biological ancestry.  Transposons typically are several thousand DNA base pair letters long, but, since there are often some disagreements from species to species, let us be very conservative and say only 1000 base pair letters long.  Then for two species to share even one transposon starting at the same spot, presumably only due to random mutations since creation, the probability (according to the creationist hypothesis) is one in 4 1000 or roughly one in 10 600 .  For 16 such common transposons, the chances are one in 4 16000 or roughly one in 10 9600 .  What's more, as mentioned above, an individual species typically has at least several hundred thousand such transposons.  Including even part of these in the reckoning would hugely multiply these odds. But this is not all, because we have not yet considered the fact that in each diagram above, or in other tables of real biological transposon data, there is a clear hierarchical relationship.  This is by no means assured, and in fact is quite improbable -- for almost all tables of "random" data, there is no hierarchical pattern, and no way to the rearrange the rows to be in a hierarchical pattern.  For example, in a computer run programmed by the present author, each column of the above cetacean table was pseudorandomly shuffled (thus maintaining the same number of x and o in each column), and the program checked whether the rows of the resulting table could be rearranged to be in a hierarchical order.  There were no successes in 10,000,000 trials.  As a second experiment, a 4 x 16 table of pseudorandom data (with a 50-50 chance of x or o) was generated, and then the program attempted to rearrange the rows to be in a hierarchical pattern as before.  There were only three successes in 10,000,000 trials. Like the calculations mentioned earlier, these calculations are simplified and informal; more careful reckonings can be done, and one can vary the underlying assumptions.  But, again, do the fine details of the calculations really matter?  One way or the other, it is clear that the creationist hypothesis of separate creation does not resolve any probability paradoxes; instead it enormously magnifies them.  The only other possibility, from a strict creationist worldview, is to posit that a supreme being separately created species with hundreds of thousands of transposons already in place, essentially just as we see them today.  But this merely replaces a scientific disaster (the utter failure of the creationist model to explain the vast phylogenetic patterns in intron data) with a theological disaster (why did a truth-loving supreme being fill the genomes of the entire biological kingdom with vast amounts of misleading DNA evidence, all pointing unambiguously to an evolutionary descent from common ancestors, if that is not the conclusion we are to draw?).  Indeed, with regards to the discomfort some have about evolution, the creationist alternative of separate creation is arguably far worse, both scientifically and theologically. Conclusions It is undeniably true that there are some perplexing features of evolution from the point of view of probability.  Even at the molecular level, structures are seen that appear to be exceedingly improbable.  What is the origin of these structures?  How did they evolve to the forms we see today?  In spite of many published papers on these topics, researchers in the field would be the first to acknowledge that there is still much that is not yet fully understood. However, arguments based on probability, statistics or information theory that have appeared in the creationist-intelligent design literature do not help unravel these mysteries, because most of these arguments have serious fallacies:  They presume that a given biomolecule came into existence "at random" via an all-at-once chance assemblage of atoms.  But this is not the scientific hypothesis of how they formed; instead, numerous published studies, covering many biomolecules, indicate that these biomolecules were the result of a long series of intermediate steps over the eons, each useful in a previous biological context. Thus such arguments are fundamentally flawed from the beginning.  They apply faulty mathematical reasoning, such as by ignoring the fact that a very wide range of biomolecules could perform a similar function to the given biomolecule.  Thus the odds they provide against the formation of the given biomolecule are greatly exaggerated.  They ignore the fact that biological evolution is fundamentally not a purely "random" process -- mutations may be random, but natural selection is far from random.  They ignore reams of evidence from the natural world that evolution can and often does produce highly improbable structures and features.  Some writers attempt to invoke advanced mathematical concepts (e.g., information theory), but derive highly questionable results and misapply these results in ways that render the conclusions invalid in an evolutionary biology context.  The creationist hypothesis of separate creation for each species does not resolve any probability paradoxes; instead it enormously magnifies them.  It is ironic that to the extent that such probability-based arguments have any validity at all, it is precisely the creationist hypothesis of separate, all-at-once complete formation that is falsified. Perhaps at some time in the distant future, a super-powerful computer will be able simulate with convincing fidelity the multi-billion-year biological history of the earth, in the same way that scientists today attempt to simulate (in a much more modest scope) the earth's weather and climate.  Then, after thousands of such simulations have been performed, with different starting conditions, we might obtain some meaningful statistics on the chances involved in the origin of life, or in the formation of some class of biological structures such as hemoglobin, or in the rise of intelligent creatures such as ourselves. Until that time, probability calculations such as those that appear in creationist-intelligent design literature should be viewed with great skepticism, to say the least. In a larger context, one has to question whether highly technical issues such as calculations of probabilities have any place in a discussion of religion.  Why attempt to "prove" God with probability, particularly when there are very serious questions as to whether such reasoning is valid?  One is reminded of a passage in the New Testament:  "For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?" [1 Cor. 14:8].  It makes far more sense to leave such matters to peer-reviewed scientific research. See DNA , English text , Information theory , Origin and Deceiver for additional related discussion.

Home The Probability of Life       Creationists have long asserted that the chances of life forming naturally are so remote that they could not have happened. Read about how, in fact, the chances are much wider than most think.  by Richard Peacock      Creationists often claim that the chances of a modern enzyme forming by random means are astronomically small, and therefore the chances of a complete bacterium (which is composed of hundreds or thousands of such enzymes & proteins) is so near to impossible that it would never happen in the 13 billion years or so since the universe took shape.  The main problem with this argument is that it assumes abiogenesis (the initial formation of life from simpler molecules) was a totally random process. It also assumes that in order for abiogenesis to be successful, a complete microbe would have had to form spontaneously. In fact, the same non-random forces which propel biological evolution also propelled abiogenesis. Specifically, Natural Selection.  The calculation which supports the creationist argument begins with the probability of a 300-molecule-long protein forming by total random chance. This would be approximately 1 chance in 10 390 . This number is astoundingly huge. By comparison, the number of all the atoms in the observable universe is 10 80 . So, if a simple protein has that unlikely chance of forming, what hope does a complete bacterium have?  If this were the theory of abiogeneisis, and if it relied entirely on random chance, then yes, it would be impossible for life to form in this way. However, this is not the case.  Abiogenesis was a long process with many small incremental steps, all governed by the non-random forces of Natural Selection and chemistry. The very first stages of abiogenesis were no more than simple self-replicating molecules, which might hardly have been called alive at all.  For example, the simplest theorized self-replicating peptide is only 32 amino acids long. The probability of it forming randomly, in sequential trials, is approximately 1 in 10 40 , which is much more likely than the 1 in 10 390 claim creationists often cite.  Though, to be fair, 10 40 is still a very large number. It would still take an incredibly large number of sequential trials before the peptide would form. But remember that in the prebiotic oceans of the early Earth, there would be billions of trials taking place simultaneously as the oceans, rich in amino acids, were continuously churned by the tidal forces of the moon and the harsh weather conditions of the Earth.  In fact, if we assume the volume of the oceans were 10 24 liters, and the amino acid concentration was 10 -6 M (which is actually very dilute), then almost 10 31 self-replicating peptides would form in under a year, let alone millions of years. So, even given the difficult chances of 1 in 10 40 , the first stages of abiogenesis could have started very quickly indeed.   Please note: this article uses a hypothetical self-replicating peptide as a model molecule for these calculations.  The current theories of abiogenesis are usually based on the "RNA World" theory, where in fact self-replication was first acheived through RNA molecules, rather than DNA molecules.

One of the breakout sessions featured a fellow from the Heritage Foundation (an ultra-right-wing political think tank) presenting a lecture about probability and evolution.  His talk was mostly just a watered-down version of William Dembski’s standard talking points.  His triumphant conclusion was that the probability of something or other having evolved by natural processes was one over something enormous, from which he concluded that evolution had been refuted.  There were only about fifteen of us in the room.  During the subsequent question period, one older gentleman said something very close to this: “When scientists are confronted with a probability that small…”  He paused here, as though struggling to accept just how small a number it was.  “What else can they do but just stare at it helplessly?”  I was the next to speak.  I said, “I think I can tell you how they would react to that calculation.  They would question the legitimacy of the assumptions that went into it.”  I then rattled off three implausible assumptions underlying the calculation.  The other fellow just stared at me.  The speaker, incredibly, replied that this was just a popular level presentation, and then rattled off several additional points of disanalogy between his calculation and reality.  He seemed to think that was a good answer.  I replied that the problem wasn’t simply that certain details had been left out of the calculation to keep it manageable.  It was that the variables that were missing could not be quantified with any accuracy.  Consequently, absolutely nothing like what he was doing could be made to work.  He just shrugged and went on to the next question.  Creationists love probability.  If you are a speaker trying to bamboozle a lay audience, there is no better way than to drop in a back-of-the-envelope calculation.  The trouble is that the things they are trying to quantify are inherently unquantifiable.  There is no way to calculate the probability of an eye, for example, evolving over the course of millions of years of evolution by natural selection.  The young-Earthers typically try to circumvent this point by ignoring the role of selection.  They typically toss off combinatorial arguments in which the probability of evolving some complex molecule, like hemoglobin, is taken to be one over the number of ways of arranging the amino acids in that molecule.  Sadly, that only works if all of those arrangements are equiprobable, but the continuing action of natural selection ensures that they are not.  The ID folks try to gum up the works with blather about specificity or universal probability bounds.  But when it comes time to perform specific probability calculations (something they almost never do) they inevitably invoke “irreducible complexity” as an excuse for ignoring the role of natural selection.  That is not a reasonable thing to do, to put it kindly.  I was thinking about this while reading this post over at Uncommon Descent.  Jonathan M. writes:  A couple months ago, I took an online “moodle” class with the Center for Inquiry on the topic of the evolution debate. The instructor was the renowned philosopher and evolutionary biologist, Massimo Pigliucci. I entered into an exchange of dialogue with Pigliucci and the other students on the evidence for the efficacy of naturalistic evolution, as well as presenting some counter-arguments against it and for ID.  During the course of our discussion, Pigliucci made some claims which astonished me — especially as arguments coming from a trained philosopher and world-renowned evolutionary theorist. To my surprise, when I articulated the numerous probabilistic hurdles — hurdles which are so pervasive at every level — which Darwinism has to overcome in order to be considered a viable paradigm, he wrote,  No evolutionary biologist I know…actually attaches probabilities to specific evolutionary events of the type you are talking about. There is no way to do that. Similarly, there is no way to attach probabilities to the set of physical laws regulating our universe, for the simple reason that we have no sample population to draw from (which is why typically you estimate probabilities).   Let’s pause here.  One suspects that the key phrase in Pigliucici’s statement is, “of the sort you are talking about.”  Assuming that Jonathan M.’s vague reference to the probabilistic hurdles facing evolution involves the sorts of things ID folks usually say, then Pigliucci’s statement is exactly right.  When an ID proponent starts applying probability language to questions regarding the fine-tuning of the universe or to specific biological structures, it’s a pretty safe bet they are talking through their hats.  But Jonathan M. demurs.  He continues:  This struck me at the time as a very strange argument to be making given the fact that many Darwinists (Dawkins & Futuyma spring to mind) say that the brilliance of Darwin was to reduce the improbability of getting complex, design-like systems. What was the whole point of “Climbing Mount Improbable”? The point was that probability didn’t have to jump up the sheer face of the cliff. It could meander up the gently sloping rear side, in small probability increments. But if we can’t assign probabilities to the events, exactly what has Darwin’s theory done?  The image of probability jumping up the sheer face of a cliff is amusing, but otherwise I fail to understand how any of this relates to what Pigliucci said.  After all, he certainly did not say that you must never, ever use probability language in the context of evolution.  In context, it is perfectly clear what Dawkins and Futuyma have in mind.  If we naively think of every possible genotype having the same probability as every other possible genotype, and then imagine evolution proceeding by selecting genotypes entirely at random, then the probability is vanishingly small that we shall ever find one that produces a functional, complex organism.  But when we factor natural selection into the process it becomes clear that we should not be treating all possible genotypes as equiprobable.  Instead, most of those genotypes have a probability close to zero of ever occurring, because they will be weeded out by selection.  The handful of functional genotypes will be favored by selection.  In this way it is meaningful to say that natural selection changes the probabilities of evolving various structures.  Notice, though, that neither Dawkins nor Futuyma tried to calculate a precise number representing the probability of evolving some particular complex system.  That’s precisely the sort of calculation Pigliucci was describing as impossible.  Jonathan M. now writes:  In response to Massimo, I cited several attempts by Darwinists — many of which feature in the peer-reviewed literature — which attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of the Darwinian mechanism by virtue of probabilistic arguments. I wrote…  He now unloads a long list of examples in which evolutionists employ probabilistic arguments.  Follow the link to the post for the details. He concludes his list with:  But this should be sufficient to refute your [Pigliucci’s] claim that evolutionary biologists are not interested in evaluating probabilistic feasibility.  He now protests that he never got a reply from Pigliucci.  I’m not surprised, since Jonathan M. is completely confused about what the issue is.  Pigliucci certainly never claimed that biologists are not interested in evaluating probabilistic feasibility (whatever that even means).  He said simply that evolutionary biologists do not assign probabilities to specific events in the way that ID folks would like.  For example, Jonathan M. points to a calculation in which biologist Sean Carroll estimated the probability of obtaining the same mutation four times independently in different orders of birds.  In such a narrowly defined situation the problem has more to do with combinatorics than probability, and we can be confident that all of the relevant variables can be approximated with reasonable accuracy.  He also points to a paper by Durrett and Schmidt , in which they evaluated the probability of obtaining two particular mutations in at least one individual of a population.  Once again, in such a narrowly defined situation it is possible to get a grip on all of the relevant variables.  But notice that neither they, nor Carroll, were trying to calculate the probability of evolving a flagellum or anything remotely like that.  In the remaining examples the authors don’t explicitly calculate the probability of anything.  Jonathan M. mentions Dawkins’ “weasel” experiment , presented in his book The Blind Watchmaker. But Dawkins was merely illustrating the power of cumulative selection versus random selection.  He was not calculating probabilities. This paper by Wilf and Ewens , also mentioned in the post, puts some mathematical meat on the bones of Dawkins’ suggestion.  They are working with probabilities only indirectly, and certainly were not trying to assign precise numerical values to specific evolutionary events.  The final reference is to the Avida simulation , but this too had nothing to do with working out the probabilities of specific evolutionary events.  The basic point here is very simple.  A proper probability calculation begins with the definition of a probability space, which means roughly that you must have a grasp on all of the things that might happen and also on the probabilities with which those events occur.  There are many contexts in evolutionary biology where that can be done.  In population genetics, for example, we typically narrow our focus to small numbers of loci over short periods of time, which permits us to get a grip on all of the relevant variables.  This is far different from trying to work out precise probabilities for specific structures that evolved over vast stretches of time.  In such situations we have no hope of getting a grip on everything.  But ID folks forge ahead regardless.  More precisely, since they almost never carry out actual calculations, they simply claim that such things can be done and that when they are the result is bad news for evolution.  Pointing out that this sort of thing is not feasible even in principle, as PIgliucci quite sensibly did, hardly implies that probability does not have useful roles to play in evolutionary theory.

It is such a naked display of ignorance.          #2  Kel   August 16, 2011    Oh good, it’s not just me who finds such arguments as grossly misrepresenting the process. I remember being asked to calculate the probability of some existing gene, as if I had a complete evolutionary history by which to crunch the numbers. Geting so sick of seeing the sharpshooter fallacy expressed as ‘proof’ a designer must have done it.          #3  Massimo Pigliucci   August 16, 2011    Yup, you got it exactly right!          #4  wbk   August 16, 2011    If you calculated the probability of the particular arrangement of grains of sand on the beach at a snapshot in time it would be wildly improbable, and yet there it is (and you get a new wildly improbable arrangement after each wave recedes). Mis-interpreting this kind of small probability is very common. We’re encouraged to interpret small probabilities as evidence that an event is unlikely to occur in some contexts, such as the small probability of a chance match in a DNA test in a criminal case. It’s not so straightforward to recognize the difference between how probability is used in a criminal case and how it’s used here. The key, I think, is that small probabilities are really only meaningful when they’re compared with other alternative outcomes (e.g. the probability of a chance match in a criminal case, vs. the probability of a match if the sample came from the accused).          #5  Mike Gage   August 17, 2011    Has anyone else ever tried to comment at Uncommon Descent? I made some very tame comments just pointing out some simple errors in reasoning and they were never posted. Apparently that is their M.O. They censor all other opinions (except for a few very mild cases so they can deny it) and just have a safe community free of well-argued dissent.          #6  Owlmirror   August 17, 2011    Monsieur Rosenhouse, $$ \frac{(a+b^n)}{n} = x $$, therefore, God exists!  Reply!          #7  James Thompson   August 17, 2011    Do you think that the arguments would be more accessible and clear if they focused on relative probability (or likelihood ratios?) rather than absolute probability? Evolution is complex, and there are many factors that are difficult to estimate. However, if one is clever about the way that comparisons are made, many of those factors will cancel out.          #8  Koray   August 17, 2011    No surprise there, Jason. You wrote a book on how people fail to grok probability theory after all.          #9  craig schwartz   August 17, 2011    Given the typical human ejaculate contains some hundred of millions of sperm, and give the number of chance meetings and couplings of JonathanMs’ parents, and grandparents, and along the whole chain of his ancestry, the probability of JonathanM existing at all is vanishingly small. Therefore, he doesn’t (exist).          #10  Bob O'H   August 17, 2011    I’m not going to bother to set craig schwartz straight because (a) by the same argument he doesn’t exist either, and (b) I don’t exist.  The Lord, however, does exist – or so it seems to me. Perhaps you’d like to sing to him. He likes that. Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.          #11  Richard Wein   August 17, 2011    To calculate a probability (or any other quantity relating to a real process) we need to be able to abstract the real, complex process down to a relatively simple model which roughly preserves the quantity that we’re interested in. This isn’t always possible.  Nilsson and Pelger did it (arguably) for the evolution of an eye, by abstracting the eye down to its most significant elements, and using a crude general model for estimating the time needed for each small change. (They estimated an expected time rather than a probability, but the two are closely related.) But note that they were showing the existence of an evolutionary scenario that rendered the evolution of that trait probable. It would be much harder to show the non-existence of any such scenario, which is what the creationist is trying to do.          #12  JimR   August 17, 2011    Given that evolution consists of small incremental changes, then trying to apply probability as if each event is independent gives you the (1/quazillion)^wayupthere kind of calculations. This model is completely wrong. Bayes theorem is the only accurate model basis where each step is preconditioned on the prior one. With simultaneous combinations in the 10^? occurring and infeasible ones dropping out, the calculation at each step is 10^?/quazillion), a much lower, but still unknown probability. Also there is not just one selection, but multiple surviving, all of which may be equally feasible. AND most likely there are many replicates of each of the multiple lines. Catastrophic events may weed some of these lines. The many lines and many reps is especially true in the evolutionary changes in unicellular organisms. It becomes somewhat narrower as the complexity of the organism advances. So the timeline for advantageous changes in the unicellular evolution is short compared to the timeline for more complex lines. Yet the time existed. I’m sorry for folks that cannot imagine these vast populations changing over time. There is no end goal except survival at each step. Natural Selection is a scary, but fascinating process. I’m glad I made it to see the advances made up to now. I wonder where life forms will be 10^n years from now.          #13  TomS   August 17, 2011    I like to calculate, using the same methodology, the probability that an intelligent designer would design things the way they are.  An intelligent designer, presumably, can do more things than can be done by “naturalistic processes”.  The probability that something happens is the number of favorable cases divided by the number of possible cases. Intelligent design means that the denominator, the number of possible cases, is greater than the number of possible cases with naturalistic processes.  This means that, no matter how small the probability is that naturalistic processes would result in such-and-such, the probability is smaller that an intelligent designer would do it.  Things would change, to be sure, if someone would specify what sorts of things intelligent designers would not, or could not, do.          #14  Dunc   August 17, 2011    To take a slightly different tack, there’s also the question of whether a combination with an apparently vanishingly low probability actually [i]is[/i] all that improbable once you’re dealing with a beaker the size of a planet over timescales of hundreds of millions of years… Sure, the question is fundamentally “not even wrong”, but even granting these absurd premises for the sake of argument, I’m still not convinced.          #15  NJ   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H @ 10:  I’m not going to bother to set craig schwartz straight because (a) by the same argument he doesn’t exist either, and (b) I don’t exist.  That whooshing sound you heard was the point of his post going right by you.          #16  Tommy Holland   August 17, 2011    Reminds me of the absurd probability calculations that evangelists make to demonstrate how unlikely it would be for a man named Jesus to fulfill an Old Testament prophecy, let alone “hundreds” of them.  They’re careful to list the absurdly large numbers, but never show how those numbers were calculated.          #17  Lenoxus   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H:  The Lord, however, does exist – or so it seems to me. Perhaps you’d like to sing to him. He likes that. Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  That’s an… oddly constrained description. Is “the Lord” the name of one of your pets, unable to literally say “that pleases me” but able to wag its tail or rub its face against you?  Or perhaps you are being extremely euphemistic, and “the Lord” is your nickname for a lover? Nothing wrong with that, of course. It’s just that I can’t help but see “if you get my drift” after “he acts in a way I interpret to mean he likes it”.  If “the Lord” is God, I wonder why his tastes have changed. Didn’t the smell of burning ox flesh used to please his nostrils? But now he’s all about the music. An improvent, I suppose.          #18  TomS   August 17, 2011    @craig schwartz #9:  I like that version of the probability argument, too.  The way I prefer to calculate it is:  First of all, excluding intermarriage, a person has 2 parents, 4 grandparents, and 8 grandparents, so let’s assume distinct 10 ancestors per generation in the 19th century and earlier; and three generations per century. That means 30 ancestors per century. If we go back 1000 years, that means about 300 ancestors.  And in those days, a lot of children died before reaching maturity, something like 50%. (We can reduce that number significantly by considering the probability that ancestor X and ancestor Y met and became the parents of your ancestor Z.)  So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^900 = 1 / 10^900.          #19  dean   August 17, 2011    “the Heritage Foundation (an ultra-right-wing political think tank) ”  It’s not a think tank: it’s a dogma tank.          #20  eric   August 17, 2011    there’s also the question of whether a combination with an apparently vanishingly low probability actually [i]is[/i] all that improbable  Right.  As several posters have pointed out, highly improbable things happen all the time.  In fact, in any circumstance where a large number of different things could happen, there is a near-100% chance that something highly improbable will happen. 🙂  Have a creo tell you what limit makes some event too improbable to happen (i.e., 1 in 10^X).  Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to 1.3*X (rounding up), and you’ll create an event that is less probable than their limit.          #21  Raging Bee   August 17, 2011    IF you want to disprove evolution using probability, you have to demonstrate that the creation of all life on Earth as we see it by a “Designer” is MORE probable than the creation of such life through evolution.  So how would we do that?  First, of course, we have to make some assumptions about the Designer: who/what is he/she/it/they?  And since the overwhelming majority of creationists clearly assume it’s the God of the Bible, we’ll go with that assumption: Go — excuse me, The Designer — is a supernatural being of literally infinite power and knowledge.  Next step: what is the range of possible universes this esigner can create?  Answer: an INFINITE range — an all-powerful Go — Designer — can create anything he’s capable of imagining, which, for a being of infinite intelligence, is an infinite range.  So what’s the probability of the Designer creating this particular Universe, with this particular set of life-forms, out of the literally infinite range of possibile universes he could have created?  Why, that would be one in infinity — which is to say zero.  Not “essentially zero,” mind you, not “vanishingly small,” not “close” to zero, but really, truly, exactly, LITERALLY zero point zero zero zip zilch nada buggerall fuggedaboutit.  Creationists, please reply.          #22  Dr. I. Needtob Athe   August 17, 2011    When someone argues that evolution is too improbable to be true, one might respond in this fashion:  “Think about the improbability that you were born. It required that your two parents met each other and mated at the exact time that they did (else your brother or sister would have been born instead), and that, in turn, required that your four grandparents met each other and mated at the exact time that they did so that your parents existed in the first place, which required that your eight great-grandparents all met and mated at the exact time that they did, and so on, all the way back to the beginning of mankind. Therefore, using your logic, I just proved that you don’t exist.”          #23  Vicki   August 17, 2011    Bob O’H: I trust there’s enough fish to keep the Lord happy. (Lenoxus: It’s a literary allusion.)  This is the point at which I want to tell the anti-evolutionists that the probability of humans having evolved is 1, because it has happened in every known universe. I don’t believe this, or rather I don’t think it’s meaningful, but I also think it’s sounder than their numbers, because it’s based on observed facts, namely, we exist.          #24  TomS   August 17, 2011    @Raging Bee #21:  I agree fully with you. I was being a little more conservative, but I agree that the probability that an omnipotent being would create such-and-such is zero .  But I would note that mathematicians do not equate “probability zero” to “impossible”. For example, a real number is rational with probability zero.  BTW, I made a mistake in the final calculations of my post #18. It should read:  So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^90 = 1 / 10^90.          #25  Jeff Sherry   August 17, 2011    Owlmirror, wasn’t that argument used in Catherine the Greats court to dismiss a french philosopher?          #26  Ken sinisi   August 17, 2011    Doesn’t the seemingly endless debate of evolution vs. creationism, when broken down to it’s simplest form, become a debate of the logical vs. the illogical? Why would one continually try to explain and reason with another who insists that a wheel is square, and not round? Prove to me that the wheel is round. I say it’s square. A lesson in futility.          #27  stevev   August 17, 2011    So the probability that all of your ancestors survived to maturity to become your ancestor is something like (0.5)^(300), approximately (0.1)^900 = 1 / 10^900.  But all of your ancestors DID survive to maturity (or you wouldn’t be here) so the probability is 1.          #28  Kel   August 17, 2011    Plantinga’s EAAN is a perfect example of armchair philosophy, where really such an approach shows moore the limitation of the philosopher than of the process itself. Fodor’s a priori argument against natural selection another. It’s interesting reading about experiment after experiment that illustrates natural selection so well, only to find talking about counterfactuals that rule out ‘selection for’. In defence of philosophers, many rushed to point out precisely where Fodor was mistaken, just as many have argued against Plantinga. But what good does either argument do for the practice of biology? Does either argument make predictions about the phenomena observed? Are they empirically falsifiable? If not, what good are they?          #29  Jud   August 17, 2011    Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  Dude, He’s gonna kill you.  Kinda screws up your “argument” (fond hope, really).          #30  Kel   August 17, 2011    Whoops, that last comment was meant to go in a different thread. My mistake.          #31  Jud   August 17, 2011    Or at least he acts in a way which I interpret to mean he likes it.  Dude, He’s gonna kill you.  Kinda screws up your “argument” (fond hope, really).          #32  Jud   August 17, 2011    One typical creationist error is to consider the actual outcome as the only “right” outcome, and treat one over number-of-possible-outcomes as the relevant probability.  This is what’s behind the argument that the probability you exist is infinitesimal, or the grains-of-sand example in #4.  Sean B. Carroll pointed out in one of his books that if the creationist view were correct, no one would win the (Powerball) lottery for a couple million years – the odds of a particular player winning are about 200 million to 1, and there are two drawings per week, so about 100 per year.  But someone wins the lottery every couple of weeks, so that’s obviously not the correct calculation.  The correct calculation is the one that gives the odds of *anyone* winning the lottery, just as the correct evolutionary calculation is not the odds of one specific mutation, but of *any* mutation occurring that allows the organism to survive and reproduce.  (Those odds are then of course modified by selection in some cases, and go to fixation through genetic drift in other cases.)          #33  Matt G   August 17, 2011    I came up with an analogy.  Imagine playing bridge and having all four players dealt all the cards in a suit.  The probability of being dealt those hands is minuscule, yet the probability of being dealt ANY given set of hands is just as minuscule.          #34  Face   August 18, 2011    denemek lazım kanka denemekden zarar gelmez          #35  Face   August 18, 2011    reis diyosa haklıdır          #36  Kel   August 18, 2011    Matt G, the problem with that analogy is that the creationists will agree that each hand is equally improbable – but that you’ve gotten a royal flush. While any hand is equally improbable, the quality of the hand varies in probability.  That said, they leave the most crucial element out – selection. If you return individual cards and keep good ones, gradually you’ll get a better and better hand. Yes, a royal flush is really improbable, but you’re going to get one so much quicker by gradually mutating a hand than you are doing it from scratch. By assigning those a priori improbabilities, they misrepresent the process, and thus the numbers are useless.          #37  Remo   August 18, 2011    If the universe is infinite (which it may well be) then regardless of its improbability, life will have arisen in an infinite number of locations.  QED          #38  Owlmirror   August 18, 2011    Owlmirror, wasn’t that argument used in Catherine the Greats court to dismiss a french philosopher?  Actually, it is almost certainly apocryphal .  But I am sure that Jason knows of the anecdote, and, I hope, finds the reference appropriately amusing.          #39  TomS   August 18, 2011    As far as the “Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism”, I like to transpose all of the arguments by the evolution-deniers into arguments where “evolution” is replaced by “reproduction”. It’s fascinating just how many of the arguments for creationism/intelligent design turn out to be at least as good (if not better!) arguments for Scientific Storkism.  For example, let us suppose that our brains are the product of naturalistic processes of reproduction and development. How, then, can we trust out thoughts?  BTW, let us suppose that our thoughts are, rather, just implanted in our brains by some “intelligent designer”. Does that make them any more reliable? After all, this is the same “intelligent designer” who designed the universe with the false appearance of life being related by billions of years of common descent. Would you trust a used-car salesman who told you that the used car only had the appearance of being 20 years old with 500,000 miles on it – it’s “really” last year’s model? (And the used-car salesman is only off by a factor of 10 or 100 – not a factor of a million or so, like “young earth creationism”.)          #40  anthrosciguy   August 18, 2011    One problem pseudoscientists face is that they shortcut from speculation to the end.  While it’s possible that a biologist thinking about evolution (it would have to be sometime back when we didn’t have anywhere near as much info as we do now) might make a probalistic back of the envelope calculation to see if a completely random process — random from start to finish — could account for what we see in nature.  They’d see that it doesn’t, and the reaction would be that they needed to do more thinking about what could account for this.  And they did that and we’ve got a very sound idea of how this happens.  The pseudoscientist typically takes the first speculation and that’s it: they treat it as the finished product and it becomes, in their minds, data.  You see this sort of short circuiting from speculation to “data” over and over in virtually all types of pseudoscience and pseudohistory.          #41  Matt G   August 18, 2011    Kel-  I use that bridge analogy to counter the “evolution is like a tornado going through a junkyard and assembling a 747” argument.  Any number of organisms COULD have evolved, but a tiny subset actually did.  You extension of my analogy is a lot like Dawkin’s “Methinks it is like a weasel” analogy which illustrates how cycles of (random) mutation and (non-random) selection can generate something non-random.          #42  Kel   August 18, 2011    Matt G, indeed. It’s a really good analogy, so much so that creationists still try their damn hardest to miss the point and take the analogy for what it wasn’t. Though it’s even more amazing that creationists so fundamentally misunderstand how evolution works that any talk of probability that they’re going to take any explanation of improbability as being monkeys on typewriters producing Shakespeare.          #43  Pragmatist   August 18, 2011    All of these type of Creationist arguments really are variations on this question: “It works in practice, but can they prove it works in theory?” The absurdity of that is all that is needed to rebut them.          #44  shekhar   August 19, 2011    It is very wonderfull center          #45  John K.   August 19, 2011    Probability is just a way to manage the unknown.  The big problem in  the probability argument here is taking known factors and treating them as if they were unknown.  A set of parents have 3 daughters.  What are the chances the next child they have will be female?  1 in 2 of course.  Why not 1 in 16?  Because the first 3 children have KNOWN genders.  Lottery numbers are difficult to pick because of the many unknown factors.  If the trajectories of all the balls are accurately traced (a difficult task to be sure) the correct numbers could be picked every time.  When something happens that is “highly improbable” to you, it is more a reflection how much of the process was unknown to you.  For creationists that deliberately refuse to consider evidence, it is natural that they think the probability is very low.  Their understanding is abysmally poor.          #46  Lenoxus   August 20, 2011    Regarding the EAN: on top of everything else, it seems that the EAN requires a premise like “It is true that our minds are rational and our thinking process can be trusted to be accurate.” For a premise in a logical argument, sn’t that extremely problematic? How do we know that our minds aren’t faulty?  In fact, it’s worse than that, because we know, from thousands of experiments, the precise ways our minds get fooled; we call them “cognitive biases”. So we actually have positive evidence that if our minds are the product of an omnipotent designer, she wanted them to be irrational.          #47  rob   August 23, 2011    @Remo:  “It is known that there are an infinte number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely products of a deranged imagination.”          #48  Jeff   August 28, 2011    He just shrugged and went on to the next question.  This is what they do. A couple of years ago, I attended a talk given by a YEC who had just bamboozled Harvard into giving him a PhD in Cell Biology. It was sponsored by an evangelical church, but there were a number of scientists and science-oriented people in attendance, including a real microbiologist, and they hammered away at him during the Q&A. Each time he was backed into a corner, made to admit he didn’t understand or was ignorant of the science, he just dropped the issue in question and moved on.  For these people, it has absolutely nothing to do with apprehending objective reality. It’s entirely about getting the ontological security blanket for the few brief decades they’re here – and for many (I contend it’s most), fantasizing about our eternal torment being their half-time entertainment in the afterlife.          #49  Tomato Addict   September 8, 2011    @#7: Michael Behe’s “Complex Specified Information” is a likelihood ratio (sort of), but it fails for the same reason that Jason wrote about. CSI calculates the likelihood of jumping up the cliff, a “big jump” null hypothesis, and claims it is impossible. The possibility of gradual selection, or going up the gradual slope, is not considered, nor it is acknowledged that it isn’t possible to calculate such a number.          #50  Paul   November 2, 2011    Fantastic post I very much enjoyed it, keep up the good work.          #51  Emil Sugak   November 30, 2011    Throughout history man has taken very good records of big events thats a fact. So to say evolution is true,Then why is it not recorded. I mean man has been around thousands of years and there is not one record of one animal evolving from one to another or one evolving to man. Even if something as far fetched as that happened it would have made headline news, thats also a fact. So if we supposedly evolved from monkeys or apes why then are they still here and why are they not evolving now,Even if they were scientists would be recording it and that would also make headline news, also a fact.So now scientists are again trying to assume that evolution happens rapidly,Even you should be able to laugh yourself silly on that one. For everything that happens there is proof,another fact and you know that also. Bottom line is all science is trying to assume that evolution is true when in fact it is not and not even close to being true. All that happens all around the world is everything all living things great and small adapt to the environment they are living in. When all evolution theories are proven wrong so far I cannot wait to hear what the next assumption will be, Should be a good one.          #52  Wow   November 30, 2011    > So to say evolution is true,Then why is it not recorded.  It is.  The evolution of viral resistance is a record of evolution, for example.  > and there is not one record of one animal evolving from one to another  See above.  > or one evolving to man  It isn’t magic. No “Size of an Elephant!” fwoosh.  You’re still beholden to the childish wish fulfilment.  Have a look at the foetus development. There’s a tadpole. There’s a lizard. Then there’s a baby. Then there’s a child. Then there’s an adult.  Those changes are so much part of every day, that transformation from tadpole to human doesn’t make the news because it is so commonplace.  > So now scientists are again trying to assume that evolution happens rapidly  You’re proof that devolution happens rapidly.  I guess you just invest whatever nonsense you believe is nonsense and paste it over what you’re told about science so you don’t have to think. How rapid is “rapid” in this case?  > Bottom line is all science is trying to assume that evolution is true when in fact it is not and not even close to being true  Bottom line: what is going on, then?          #53  Eric   March 15, 2012    The probability argument is just one. Evolutionists also have to bear the burden of explaining how naturalistic processes somehow broke some very basic laws of nature in order for life to be created, i.e. the law of biogenesis and the laws of thermodynamics. I find it funny that a group that is so set on evidence being the only criteria for rational belief in something would be quite content with, “We don’t know.”, regarding the theory of evolution.          #54  Wow   March 15, 2012    “i.e. the law of biogenesis and the laws of thermodynamics”  Nope, biogenesis doesn’t disobey the laws of thermodynamics.  They turn high-energy, low-entropy sunlight at a spectrum of 6000K and turn it into low-energy, high-entropy thermal energy at a spectrum of ~300K.  Nothing broken there.  I find it funny when people find it funny when they promote their ignorance of science onto others and think it proves these others are wrong.       New comments have been disabled.

Chromosomes are microscopically small,  rod-shaped structures which carry the genes. Within the chromosomes is an even  smaller structure called DNA. This is one of the most important chemical  substances in the human body -- or in any other living thing. Increasing scientific understanding of DNA  molecules has revealed enormous problems for materialism.    DNA is a super-molecule which stores coded hereditary  information. It consists of two long "chains" of chemical "building blocks"  paired together. In humans, the strands of DNA are almost 2 yards long, yet less  than a trillionth of an inch thick.    In function, DNA is somewhat like a computer program on a  floppy disk. It stores and transfers encoded information and instructions. It is  said that the DNA of a human stores enough information code to fill 1,000 books -- each with 500 pages of very small, closely-printed type. The DNA code  produces a product far more sophisticated than that of any computer. Amazingly,  this enormous set of instructions fits with ease within a single cell and  routinely directs the formation of entire adult humans, starting with just a  single fertilized egg. Even the DNA of a bacterium is highly complex, containing  at least 3 million units, all aligned in a very precise, meaningful  sequence.    DNA and the molecules that surround it form a truly superb  mechanism -- a miniaturized marvel. the information is so compactly stored that  the amount of DNA necessary to code all the people living on our planet might  fit into a space no larger than an asprin tablet!    Many scientists are convinced that cells containing such a  complex code and such intricate chemistry could never have come into being by  pure, undirected chemistry. No matter how chemicals are mixed, they do not create DNA spirals or any intelligent code whatsoever. Only DNA reproduces DNA.    Two well known scientists calculated the odds of life forming  by natural processes. They estimated that there is less than 1 chance in 10 to  the 40,000power that life could have originated by random trials. 10 to the  40,000power is a 1 with 40,000 zeros after it!    - "...life cannot have had a random beginning...The trouble is  that there are about two thousand enzymes, and the chance of obtaining them all  in a random trial is only one part in 10 to the 40,000power, an outrageously  small probability that could not be faced even if the whole universe consisted  of organic soup. If one is not prejudiced either by social beliefs or by a  scientific training into the conviction that life originated on the Earth, this simple calculation  wipes the idea entirely out of court....The enormous information content of even  the simplest living systems...cannot in our view be generated by what are often  called "natural" processes...For life to have originated on the Earth it would  be necessary that quite explicit instruction should have been provided for its  assembly...There is no way in which we can expect to avoid the need for  information, no way in which we can simply get by with a bigger and better  organic soup, as we ourselves hoped might be possible a year or two ago."    Fred Hoyle and N. Chandra Wickramasinghe,  Evolution from  Space [Aldine House, 33 Welbeck Street ,  London W1M 8LX:  J.M. Dent & Sons, 1981), p. 148, 24,150,30,31).    How can one gain some conception of the size of such a huge  number? According to most Evolutionists, the universe is less than 30 billion  years old -- and there are fewer than 10 to the 18th Power seconds in 30 billion  years. So, even if nature could somehow have produced trillions of genetic code  combinations every second for 30 billion years, the probabilities against  producing the simplest one-celled animal by trial and error would still be  inconceivably immense! In other words, probabilities greatly favor those that  believe an intelligent designer was responsible for originating even the  simplest DNA molecules.    Chemist Dr. Grebe: "That organic evolution could account for  the complex forms of life in the past and the present has long since been  abandoned by men who grasp the importance of the DNA genetic code."    Researcher and mathematician I.L Cohen: "At that moment, when  the DNA/RNA system became understood, the debate between Evolutionists and  Creationists should have come to a screeching halt...the implications of the  DNA/RNA were obvious and clear....Mathematically speaking, based on probability  concepts, there is no possibility that Evolution vs the mechanism that created  the approximately 6,000,000 species of plants and animals we recognize  today."    Evolutionist Michael Denton: "The complexity of the simplest  known type of cell is so great that it is impossible to accept that such an  object could have been thrown together suddenly by some kind of freakish, vastly  improbable, event. Such an occurrence would be indistinguishable from a  miracle."    Famed researcher Sir Fred Hoyle is in agreement with  Creationists on this point. He has reportedly said that supposing the first cell  originated by chance is like believing "a tornado sweeping through a junk yard  might assemble a Boeng 747 from the materials therein."    Many, if not most, origin-of-life researchers now agree with  Hoyle: Life could not have originated by chance or by any known natural  processes. many Evolutionists are now searching for some theoretical force  within matter which might push matter toward the assembly of greater complexity.  Most Creationists believe this is doomed to failure, since it contradicts the  2nd Law of Thermodynamics.    It is important to note that the information written on DNA  molecules is not produced by any known natural interaction of matter. Matter and  molecules have no innate intelligence, allowing self organization into codes.  There are no know n physical laws which give molecules a natural tendency to  arrange themselves into such coded structures.    Like a computer disk, DNA has no intelligence. The complex,  purposeful codes of this "master program" could have only originated outside  itself. In the case of a computer program, the original codes were put there by  an intelligent being, a programmer. Likewise, for DNA, it seems clear that  intelligence must have come first, before the existence of DNA. Statistically,  the odds are enormously in favor of that theory. DNA bears the marks of  intelligent manufacture.    Dr Wilder-Smith is an honored scientist who is certainly  well-informed on modern biology and biochemistry. What is his considered opinion  as to the source of the DNA codes found in each wondrous plant and animal?  "...an attempt to explain the formation of the genetic code from the chemical  components of DNA...is comparable to the assumption that the text of a book  originates from the paper molecules on which the sentences appear, and not from  any external source of information." " As a scientist, I am convinced that the  pure chemistry of a cell is not enough to explain the workings of a cell,  although the workings are chemical. The chemical workings of the cell are  controlled by information which does not reside in the atoms and molecules of  that cell. There is an author which transcends the material and the matter of  which these strands are made. The author first of all conceived the information  necessary to make a cell, then wrote it down, and then fixed it in a mechanism  of reading it and realizing it in practice -- so that the cell builds itself  from the information..."    One need only look carefully at any living creature to gain  some concept of their enormous complexity. If you have a pet, consider the  complexities that must be involved -- enabling that "package of matter" to move  about, play, remember, show signs of affection, eat, and reproduce!    If that is not enough to boggle your mind, imagine being given  the task of constructing a similar living pet from carbon, calcium, hydrogen,  oxygen, etc. -- the animal's basic constituent parts.    If you have ever held a beloved pet in your hands, completely  limp and dead, you may have some comprehension of the helplessness of even the  most intelligent and sophisticated scientist when it comes to the overwhelming  problem of trying to create life.    In contrast, the natural world does not have the advantages  people bring to the problem. In nature, there are only matter, energy, time,  chance and the physical laws -- no guiding force, no purpose, and no goal.    Yet, even with all of modern man's accumulated knowledge,  advanced tools, and experience, we are still absolutely overwhelmed at the  complexities. This is despite the fact that we are certainly not starting from  absolute zero in this problem, for there are millions of actual living examples  of life to scrutinize.    THE INCREDIBLE COMPLEXITY OF MAN    All living things are extremely complex, even the tiniest  single-celled animals and bacteria. However, none surpasses the overall  complexity of the human being. Not only is each person constructed of trillions  of molecules and cells, but the human brain alone is filled with billions of  cells forming trillions of trillions of connections. The design of the human  brain is truly awesome and beyond our understanding. Every cubic inch of the  human brain contains at least 100 million nerve cells interconnected by 10  thousand miles of fibers.    It has been said that man's 3 pound brain is the most complex  and orderly arrangement of matter in the entire universe! Far more complicated  than any computer, the human brain is capable of storing and creatively  manipulating seemingly infinite amounts of information. Its capabilities and  potential stagger the imagination. The more we use it, the better it  becomes.    The brain capabilities of even the smallest insects are  mind-boggling. The tiny speck of a brain found in a little ant, butterfly or bee  enable them not only to see, smell, taste and move, but even to fly with great  precision. Butterflies routinely navigate enormous distances. Bees and ants  carry on complex social organizations, building projects, and communications.  These miniature brains put our computers and avionics to shame, in  comparison.    The marvels of the bodies of both animals and man are evidently  endless. Dr. A.E. Wilder-Smith makes this thought-provoking and humbling  statement:    "When one considers that the entire chemical information to  construct a man, elephant, frog or an orchid was compressed into two minuscule  reproductive cells (sperm and egg nuclei), one can only be astounded. In  addition to this, all the information is available on the genes to repair the  body (not only to construct it) when it is injured. If one were to request an  engineer to accomplish this feat of information miniaturization, one would be  considered fit for the psychiatric clinic."    It is certainly true that a machine carefully made by a  craftsman reflects the existence of it's creator. It would be foolish to suggest  that time and chance could make a typewriter or a microwave oven, or that the  individual parts could form themselves into these complex mechanisms due to the  physical properties of matter. Yet, life is far, far more complex than any  man-made machine.    The more scientists study life, the more they become deeply  impressed. Nature is full of intricate design and beauty. In contrast to  man-made objects, which look increasingly crude in finish and detail the closer  they are viewed (i.e., through powerful microscopes), the closer life is  examined the more complex and wondrous it appears.    Planet Earth is filled with myriad forms of life, each with  enormous levels of complexity. Materialists believe life in all its amazing  forms consist merely of atoms and molecules. They believe these atoms and  molecules formed themselves into millions of intricate animals and plants. This  view was born out of an earlier, more naive period in science when the extreme  complexity of living systems was not understood. Even if nature could build the  necessary proteins and enzymes, it is far from producing life. There is an  enormous difference between producing a building block and producing a fully  operating and serviced 100-story skyscraper from those building blocks.  Buildings require builders; programs require programmers.    Today, most scientists are convinced that life could never have  come into being without some form of highly intelligent and powerful  designer.    THE BOTTOM LINE on the origin of life    - During all recorded human history, there has never been a  substantiated case of a living thing being produced from anything other than  another living thing.    - As yet, evolutionism has not produced a scientifically  credible explanation for the origin of such immense complexities as DNA, the  human brain, and many elements of the cosmos.    - It is highly premature for materialists to claim that all  living things evolved into existence, when science has yet to discover how even  one protein molecule could actually have come into existence by natural  processes.    - there is no scientific proof that life did (or ever could)  evolve into existence from non-living matter. Further, there is substantial  evidence that spontaneous generation is impossible. Only DNA is known to produce  DNA. No chemical interaction of molecules has even come close to producing this  ultra-complex code which is so essential to all known life.    However what do your scientific minds have to say about the above?          1             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Moontanman    2019            Moontanman    2019    SuperNerd       Senior Members    2019   10255 posts   Location:  South Eastern North Carolina              Posted July 22, 2012         http://crl.i8.com/Evolution/Dna.html        DNA Molecules and the Odds Against Evolution  Within each cell there is an area called the nucleus which  contains the all-important chromosomes.

We know that amino acids are the building blocks of enzymes, so what part of the probability that you give is the chance of obtaining the required amino acids for those enzymes?      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 StringJunky    1640            StringJunky    1640    Genius       Senior Members    1640   7489 posts   Location:  UK              Posted July 22, 2012        The researchers probably calculated the odds for a limited set of molecules to combine to the desired configurations.

This is evidenced by the fact that so far we haven't found any except here on earth.  I would say we haven't looked and that we don't have many places to look. The only planets in the Sun's habitable zone are Venus, Earth, and Mars. There's a lot more to habitability than merely being in a star's habitable zone. Venus has too thick an atmosphere. Mars, too thin. Neither Venus nor Mars has an active plate tectonics system. Mars might have been habitable long ago, and Mars does show some signs of having borne life long ago. It shows some signs that it still bears life right now. We do see life on the one planet that is habitable, and that life originated very shortly after conditions became hospitable for life. Judging from a sample size of one, maybe two, (which is all we've got), it appears that primitive life is very likely to arise if conditions are right. That said, judging from a small sample size is always an iffy proposition. We need more data.

There is probably no other statement which is a better indication that the arguer doesn't understand evolution. Chance certainly plays a large part in evolution, but this argument completely ignores the fundamental role of natural selection, and selection is the very opposite of chance. Chance, in the form of mutations, provides genetic variation, which is the raw material that natural selection has to work with. From there, natural selection sorts out certain variations. Those variations which give greater reproductive success to their possessors (and chance ensures that such beneficial mutations will be inevitable) are retained, and less successful variations are weeded out. When the environment changes, or when organisms move to a different environment, different variations are selected, leading eventually to different species. Harmful mutations usually die out quickly, so they don't interfere with the process of beneficial mutations accumulating.    Nor is abiogenesis (the origin of the first life) due purely to chance. Atoms and molecules arrange themselves not purely randomly, but according to their chemical properties. In the case of carbon atoms especially, this means complex molecules are sure to form spontaneously, and these complex molecules can influence each other to create even more complex molecules. Once a molecule forms that is approximately self-replicating, natural selection will guide the formation of ever more efficient replicators. The first self-replicating object didn't need to be as complex as a modern cell or even a strand of DNA. Some self-replicating molecules are not really all that complex (as organic molecules go).    Some people still argue that it is wildly improbable for a given self-replicating molecule to form at a given point (although they usually don't state the "givens," but leave them implicit in their calculations). This is true, but there were oceans of molecules working on the problem, and no one knows how many possible self-replicating molecules could have served as the first one. A calculation of the odds of abiogenesis is worthless unless it recognizes the immense range of starting materials that the first replicator might have formed from, the probably innumerable different forms that the first replicator might have taken, and the fact that much of the construction of the replicating molecule would have been non-random to start with.    (One should also note that the theory of evolution doesn't depend on how the first life began. The truth or falsity of any theory of abiogenesis wouldn't affect evolution in the least.)        In short, life does not evolve by chance alone, nor does the theory of evolution have anything to do with how life began.  That's a completely different theory.          3             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Alan McDougall    41            Alan McDougall    41    Quark       Senior Members    41   769 posts   Location:  South Africa Johannesburg/Sunninghill              Posted July 23, 2012  (edited)       The likelihood that you were born faces such vanishingly small odds as to be impossible.

Of the six five billion people you are the offspring of only two uniquepersons, namely your mom and dad. Of your mom's some twenty thousand eggs, youarose from just one of them. Out of your dads half billion or so sperm cells,only one reached that specific egg to create the unique being that you are. Noone else has or will ever have your exact DNA code.    There has never been someone exactly like you in all creation going backfifteen or so billion years namely, the estimated age of the universe. In alleternities going into the infinite future there will never be another exactlylike you.    Lastly, you were lucky enough to come into existence in a universe beautifullybalanced to harbour human and other life.    So the question begs, are you a fluke? on the other hand, the work of a mind ofunimaginable omniscience?     http://www.talkorigi...onceptions.html        In short, life does not evolve by chance alone, nor does the theory of evolution have anything to do with how life began.

Nobody says that abiogenesis and evolution happen purely by chance.      Rocks to living things in such a relatively short time, how?  That's a good question. There are lots of candidates, but finding evidence to test them is hard. Such evidence would require seeing signs of very small organisms preserved for about four billion years.

"We don't have a very good  definitionof life ," said researcher Christopher Voigt of the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco, who works on syntheticbiology . "It's a very abstract thing, what we call life, and at whatpoint we say something doesn't have the necessary components versus it does, itjust becomes way too murky."     The question of what constitutes life has dogged scientists since the early days.        Working toward a definition     Aristotle was the first to attempt todefine life, and his proposal boils down to life being something that grows andmaintains itself (he called this "nutrition"), and reproduces.        In 1944, Austrian physicist Erwin  Schrödinger defined life as that which resists decaying to disorder and  equilibrium. This definition relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which  states that closed systems will naturally gain entropy, or disorder, over time.      Essentially, like a teenager's room, without any help from mom, it will  inevitably get messier. But by taking in nutrients and metabolizing them,  living things can work against this trend.        However, this definition would mean that  crystals, which take in energy and create order when they form elaborate  lattices of particles, count as life.        This is the problem with most proposed  definitions of life: They tend of have loopholes.        For example, some have proposed that life  is that which can reproduce itself. However, that definition would exclude  mules, which are born sterile, and would include nonliving things like fire.        Others have suggested that life is  something that can metabolize — that is, take in energy to move or grow, and  release waste — but many nonliving things, like cars, can do that.        "Life, because it is such a complex  system of things with so many interacting parts , each of which is essential, it'sreally tough to make a definition," said biochemist David Deamer of theUniversity of California, Santa Cruz.        Despite the difficulty of pinning down  life, some scientists aren't content to give up, saying a working definition of  life is necessary if we are to identify living things beyond Earth. In that  case, the adage, "You'll know it when you see it" just doesn't cut  it.    S ome Nobel prize winners who believe in some sort of intelligent underpinning reality.

My Reflections on the Intelligent Design Debate    I believe in evolution.  I believe in intelligent design.  I’m not sure what my opinion is of macro-evolution and I’m pretty sure I’m not a young-earther in the traditional sense, but there are certainly others who share my opinion on both of these issues (See peer reviewed article links & the dissent from darwin as well as the article by Stephen Meyer, which is an incredible article).  I believe that textbooks should at least teach the controversy for greater public awareness of the issue.  Does intelligent it belong in a science textbook?  Does intelligent design belong in the science classroom?  I’m not entirely sure.  Perhaps its more of a civics, government, or history issue rather than a science one.  However, it seems that science looses even more if its not included in a scientific context (i.e. they have to re-clarify and re-explain their approach or position on intelligent design at a later date).  The current policy seems to be one of avoidance of conflict and controversy….but thats just an elephant in the room.

The only planets in the Sun's habitable zone are Venus, Earth, and Mars. There's a lot more to habitability than merely being in a star's habitable zone. Venus has too thick an atmosphere. Mars, too thin. Neither Venus nor Mars has an active plate tectonics system. Mars might have been habitable long ago, and Mars does show some signs of having borne life long ago. It shows some signs that it still bears life right now. We do see life on the one planet that is habitable, and that life originated very shortly after conditions became hospitable for life. Judging from a sample size of one, maybe two, (which is all we've got), it appears that primitive life is very likely to arise if conditions are right. That said, judging from a small sample size is always an iffy proposition. We need more data.    I agree your facts, to go further means opinion and even speculation. So here are some of my thoughts (for what they are worth ). It seems to me that once primitive life starts then at some stage we can expect evolution to kick in with a vengeance. Once a life form makes it way forward by intelligence then in evolutionary terms the ability to communicate and record rapidly will soon follow. Under this scenario if life exists throughout the universe it should become intelligent life and there is no reason to think we would be the most advanced or the most inquisitive. In other words some of "them" may have been looking for us for light years and as I understand it we have been looking for signals for a long time without result.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Alan McDougall    41            Alan McDougall    41    Quark       Senior Members    41   769 posts   Location:  South Africa Johannesburg/Sunninghill              Posted July 23, 2012  (edited)       The problem of origin of life is unsolvable by the positivism of science and hence the origin of life should be accepted as an axiom.

(Mark Twain)   I’m reminded of a story about newspaper reporting in the old Soviet
Union (I don’t know if it’s true or not, but it illustrates a point
well). A car race between the United States and the Soviets ended with the
United States car in first, and the Soviet car second (you should also know
only  two cars were in this race). But the reporting in the Soviet Union
stated the Soviet car came in second, while the United States car came in
second to last. Perfectly true, and yet perfectly misleading.  You must be careful with statistics. For example, it’s possible the air in your room right now could
spontaneously all move in the same direction at once, piling up in the
other side of the room leaving you gasping for air. Possible, yes. But
when calculated, the probability is so small as to be reasonably rounded off
to zero (it’s not going to happen, so breathe easy).  A similar argument against evolution applies to the probability of
events occurring which result in new species (mutations, natural
selection  and spontaneous generation). That probability is zero (when rounded
off reasonably). It’s mathematically possible , but the
expectation is so low we logically round it down to zero and state the
event is never going to occur.  So the evolutionist has a problem — the odds of evolution
occurring are zero. One tactic evolutionists attempt to show the
theory isn’t ridiculous (i.e. mathematically impossible) is showing highly
improbable events happen all the time — unfortunately, it’s usually
through a misapplication of statistics. You see, simple logic and
common sense tell you if (as they claim) improbable events happen frequently
one  of two situations is most likely true.   The event really isn’t that improbable. Thus, our mathematical
calculation of statistical odds is incorrect — an error in math has
been made.  Statistics have been misused or misunderstood, similar to our car
race example. The facts and math are correct, but the application of
that knowledge is wrong.   Common sense explains the argument is already wrong, but we can
continue with a specific example and explain exactly why it’s wrong. One of the methods the evolutionist uses draws false
conclusions from a deck of cards — a mistake even a college professor
can make; consider the following discussion from a professor of
mathematics at Temple university.   So if, after the fact, we observe the particular
  evolutionary path actually taken and then calculate the a priori
  probability of its being taken, we will get the minuscule probability that
  creationists mistakenly attach to the process as a whole.
  Here’s another example. We have a deck of cards before us. There are
  almost 10 to the 68 th power – a one with 68 zeroes after it – orderings
  of the 52 cards in the deck. Any of the 52 cards might be first, any of the
  remaining 51 second, any of the remaining 50 third, and so on. This is a
  humongous number, but it’s not hard to devise even everyday situations that
  give rise to much larger numbers.  Now if we shuffle this deck of cards for a long time and then
  examine the particular ordering of the cards that happens to result, we
  would be justified in concluding that the probability of this particular
  ordering of the cards having occurred is approximately 1 chance in 10 to
  the 68th power. This certainly qualifies as minuscule.
  Still, we would not be justified in concluding that the shuffles
  could not have possibly resulted in this particular ordering because its a
  priori probability is so very tiny. Some ordering had to result from the
  shuffling, and this one did . (What’s wrong with Creationist Probability
  — Mathematics Professor John Allen Paulos of Temple University)   Mr. Paulos gets his math right, but the
statistics wrong. The card example comes up repeatedly in attempts to
show evolution isn’t mathematically impossible, but this is the first time
I’ve actually seen a professor of math make the mistake.  His problem lies in the card example. Suppose I have a deck of
cards. He is correct in the 10 68 combinations of cards (the
probability of any 1 combination occurring). But he makes the mistake
of applying statistics. Actually, by shuffling and dealing the cards the
probability is 1 — it’s a certainty one sequence
will occur (one of the 10 68 possibilities). Mr. Paulos does
understand this, as he says “Some ordering had to result from
the shuffling”.  The one in 10 68 is the probability of calling out each
card — in order — as you turn them up. That’s the correct analogy
between  cards and evolution. It’s a certainty you will get a sequence. But is it the exact sequence you want? Correct math, wrong
application. The probability is 1 you will get a sequence, but much
less likely you could correctly call out each card as it’s dealt (This is
also sometimes illustrated as a group of monkeys randomly typing out the
works of Shakespeare).  The card example illustrates a common mistake in the application of
statistics, and statistical mistakes can be difficult to uncover. As
already noted, if such improbable events really do happen commonly,
they’re not so improbable, are they (by definition)? But since the odds
calculation is correct (it’s not an error in math), it must be the application of knowledge.  Let’s turn to Physicist Richard Feynman to explain the faulty
reasoning and the professor’s error immediately becomes obvious. For
those who might not know, Feynman was a Nobel-prize winning physicist
involved in The Manhattan Project, and on the panel investigating the space
shuttle Challenger disaster. But perhaps best known for a series of
undergraduate lectures captured in the famous “Feynman lectures on Physics”, Feynman
had the ability to illustrate complex problems simply.   What came to Feynman by “common sense” were often
brilliant twists that perfectly captured the essence of his point.
Once, during a public lecture, he was trying to explain why one must not
verify an idea using the same data that suggested the idea in the first
place. Seeming to wander off the subject, Feynman began talking about
license plates. “You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I
was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the
parking lot. And you won’t believe what happened. I saw a car with the
license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates
in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one
tonight? Amazing!” A point even many scientists fail to grasp was
made clear through Feynman’s remarkable “common sense”. (“The Feynman
Lectures on Physics Volume I” , Feynman, Leighton, Sands page xi-xii)   Feynman makes Professor Paulos’ mistake
with the cards clear — it’s not an error in math ,
it’s an error in science . The issue with cards relating to
evolution isn’t that any given sequence is wildly improbable, yet a
sequence comes up — when dealing cards it’s a
statistical certainty a sequence will occur (probability
one). The correct example relating to evolution would be to predict
each card as it is dealt (probability zero).  Physicist Feynman illustrates the difficulty when applying
mathematical statistics to science. It’s quite easy to make a mistake,
even for a professor of mathematics; Feynman illustrates the error through
his license plate example. Don’t be misled by lengthly, complicated
examples — anyone truly understanding a subject should be able to
explain it simply, as Feynman did. Sometimes (though certainly not
always), the complicated explanation simply provides a way to mask the
uncertainty involved (In Physics we called that “hand-waving” — the idea being to
distract from a lack of substance).   Feynman was once asked by a Caltech faculty member to
explain why spin 1/2 particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. He gauged
his audience perfectly and said “I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it”.
But a few days later he returned and said “You know, I couldn’t do it. I
couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don’t
understand it”. (“The Feynman Lectures on Physics Volume I” ,
Feynman, Leighton, Sands page xii)   Predicting a sequence of cards as it is dealt is
impossible and correctly displays the improbability of evolution. The
probability of evolution occurring rounds down to zero — it’s not
going to happen.

It is a human tendency to search for meaning, and what could be more meaningful than the belief that our lives have a greater purpose, that all life in fact is guided by a supreme intelligence which manifests itself even at the level of individual molecules?  Proponents of intelligent design believe that the components of life are so complex that they could not possibly have been produced by an evolutionary process. To bolster their argument, they calculate the odds that a specific protein might assemble by chance in the prebiotic environment. The odds against such a chance assembly are so astronomically immense that a protein required for life to begin could not possibly have assembled by chance on the early Earth.  Therefore, the argument goes, life must have been designed. It is not my purpose to argue against this belief, but the intelligent design argument uses a statistical tool of science -- a probability calculation  -- to make a point, so I will use another tool of science, which is to propose an alternative hypothesis and test it.  In living cells, most catalysts are protein enzymes, composed of amino acids, but in the 1980s another kind of catalyst was discovered. These are RNA molecules composed of nucleotides that are now called ribozymes. Because a ribozyme can act both as a catalyst and as a carrier of genetic information in its nucleotide sequence, it has been proposed that life passed through an RNA World phase that did not require DNA and proteins. For the purposes of today’s column I will go through the probability  calculation that a specific ribozyme might assemble by chance. Assume that the ribozyme is 300 nucleotides long, and that at each position there could be any of four nucleotides present. The chances of that ribozyme assembling are then 4^300,  a number so large that it could not possibly happen by chance even once in 13 billion years, the age of the universe.  But life DID begin! Could we be missing something?  The answer, of course, is yes, we are. The calculation assumes that a single specific ribozyme must be synthesized for life to begin, but that’s not how it works. Instead,  let’s make the plausible assumption that an enormous number of random polymers are synthesized, which are then subject to selection and evolution. This is the alternative hypothesis, and we can test it. Now I will recall a classic experiment by David Bartel and Jack Szostak, published in Science in 1993. Their goal was to see if a completely random system of molecules could undergo selection in such a way that defined species of molecules emerged with specific properties. They began by synthesizing many trillions of different RNA molecules about 300 nucleotides long, but the nucleotides were all random nucleotide sequences. Nucleotides, by the way, are monomers of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, just as amino acids are the monomers, or subunits, of proteins, and making random sequences is easy to do with modern methods of molecular biology.  They reasoned that buried in those trillions were a few catalytic RNA molecules called ribozymes that happened to catalyze a ligation reaction, in which one strand of RNA is linked to a second strand. The RNA strands to be ligated were attached to small beads on a column, then were exposed to the trillions of random sequences simply by flushing them through the column. This process could fish out any RNA molecules that happened to have even a weak ability to catalyze the reaction. They then amplified those molecules and put them back in for a second round, repeating the process for 10 rounds. By the way, this is the same basic logic that breeders use when they select for a property such as coat color in dogs. The results were amazing. After only 4 rounds of selection and amplification they began to see an increase in catalytic activity, and after 10 rounds the rate was 7 million times faster than the uncatalyzed rate. It was even possible to watch the RNA evolve. Nucleic acids can be separated and visualized by a technique called gel electrophoresis. The mixture is put in at the top of a gel held between two glass plates and a voltage is applied. Small molecules travel fastest through the gel, and larger molecules move more slowly, so they are separated. In this case, RNA molecules having a specific length produce a visible band in a gel. At the start of the reaction, nothing could be seen, because all the molecules are different. But with each cycle new bands appeared. Some came to dominate the reaction, while others went extinct. Bartel and Szostak’s results have been repeated and extended by other researchers, and they demonstrate a fundamental principle of evolution at the molecular level. At the start of the experiment, every molecule of RNA was different from all the rest because they were assembled by a chance process. There were no species, just a mixture of trillions of different molecules. But then a selective hurdle was imposed, a ligation reaction that allowed only certain molecules to survive and reproduce enzymatically.  In a few generations groups of molecules began to emerge that displayed ever-increasing catalytic function. In other words, species of molecules appeared out of this random mixture in an evolutionary process that closely reflects the natural selection that Darwin outlined for populations of higher animals. These RNA molecules were defined by the sequence of bases in their structures, which caused them to fold into specific conformations that had catalytic properties. The sequences were in essence analogous to genes, because the information they contained was passed between generations during the amplification process. The Bartel and Szostak experiment directly refutes the argument that the odds are stacked against an origin of life by natural processes. The inescapable conclusion is that genetic information can in fact emerge from random mixtures of polymers, as long as the populations contain large numbers of polymeric molecules with variable monomer sequences, and a way to select and amplify a specific property. I will close with a quote from Freeman Dyson, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University who also enjoys thinking about the origin of life: “You  had what I call the garbage bag model. The early cells were just  little bags of some kind of cell membrane, which might have been  oily or it might have been a metal oxide.  And inside you  had a more or less random collection of organic molecules, with the  characteristic that small molecules could diffuse in through the  membrane, but big molecules could not diffuse out. By converting  small molecules into big molecules, you could concentrate the organic  contents on the inside, so the cells would become more concentrated  and the chemistry would gradually become more efficient. So these  things could evolve without any kind of replication.  It's a  simple statistical inheritance.  When a cell became so big that  it got cut in half, or shaken in half, by some rainstorm or environmental  disturbance, it would then produce two cells which would be its daughters,  which would inherit, more or less, but only statistically, the chemical  machinery inside.  Evolution could work under those conditions.”     Stars, Planets, Life    More Articles  What's It Like For a Working Scientist To Write a Novel?
