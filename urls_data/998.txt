Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.     Roll  1 die  2 dice  3 dice  4 dice  5 dice    1  1/6 (16.667%)  0  0  0  0    2  1/6 (16.667%)  1/36 (2.778%)  0  0  0    3  1/6 (16.667%)  2/36 (5.556%)  1/216 (0.463%)  0  0    4  1/6 (16.667%)  3/36 (8.333%)  3/216 (1.389%)  1/1296 (0.077%)  0    5  1/6 (16.667%)  4/36 (11.111%)  6/216 (2.778%)  4/1296 (0.309%)  1/7776 (0.013%)    6  1/6 (16.667%)  5/36 (13.889%)  10/216 (4.630%)  10/1296 (0.772%)  5/7776 (0.064%)    7  0 6/36 (16.667%) 15/216 (6.944%) 20/1296 (1.543%) 15/7776 (0.193%)  8  0  5/36 (13.889%)  21/216 (9.722%)  35/1296 (2.701%)  35/7776 (0.450%)   9  0  4/36 (11.111%)  25/216 (11.574%)  56/1296 (4.321%)  70/7776 (0.900%)   10  0  3/36 (8.333%)  27/216 (12.500%)  80/1296 (6.173%)  126/7776 (1.620%)   11  0  2/36 (5.556%)  27/216 (12.500%)  104/1296 (8.025%)  205/7776 (2.636%)   12  0  1/36 (2.778%)  25/216 (11.574%)  125/1296 (9.645%)  305/7776 (3.922%)   13  0  0  21/216 (9.722%)  140/1296 (10.802%)  420/7776 (5.401%)   14  0  0  15/216 (6.944%)  146/1296 (11.265%)  540/7776 (6.944%)   15  0  0  10/216 (4.630%)  140/1296 (10.802%)  651/7776 (8.372%)   16  0  0  6/216 (2.778%)  125/1296 (9.645%)  735/7776 (9.452%)   17  0  0  3/216 (1.389%)  104/1296 (8.025%)  780/7776 (10.031%)   18  0  0  1/216 (0.463%)  80/1296 (6.173%)  780/7776 (10.031%)   19  0  0  0  56/1296 (4.321%)  735/7776 (9.452%)   20  0  0  0  35/1296 (2.701%)  651/7776 (8.372%)   21  0  0  0  20/1296 (1.543%)  540/7776 (6.944%)   22  0  0  0  10/1296 (0.772%)  420/7776 (5.401%)   23  0  0  0  4/1296 (0.309%)  305/7776 (3.922%)   24  0  0  0  1/1296 (0.077%)  205/7776 (2.636%)   25  0  0  0  0  126/7776 (1.620%)   26  0  0  0  0  70/7776 (0.900%)   27  0  0  0  0  35/7776 (0.450%)   28  0  0  0  0  15/7776 (0.193%)   29  0  0  0  0  5/7776 (0.064%)   30  0  0  0  0  1/7776 (0.013%)  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number or less on a set of so many 6-sided dice. It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

and the Laws of Probability   by  Edward
D. Collins   For more questions and problems regarding dice (and coin)
probabilities, please see this page.           Let's
imagine you are playing a game which uses dice.  You are about to roll
three of them. You NEED to roll at least one 6. A 6 appearing on
any one (or more) of the three dice will win the game for you! What are
your chances?    33.3
%    42.1
%    50
%    66.6
%    Quite
some time ago, I was over at a friend's house watching him and another
friend play a board game called Axis & Allies. At one point this exact scenario came up - Kent was planning on rolling
three dice and really wanted at least one 6 to appear. He made a comment that with three
dice, his chances were 3 / 6 or 50%.  Kent's
reasoning was, with one die, the chances of rolling a 6 were 1 / 6 which is correct. He
also believed if he were to roll two dice, his chances were double this
or 2 / 6. This is INCORRECT and
this is where his faulty reasoning begins.  Knowing
a little bit about the laws of probability, I quickly knew the fraction
"2 / 6" for two dice and "3/6" for 
		three dice was incorrect and spent a brief moment computing and then 
		explaining the true percentages.  Unfortunately, I do not
believe I was successful in explaining to Kent why my figures were
correct. Maybe I can do so here.  Obviously,
with Kent's logic above, if the chances of rolling a 6 with two dice is
2 / 6 and the chances of
rolling a 6 with three dice is 3/6, then the chances of rolling a 6
with six dice would be 6 / 6 !!   100%?? Of course, this is obviously
incorrect. I don't care how many dice you roll, the chances of rolling
a 6 will never be 100%.  When
you roll just one die, there are six different ways the die can land,
as shown by the following graphic:                 When
two dice are rolled, there are now 36 different and unique ways the
dice can come up. This figure is arrived at by multiplying the number
of ways the first die can come up (six) by the number of ways the
second die can come up (six). 6 x 6 = 36.  This
graphic shows this very nicely. I've used two different colored dies to
help show a roll of 2-1 is different from a roll of 1-2.                     If
you use the above graphic and count the number of times is 6 appears
when two dice are rolled, you will see the answer is eleven. Eleven
times out of 36 or 30.5 %, slightly less than the 33.3% (2 / 6) Kent thought. When
you roll two dice, you have a 30.5 % chance at least one 6 will appear.  This
figure can also be figured out mathematically, without the use of the
graphic. One way to do so is to take the number of ways a single die
will NOT show a 6 when rolled (five) and multiply this by the number of
ways the second die will NOT show a 6 when rolled. (Also five.) 5 x 5 =
25. Subtract this from the total number of ways two dice can appear
(36) and we have our answer...eleven.  So,
let's use this same method to answer our question and determine the
chances of at least one 6 appearing when three dice
are rolled.  Take
the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the first die...   5 / 6   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the second die...   5 / 6 x 5 / 6 = 25 / 36   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the third die...   25 / 36 x 5 / 6 = 125 / 216   So,
there are 125 out of 216 chances of a 6 NOT appearing when three dice
are rolled. Simply subtract 125 from 216 which will give us the chances
a 6 WILL appear when three dice are rolled, which is 91. 91 out of 216
or 42.1 %, not quite the 50% Kent originally thought.  Here
is a table showing the fractions and percentages of a 6 appearing (or
any other single digit for that matter) and not appearing with several different numbers of dice:                     Chances
of NOT      rolling

you have just over a 50 % chance (51.77) of rolling at least one 6 when
rolling four dice. With six dice it's just over 66 %. Also notice even
when you roll nine dice, rolling a 6 is far from a certainty - you
have just a little better than 80 % chance of rolling this 6. This
means, on the average, even when you roll nine dice, two times out of
ten you will not roll a single 6!  Hope
this helped clear it up, Kent!  Learning the dice probabilities can be really useful when playing all 
		types of dice games and can give you quite an advantage if you're into

 solids and Archimedean duals the obvious
 choices. The die can be "rolled" by throwing it in the air and allowing
 it to come to rest on one of its faces. Dice are used in many games of chance as
 a way of picking random numbers on which to bet,
 and are used in board or role-playing games to determine the number of spaces to
 move, results of a conflict, etc. A coin can be viewed
 as a degenerate 2-sided case of a die.  In 1787, Mozart wrote the measures and instructions for a musical composition dice game. The idea is to cut and paste pre-written measures of music together to create a Minuet (Chuang).   The most common type of die is a six-sided cube with the numbers 1-6 placed on the faces. The value of the roll is indicated by the number
 of "spots" showing on the top. For the six-sided die, opposite faces are
 arranged to always sum to seven. This gives two possible mirror
 image arrangements in which the numbers 1, 2, and 3 may be arranged in a clockwise
 or counterclockwise order about a corner. Commercial dice may, in fact, have either
 orientation. The illustrations above show 6-sided dice with counterclockwise and
 clockwise arrangements, respectively, when viewed from along the three-fold rotation
 axis towards the center of the die.  The cube has the nice property that there is an upward-pointing face opposite the bottom face from which the value of the "roll" can easily
 be read. This would not be true, for instance, for a tetrahedral die, which would have to be picked up and turned over to reveal the number underneath
 (although it could be determined by noting which number 1-4 was not visible
 on one of the upper three faces). The arrangement of spots corresponding to a roll
 of 5 on a six-sided die is called the quincunx . There
 are also special names for certain rolls of two six-sided dice: two 1s are called snake eyes and two 6s are called Boxcars .  Shapes of dice other than the usual 6-sided cube are commercially available from companies such as Dice & Games, Ltd.® Diaconis and Keller
 (1989) show that there exist "fair" dice other than the usual Platonic
 solids and duals of the Archimedean solids ,
 where a fair die is one for which its symmetry group acts transitively on its faces
 (i.e., isohedra ). There are 30 isohedra.  The probability of obtaining points (a roll of ) on  -sided dice can
 be computed as follows. The number of ways in which can be obtained
 is the coefficient of in     (1)     since each possible arrangement contributes one term. can be written
 as a multinomial series     (2)   (3)    so the desired number is the coefficient of in     (4)     Expanding,     (5)     so in order to get the coefficient of , include all
 terms with     (6)      is therefore     (7)     But only when , so
 the other terms do not contribute. Furthermore,     (8)     so     (9)     where is the floor
 function , and     (10)     (Uspensky 1937, pp. 23-24).  Consider now . For six-sided dice,     (11)     and    (12)   (13)   (14)   (15)   (16)    The most common roll is therefore seen to be a 7, with probability , and the
 least common rolls are 2 and 12, both with probability 1/36.  For six-sided dice,     (17)     and    (18)   (19)   (20)   (21)    For three six-sided dice, the most common rolls are 10 and 11, both with probability 1/8; and the least common rolls are 3 and 18, both with probability 1/216.  For four six-sided dice, the most common roll is 14, with probability 73/648; and the least common rolls are 4 and 24, both with probability 1/1296.  In general, the likeliest roll for  -sided dice is given
 by     (22)     which can be written explicitly as     (23)     For 6-sided dice, the likeliest rolls are given by     (24)     or 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, ... for , 3, ... (OEIS A030123 ) dice. The probabilities corresponding

 shown above for , 2, 3, and 4 dice. They can be seen
 to approach a normal distribution as the number
 of dice is increased.     SEE ALSO:  Boxcars , Coin Tossing , Craps , de Méré's

What are the most likely outcomes from rolling a pair of dice?  Assuming we have a standard six-sided die, the odds of rolling a particular value are 1/6. There is an equal probability of rolling each of the numbers 1-6. But, when we have two dice, the odds are not as simple. For example, there's only one way to roll a two (snake eyes), but there's a lot of ways to roll a seven (1+6, 2+5, 3+4).  Let's count how many ways there are to get each value, 2 through 12:    Outcome  List of Combinations  Total    2  1+1  1    3  1+2, 2+1  2    4  1+3, 2+2, 3+1  3    5  1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1  4    6  1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1  5    7  1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1  6    8  2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 6+2  5    9  3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3  4    10  4+6, 5+5, 6+4  3    11  5+6, 6+5  2    12  6+6  1    If we want to calculate the probability of rolling, say, a five, we need to divide the number of ways to get 5 by the total possible combinations of two dice.  How many total combinations are possible from rolling two dice? Since each die has 6 values, there are \(6*6=36\) total combinations we could get. If you add up the numbers in the total column above, you'll get 36.  So, we can calculate the probabilities of each outcome:    Outcome  Probability    2  1/36 = 2.78%    3  2/36 = 5.56%    4  3/36 = 8.33%    5  4/36 = 11.11%    6  5/36 = 13.89%    7  6/36 = 16.67%    8  5/36 = 13.89%    9  4/36 = 11.11%    10  3/36 = 8.33%    11  2/36 = 5.56%    12  1/36 = 2.78%               © 2017 Free Math Help. All rights reserved.                Rolling Two Dice  When rolling two dice, distinguish between them in some way:  a first
one and second one, a left and a right, a red and a green, etc.  Let
(a,b) denote a possible outcome of rolling the two die, with a the
number on the top of the first die and b the number on the top of the second
die.  Note that each of a and b can be any of the integers from 1 through 6.
Here is a listing of all the joint possibilities for (a,b):    (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)   Note that there are 36 possibilities for (a,b).  This total number of possibilities can be obtained from the multiplication principle :  there are 6 possibilities for a, and for each outcome for a, there are 6 possibilities for b.  So,
the total number of joint outcomes (a,b) is 6 times 6 which is 36.  The set of
all possible outcomes for (a,b) is called the sample space of this probability experiment.  With the sample space now identified, formal probability theory requires
that we identify the possible events .
These are always subsets of the
sample space, and must form a sigma-algebra.  In an example such as this,
where the sample space is finite because it has only 36 different outcomes,
it is perhaps easiest to simply declare ALL subsets of the sample space to
be possible events.  That will be a sigma-algebra and avoids what might
otherwise be an annoying technical difficulty.  We make that declaration
with this example of two dice.  With the above declaration, the outcomes where the sum of the two
dice is equal to 5 form an event.
If we call this event E, we have E={(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)}. Note that we have listed all the ways a first die and second die add
up to 5 when we look at their top faces.  Consider next the probability of E, P(E).  Here we need more information.
If the two dice are fair and independent , each possibility (a,b) is equally likely.  Because there are
36 possibilities in all, and the sum of their probabilities must equal
1, each singleton event {(a,b)} is assigned probability equal to 1/36.
Because E is composed of 4 such distinct singleton events, P(E)=4/36=
1/9.  In general, when the two dice are fair and independent, the probability
of any event is the number of elements in the event divided by 36.  What if the dice aren't fair, or aren't independent of each other?
Then each outcome {(a,b)} is assigned a probability (a number in [0,1])
whose sum over all 36 outcomes is equal to 1.  These probabilities aren't
all equal, and must be estimated by experiment or inferred from other
hypotheses about how the dice are related and and how likely each number
is on each of the dice.  Then the probability of an event such as E
is the sum of the probabilities of the singleton events {(a,b)} that make
up E.      Go to the home page for Tom Ramsey    Go to the home page for the UHM Department of Mathemati

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

Just wanted to double check :) – FiguringItOut  Dec 8 '13 at 22:55        4      It's easier to calculate the probability that you roll no 6's, which is ${(\dfrac{5}{6}})^2 = 25/36$, leaving $11/36$ probability that you roll at least one. – NovaDenizen  Dec 8 '13 at 22:56         add a comment |           5 Answers 5     active  oldest  votes            up vote  16  down vote      That's right. The easier approach would be to calculate the chance of not rolling a $6$ - that's just $\frac56$ for the first die, and $\frac56$ for the second die, so by the product rule (as the events are independent), the probability is $\frac56 \cdot \frac56 = \frac{25}{36}$.  Then the probability of rolling a $6$ is $1$ minus the probability of not rolling a $6$, which we just calculated: so it is $1-\frac{25}{36}=\frac{11}{36}$.  If calculating the probability of an event not occurring to calculate the probability of it occurring feels weird to you, you might want to read up on complementary events . The idea here is that the product rule can sometimes make probabilities smaller when that wouldn't make any sense --- in our example, if you had just multiplied $\frac16 \cdot \frac16 = \frac1{36}$, then that would've been obviously wrong. This is because when we work with probability, we're dealing with quantities in the $[0,1]$ interval, so multiplication usually makes things smaller, rather than larger.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 8 '13 at 23:02       Newb   13k 9 35 72                  So, then is rolling one or two in two tries 20/36 a little under 60%? – jwize  Aug 9 '15 at 7:00        add a comment |             up vote  6  down vote      Yes indeed, you've got them all.

One die rolls a 6.  What is the probability of rolling a double 6?  One solution is to say that P(2 sixes) = $\frac{1}{6}$ since the first die gives a 6, so the only way to get a double six is by rolling a six on the other die (which has a 1 in 6 chance).  Another solution is to say that there are 11 possible combinations if one die rolls a six i.e. (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) and (6, 1).

You have rolled a six. Now for a double-six, you need to get a 6 on the
second roll. The second roll is independent of the first. So the probability
of a 6 again on the second roll is $1/6.$  If both dice have already been rolled out of your sight, and you are
told that there is at least one 6, then conditional on that information, what is the probability that the dice actually show a double-6. Then the analysis
of @Shayne2020 (+1) leading to the answer $1/11$ is correct.      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 28 '17 at 0:46             answered Oct 27 '17 at 22:55       BruceET   29.6k 5 14 39              add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      This can be phrased as   Given that at least one die rolls a 6, what is the probability of rolling a double 6?   We can use the conditional probability formula:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\ \mathrm{and}\ B)}{P(B)}$$
This means "the probability of event A given event B, is the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B".  \begin{align}
P(\mathrm{double\ 6}|\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6}) &= \frac{P(\mathrm{double\ 6}\ \mathrm{and}\ \mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}{P(\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}\\
&= \frac{P(\mathrm{double\ 6})}{P(\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}\\

This doesn't clarify which one. Was it the first die or the second one? (Note that the dice are distinguishable by the turn of their throws.)  So, the latter logic is correct. The conditional probability reduces the sample space $S$ into ${(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) (6, 1)}$  Now, $|S|= 11$  And the only favorable outcome (rolling two 6's ) is $(6,6)$.

This is not the only way to get just one 1, it could either be 1st, 2nd or 3rd and hence we have three ways and we multiply by 3, i.e P(one 1)=3*(1/6) (5/6) (5/6)=75/216.  Similiarly, with two 1's, you've calculated the probability that the first and second are 1 and the third is not (1)(1)(not 1). There are three ways that one of the dice aren't 1 and so we multiply by 3 to get 3*(1/6) (1/6) (5/6)=15/216.  The probability that all are 1 is .46% or 1/216 and when we add them altogether we have 91/216 or 42.129%.  However, the easier way to calculate this question is to ask the following, the chance of me getting at least one 1, is the same as the chance of me no 1's. The chance of getting no 1's is (5/6) (5/6) (5/6)= 125/216 and so the chance of you getting no 1's is 1-(125/216)=91/216=42.129%.  If you are wondering how to get the 3's when the question is more complicated, they are the coefficients in the relevant line of the binomial expansion, each to the right of the the minimal value you require (in your case you wanted at least one, the relevant line is 1 3 3 1 and so you count from the second giving 3,3,1) This is because the three rolls are Bernoulli trials, making this experient a binomial one.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 29 '16 at 21:00       Dan Barry   362 1 9              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      The easiest way to figure out odd for events with the words "at least" is often to figure out the contrary.
So here the contrary is : "you have no 1 on any of your 3 dice" and this probality is easy to figure out. It is : $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3=\frac{125}{216}$  So the probality of your event is : $1-\frac{125}{216}=\frac{91}{216}$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 29 '16 at 20:51       stity   2,990 3 12              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Exactly one 1 is not equivalent to the specific result (1,0,0) as you're calculating it. Because exactly 1 also includes (0,1,0) and (0,0,1). Similarly for two 1's. So you should multiply both of those probabilities with $3$. Note that your distribution here is the binomial distribution and you're missing the binomial part in its definition.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 29 '16 at 20:47       joedoe8585   722 2 10              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Let $X$ be the number of 1's rolled.  Your initial calculation $P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{216}$ gives you the probability of rolling exactly one 1 on the first die; you need to multiply this by 3 to account for possibly rolling a 1 on the second die or third die. While we can apply a similar procedure to accurately calculate $P(X = 2)$, then calculate $P(X \geq 1) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)$, it's easier to proceed by realizing that $P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)$; we just need to calculate the odds of rolling no 1's, then subtract that from 1.  \begin{align}
P(X = 0) &= (\frac{5}{6})^{3} = \frac{125}{216} \\
\\
P(X \geq 1) &= 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216} \\
\\
&\approx 42.1\%

You want to find the probability that die 1 rolls a six ($p = \frac 16$) while die 2 rolls anything else ($p = \frac 56$) OR vice versa.  The first case is simply $p = \frac 16 \cdot \frac 56 = \frac {5}{36} $.  The second case is simply the mirror of the first, with the same probability.  So the final probability is $p = (2)(\frac{5}{36}) = \frac {5}{18}$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 30 '15 at 12:00       Deepak   15.4k 1 13 35                  Why the downvote? – Deepak  Jul 18 '15 at 1:36        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      If the first die shows $6$ and the second shows anything but $6$ that can happen $5$ ways (6-1, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, 6-5). Similarly if the second die shows $6$ and the first anything but $6$ that can happen another $5$ ways (1-6, 2-6, 3-6, 4-6, 5-6).  There are $36$ possible rolls of the two dice in total.  Hence the probability of  exactly one die showing $6$ is  $${10 \over 36} = {5 \over 18}$$   Alternatively:   If   $A$ is the event that the first die is $6$ and the second anything  $B$ is the event that the second die is $6$ and the first anything   then the desired probability is  $$P(\text{One 6})  = P(\text{at least one 6}) - P(\text{two 6s}) $$ $$ \hspace{5 mm} = P(A \cup B) - P(A \cap B)$$ $$ = {11 \over 36} - {1 \over 36} \hspace{15 mm}$$ $$ = {10 \over 36} \hspace{27 mm}$$  This is also equal to  $$P(\text{ first is 6 but not the second }) + P(\text{ second is 6 but not the first })$$  $$ = (P(A) -  P(A \cap B)) + (P(B)-  P(A \cap B))$$  $$ = P(A) + P(B) - 2P(A\cap B)$$  $$= {6 \over 36} + {6 \over 36} - 2 \cdot {1 \over 36}$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 30 '15 at 14:15             answered May 30 '15 at 11:52       Simon S   22.8k 6 32 78                  Great, and would this formula for calculating be correct: P(A U B) - P(A & B)? thanks. – Daniel Valland  May 30 '15 at 12:43            @DanielValland yes, see edit above. – Simon S  May 30 '15 at 14:04        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Lets consider two events: A - the first dice gets 6, B - the second.

Allowed outcomes is the complementary of unallowed outcomes which can be split into "both dice < 6" ( case 1 ) "and" "not both dice = 6" ( case 2 ):
$6^2 - 5^2 - 1^2 = 36-25-1 = 10$. We can write this as a binary number matrix with the indices equal to the dice results:
$\left(\begin{array}{cccccc} 1&1&1&1&1&0\\1&1&1&1&1&0\\1&1&1&1&1&0\\1&1&1&1&1&0\\1&1&1&1&1&0\\0&0&0&0&0&2\end{array}\right)$ we see that the number of which are 0 is 10.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 30 '15 at 13:18       mathreadler   12.9k 7 17 54              add a comment |       Not the answer you're looking for?

An example of what i am looking of is rolling a 4+ on a D6 and the odds on rolling a 5+ on a D6 but you get to reroll it once if its not 5+.  By calculating there probability i can see which has a higher chance of happening.  How does the reroll affect the probability ?
How would multiple dice afffect the probability, say i was rolling three dice instead of one ?  I have lots of other scenerions the involve rerolling so it would be best if you could explain the method rather than just give me a a formula.  A formula answering my question would be great but it would bb better if i could understand it myself so i dont have to keep asking similar questions on here.    probability  dice     share | cite | improve this question     asked Aug 28 '13 at 13:56       Skeith   106 1 1 3              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote      The probability that you roll 4+ is the probability that you roll a 4, a 5, or a 6.  Each of these events has probability $\frac{1}{6}$; so, the probability of rolling 4+ is $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$.  For your other scenario, note that the event that you get a 5+ when you are allowed on re-roll can be broken up in to two disjoint events: event $A$, in which you roll a 5+ on the first try; and event $B$, in which you roll a number 1-4 on your first attempt, and either a 5 or 6 on the second.  Then $P(A)=\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$, since this is the event that you roll either a 5 or a 6.  For $B$, we have
$$
P(B)=\frac{4}{6}\cdot\frac{2}{6}=\frac{2}{9},
$$
since you must roll a 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the first attempt and either a 5 or 6 on the second. So, overall, the probability of getting 5+ when you allow one re-roll is 
$$
P(A\text{ or }B)=P(A)+P(B)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{9}=\frac{5}{9}.
$$
(Note that we have used here that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint possibilities.)  So, you are more likely to get a 5+ with a re-roll allowed than to get a 4+ with no re-roll.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 28 '13 at 14:05       Nick Peterson   24.8k 2 34 55                  Does the amount of dice rolled effect the probability for instance if you were rolling two dice, would i just add the probabilities together ? – Skeith  Aug 28 '13 at 14:13            If you are rolling two dice, and they are independent -- that is, the outcome of one roll does not change the probabilities of specific outcomes of the second -- then you multiply the probabilities. – Nick Peterson  Aug 28 '13 at 16:22        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Assuming a fair six sided dice  The probability of rolling a 4 or more (4, 5 or 6) from a single roll is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ as there a three winning results and 6 possibilities.  The probability of rolling a 5 or more (5 or 6) from a single roll is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$ as there a two winning results and 6 possibilities.  The probability of rolling a 5 or more (5 or 6) if two rolls are allowed is $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3}= \frac{5}{9}$ This is the probability of getting a 5 or more on the first roll plus the probability that you don't get a 5 or more of the first roll (so get to roll again) times the probability of getting a 5 or more on the second roll.  Note : the probability of getting at least one 5 or 6 would be the same $\frac{5}{9}$ If you rolled both dice at the same time.  The probability that the first dice is 5 or more plus the probability that you need to look at the second dice times the probability its 5 or more.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Aug 28 '13 at 14:16             answered Aug 28 '13 at 14:10       Warren Hill   2,574 9 21              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Ok so in general, say we have 1 roll. Obviously we have a 1 in 6 chance to roll any number. But think of total number of possibilities. There's only 6 possibilities here. Keep that in mind.  Now roll two dice. We have 36 possibilities. 3 dice 216 possibilities...etc. One thing that might help you understand probability with dice is say we roll 6 dice and want to know the probabilty of rolling a six. Many people think...mistakenly...well, if it's a 1 in 6 chance to roll a 6 on each die, then there is a 100% probability of rolling a 6! Well, that's actually wrong. Since there are $46,656$ possible outcomes, and $5^6 = 15,625$ do not have a 6, well then the probability is only $\frac{46,656 - 15,625}{46,656} = 66.5%$. Now I think you may have a better understanding.

probabilities, please see this page.           Let's
imagine you are playing a game which uses dice.  You are about to roll
three of them. You NEED to roll at least one 6. A 6 appearing on
any one (or more) of the three dice will win the game for you! What are
your chances?    33.3
%    42.1
%    50
%    66.6
%    Quite
some time ago, I was over at a friend's house watching him and another
friend play a board game called Axis & Allies. At one point this exact scenario came up - Kent was planning on rolling
three dice and really wanted at least one 6 to appear. He made a comment that with three
dice, his chances were 3 / 6 or 50%.  Kent's
reasoning was, with one die, the chances of rolling a 6 were 1 / 6 which is correct. He
also believed if he were to roll two dice, his chances were double this
or 2 / 6. This is INCORRECT and
this is where his faulty reasoning begins.  Knowing
a little bit about the laws of probability, I quickly knew the fraction
"2 / 6" for two dice and "3/6" for 
		three dice was incorrect and spent a brief moment computing and then 
		explaining the true percentages.  Unfortunately, I do not
believe I was successful in explaining to Kent why my figures were
correct. Maybe I can do so here.  Obviously,
with Kent's logic above, if the chances of rolling a 6 with two dice is
2 / 6 and the chances of
rolling a 6 with three dice is 3/6, then the chances of rolling a 6
with six dice would be 6 / 6 !!   100%?? Of course, this is obviously
incorrect. I don't care how many dice you roll, the chances of rolling
a 6 will never be 100%.  When
you roll just one die, there are six different ways the die can land,
as shown by the following graphic:                 When
two dice are rolled, there are now 36 different and unique ways the
dice can come up. This figure is arrived at by multiplying the number
of ways the first die can come up (six) by the number of ways the
second die can come up (six). 6 x 6 = 36.  This
graphic shows this very nicely. I've used two different colored dies to
help show a roll of 2-1 is different from a roll of 1-2.                     If
you use the above graphic and count the number of times is 6 appears
when two dice are rolled, you will see the answer is eleven. Eleven
times out of 36 or 30.5 %, slightly less than the 33.3% (2 / 6) Kent thought. When
you roll two dice, you have a 30.5 % chance at least one 6 will appear.  This
figure can also be figured out mathematically, without the use of the
graphic. One way to do so is to take the number of ways a single die
will NOT show a 6 when rolled (five) and multiply this by the number of
ways the second die will NOT show a 6 when rolled. (Also five.) 5 x 5 =
25. Subtract this from the total number of ways two dice can appear
(36) and we have our answer...eleven.  So,
let's use this same method to answer our question and determine the
chances of at least one 6 appearing when three dice
are rolled.  Take
the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the first die...   5 / 6   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the second die...   5 / 6 x 5 / 6 = 25 / 36   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the third die...   25 / 36 x 5 / 6 = 125 / 216   So,
there are 125 out of 216 chances of a 6 NOT appearing when three dice
are rolled. Simply subtract 125 from 216 which will give us the chances
a 6 WILL appear when three dice are rolled, which is 91. 91 out of 216
or 42.1 %, not quite the 50% Kent originally thought.  Here
is a table showing the fractions and percentages of a 6 appearing (or
any other single digit for that matter) and not appearing with several different numbers of dice:                     Chances
of NOT      rolling

6 dice          15,625 / 46,656      33.49 %          31,031 / 46,656      66.51 %            ...with
7 dice          78,125  /  279,936      27.91 %          201,811 /  279,936      72.09 %            ...with
8 dice          390,625 / 1,679,616      23.26

9 dice          1,953,125  /  10,077,696      19.38 %          8,124,571  /  10,077,696      80.62 %                     Notice
you have just over a 50 % chance (51.77) of rolling at least one 6 when
rolling four dice. With six dice it's just over 66 %. Also notice even
when you roll nine dice, rolling a 6 is far from a certainty - you
have just a little better than 80 % chance of rolling this 6. This
means, on the average, even when you roll nine dice, two times out of
ten you will not roll a single 6!  Hope
this helped clear it up, Kent!  Learning the dice probabilities can be really useful when playing all

Rolling Two Dice  When rolling two dice, distinguish between them in some way:  a first
one and second one, a left and a right, a red and a green, etc.  Let
(a,b) denote a possible outcome of rolling the two die, with a the
number on the top of the first die and b the number on the top of the second
die.  Note that each of a and b can be any of the integers from 1 through 6.
Here is a listing of all the joint possibilities for (a,b):    (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)   Note that there are 36 possibilities for (a,b).  This total number of possibilities can be obtained from the multiplication principle :  there are 6 possibilities for a, and for each outcome for a, there are 6 possibilities for b.  So,
the total number of joint outcomes (a,b) is 6 times 6 which is 36.  The set of
all possible outcomes for (a,b) is called the sample space of this probability experiment.  With the sample space now identified, formal probability theory requires
that we identify the possible events .
These are always subsets of the
sample space, and must form a sigma-algebra.  In an example such as this,
where the sample space is finite because it has only 36 different outcomes,
it is perhaps easiest to simply declare ALL subsets of the sample space to
be possible events.  That will be a sigma-algebra and avoids what might
otherwise be an annoying technical difficulty.  We make that declaration
with this example of two dice.  With the above declaration, the outcomes where the sum of the two
dice is equal to 5 form an event.
If we call this event E, we have E={(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)}. Note that we have listed all the ways a first die and second die add
up to 5 when we look at their top faces.  Consider next the probability of E, P(E).  Here we need more information.
If the two dice are fair and independent , each possibility (a,b) is equally likely.  Because there are
36 possibilities in all, and the sum of their probabilities must equal
1, each singleton event {(a,b)} is assigned probability equal to 1/36.
Because E is composed of 4 such distinct singleton events, P(E)=4/36=
1/9.  In general, when the two dice are fair and independent, the probability
of any event is the number of elements in the event divided by 36.  What if the dice aren't fair, or aren't independent of each other?
Then each outcome {(a,b)} is assigned a probability (a number in [0,1])
whose sum over all 36 outcomes is equal to 1.  These probabilities aren't
all equal, and must be estimated by experiment or inferred from other
hypotheses about how the dice are related and and how likely each number
is on each of the dice.  Then the probability of an event such as E
is the sum of the probabilities of the singleton events {(a,b)} that make
up E.      Go to the home page for Tom Ramsey    Go to the home page for the UHM Department of Mathemati

Anthony Bradshaw/Getty Images      Rolling two six-sided dice is common in many of the most popular board games, including Monopoly , Backgammon and The Settlers of Catan. Even if you don't memorize the percentages in the chart below, it's helpful to have a general sense of how common each roll is. When it is your turn and you are two spaces away from landing on an opponent's hotel in Monopoly, this probability chart may comfort you.         Dice Roll Probability The chance of rolling a total of 2 is 2.78 percent The chance of rolling a total of 3 is 5.56 percent The chance of rolling a total of 4 is 8.33 percent The chance of rolling a total of 5 is 11.11 percent The chance of rolling a total of 6 is 13.89 percent The chance of rolling a total of 7 is 16.67 percent The chance of rolling a total of 8 is 13.89 percent The chance of rolling a total of 9 is 11.11 percent The chance of rolling a total of 10 is 8.33 percent The chance of rolling a total of 11 is 5.56 percent The chance of rolling a total of 12 is 2.78 percent There's only one combination that yields a total of 2—when each die displays a 1. Likewise, there is only one combination that yields a total of 12—when each die displays a 6. They are the least likely combinations to occur. As you can see, 7 is the most common roll with two six-sided dice. You are six times more likely to roll a 7 than a 2 or a 12, which is a huge difference.   You are twice as likely to roll a 7 as you are to roll a 4 or a 10. However, it's only 1.2 times more likely that you'll roll a 7 than a 6 or an 8. Another way of looking at these numbers is that, over time, you will roll one 4 or 10 for every two 7s rolled. You'll see six 7s for every 2 or 12. Of course, dice have a bad habit of defying expectations, so don't rely on probabilities from a chart like this to work out your game strategy.         You're likely to find yourself on the losing end of a game if you do.

First lets look at the possibilities of the total of two dice. The table below shows the six possibilities for die 1 along the left column and the six possibilities for die 2 along the top column. The body of the table shows the sum of die 1 and die 2.   Two Dice Totals    Die 1  Die 2    1  2  3  4  5  6    1  2  3  4  5  6  7    2  3  4  5  6  7  8    3  4  5  6  7  8  9    4  5  6  7  8  9  10    5  6  7  8  9  10  11    6  7  8  9  10  11  12      The colors of the body of the table illustrate the number of ways to throw each total. The probability of throwing any given total is the number of ways to throw that total divided by the total number of combinations (36). In the following table the specific number of ways to throw each total and the probability of throwing that total is shown.      Total  Number of Combinations  Probability    2  1  2.78%    3  2  5.56%    4  3  8.33%    5  4  11.11%    6  5  13.89%    7  6  16.67%    8  5  13.89%    9  4  11.11%    10  3  8.33%    11  2  5.56%    12  1  2.78%    Total  36  100%      The following shows the probability of throwing each total in a chart format. As the chart shows the closer the total is to 7 the greater is the probability of it being thrown.   The Field Bet Example  Now that we understand the probability of throwing each total we can apply this information to the dice games in the casinos to calculate the house edge. For example consider the field bet in craps . This bet pays 1:1 (even money) if the next throw is a 3, 4, 9, 10, or 11, 2:1 (double the bet) on the 2, and 3:1 (triple the bet) on the 12. Note that there are 7 totals that win and only 4 that lose which might cause someone who didn't know better to think it was a good gamble.  The player's return can be defined as the sum of the products of the probability of each event and the net return of that event. The following table shows each possible total, the net return, the probability of throwing that total, and the average return. The average return is the product of the net return and the probability. The player's return is the sum of the average returns.      Total  Net Return  Probability  Average Return    2  2  0.0278  0.0556    3  1  0.0556  0.0556    4  1  0.0833  0.0833    5  -1  0.1111  -0.1111    6  -1  0.1389  -0.1389    7  -1  0.1667  -0.1667    8  -1  0.1389  -0.1389    9  1  0.1111  0.1111    10  1  0.0833  0.0833    11  1  0.0556  0.0556    12  3  0.0278  0.0834    Total   1  -0.0278      The last row shows the player's return to be -.0278, in other words for every $1 bet the player can expect to lose 2.78 cents. The player's loss is the house's gain so the house edge is the product of -1 and the player's return, in this case 0.0278 or 2.78%.

Jeff B. from Miami, Florida   The answer is 6*(1/6) 6 = 6/46,656 = 1/7,776 =~ 0.0001286 .     What is the average number of rolls until a shooter "sevens out"? I know that a 7 will appear every 6 rolls, but with come-out 7-11s and craps, plus the possibility of shooters making multiple points, I think the average number of rolls may be higher than expected. Is there any mathematical reference material on this?  Grshooter from Kansas City, Missouri   The average number of rolls per shooter is 8.525510.  For the probability of exactly 2 to 200 rolls, please see my craps probability of survival page .     What are the odds (and frequency) in 100,000 rolls of the dice (craps/dont pass line) of losing a DP bet 2x’s.3x’s 4x’s 5x’s 6x’s 7x’s 8x’s or 9x’s in a row.  Derick from Minneapolis, USA   My craps appendix shows how to work out the odds for any one bet. There you will see the probability of losing the don’t pass bet is 2928/5940. The probability of losing n bets in a row is (2928/5940) n . The frequency in 100,000 of losing exactly n can be closely approximated as 100,000 * (2928/5940) n+2 .     What are the odds of rolling the same number with six dice in one roll?  Kyle Hill from Colstrip, Montana   The odds of getting six of the same number with six dice is 6*(1/6) 6 =1/7776 =~ 0.01286%.     How often can you roll a pair of dice 28 times without getting a 7? How do you figure this? Congratulation on your site, it’s great.  Arturo G. from Mexico City, Mexico   Thanks for the compliment. I take it you mean what is the probability of rolling a pair of dice 28 times without getting a 7. The probability of not rolling a 7 on any one roll is 5/6. The probability of not rolling a 7 in 28 rolls is (5/6) 28 = 0.006066, or about 1 in 165.     Just a question about an Oriental dice game, where the players are supposed to guess which side of the die shows up. The players will first place their bets on 1,2,3,4,5,6 (like roulette) and then the "dealer" will roll 3 dice simultaneously. Payouts are 1:1 if the chosen numbers shows up once (on any of the 3 dice), 2:1 if the chosen no shows up twice, and 3:1 if the chosen number appears on all 3 dice. As the player can place any number of bets of the board, what will be the optimum number of bets to place? (assuming all my bets are equal in size)  Jansen from Toronto, Canada   The probability of three matching is 1/216. The probability of two matching is 3*5/216. The probability of one matching is 25*5/216. The probability of 0 matching is 5*5*5/216. So the expected return is 3*(1/216)+2*(15/216)+1*(75/216)-1*(125/216)=-17/216=-7.87%. There is no optimal number of bets, you will give up an expected 7.87% of total money bet no matter what you do. These bets can be made in both sic bo and chuck a luck .     Mr. Wizard, what is the probability of rolling two pair when rolling four dice?  Brian from St. Catherines, Canada   There are combin(6,2)=15 different sets of pairs possible. There are combin (4,2)=6 ways the dice can roll any specific two pair. There are 6^4=1296 ways to roll four dice. So the probability is 90/1296=6.9444%.     If I roll a die, my probability of rolling a six is 1/6. If I roll two dice, does my probability of rolling a six on one of them increase, or does it stay at 1/6?  Mike R. from Rosemount   If you rolled x dice the probability of getting at least one 6 is 1-(5/6) 2 . In the case of two dice this is 30.56%.     How many different ways are there of rolling 3 ones using 6 dice?  Jamie from Croydon, England   First there are combin (6,3)=20 ways you can choose three dice out of 6 for the three ones. Then each of the other three can be any of five numbers. So, the total ways are 20×5 3 =2500. The total number of ways to throw all the dice are 6 6 =46,656, so the probability of rolling exactly three ones is 2500/46656=0.0536. For help with the combin function see my probabilities in poker section.     What is the probability of any one die showing ONE when 3 dice are throw together. My understanding is it should be 50% chance (1/6+1/6+1/6=1/2 -->50%) But in your odds table it shown 34.72%. Please help.  John C. from Singapore   The probability of rolling exactly one one with three dice is 3*(5/6) 2 *(1/6) = 75/216 = 34.72%.     What is the probability of rolling a "pair" when tossing 4 dice?  Anthony from Toronto, Canada   The pair can be any one of 6 numbers. The other two singletons can be among the other five. So there are 6*combin(5,2)=60 combinations already. There are combin(4,2)=6 combinations of dice on which the pair can appear. The two singletons can be arrange in two ways. So there are 60*12=720 ways to throw a pair. The total number of all ways to throw the dice is 6 4 =1296. So the probability is 720/1296 =~ 55.56%.     My friend owns a bar and has a "shake of the day" where there are ten dice in a Tupperware container, what are the odds of matching 8 out of the 10 in one shake. Thank you for your time.  August from Oshkosh, USA   The probability that if you roll 10 dice and exactly 8 numbers are the same is 6*combin(10,8)*(1/6) 8 *(5/6) 2 = 1/8957.952. The probability of matching at least 8 is 6*[combin(10,8)*(1/6) 8 *(5/6) 2 + combin(10,9)*(1/6) 9 *(5/6) + (1/6) 10 ] = 1/8569.469.     I recently rolled, during a game of backgammon, double sixes four consecutive times. What are the odds of this happening again?  David from Sunland, USA   With every new roll the probability the next four rolls will be all double sixes is (1/36) 4 = 1 in 1679616.     What is the probability of getting a straight by a single throw of 5 dice?  Teodoro C. Deocares from Dagupan, Philippines   There are two possible spans: 1 to 5 and 2 to 6. Each of these spans can be ordered in 5!=120 ways. There are 6 5 = 7776 ways to roll five dice. So the probability is 2*120/7776 = 3.09%. The probability of this seems to be much higher right after I put mark 0 for large straight during a game of Yahtzee.     A fair sided die is rolled 30 times. What is the expected number of times that number 1 will come up? What is the probability that number 1 will come up it’s expected number of times?  Anonymous   The expected number of ones is 30*(1/6) = 5. The probability of exactly 5 ones is combin(30,5)*(1/6) 5 *(5/6) 25 = 19.21%.     If I have any give number of dice what is the probability that if I roll them all of them at least one will land on a one?  Anonymous   The probability that all the dice will not be a one is (5/6) n . So the probability of at least one 1 is 1-(5/6) n . Let’s take an example of five dice. The answer would be 1-(5/6) 5 = 59.81%.     If I throw 36 dice what is the probability of getting at least one six?  Anonymous   1-(5/6) 36 = 99.86%     If I kept throwing and removed all the sixes each time, how would I predict the theoretical number of dice remaining after a particular number of throws?  Anonymous   Each roll the expectation is that 5/6 of the dice will remain. So the expected number of dice remaining after n throws would be 36*(5/6) n . For example after 10 throws you would have 5.81 dice left, on average.     If I roll three dice, what is the probability of getting at least two numbers the same?  Anonymous   The probability all numbers will be different is (5/6)*(4/6)=20/36. So the probability at least two numbers will be the same is 1-(20/36) = 16/36 = 44.44%.     If two people throw a pair of dice, What is the probability that it is the same number? Is there a formula to figure this out?  Anonymous   Yes. You simply run through all total from 2 to 12 and determine the probability of rolling each twice. So the answer would be (1/36) 2 +(2/36) 2 +(3/36) 2 +(4/36) 2 +(5/36) 2 +(6/36) 2 +(5/36) 2 +(4/36) 2 +(3/36) 2 +(2/36) 2 +(1/36) 2 = 11.27%.     I recently attended a hospital fete. There was a new car as a prize if 7 dice produced 7 sixes in one throw. £1.00 a go. Odds on this must be high but how high?  Anonymous   The probability of throwing seven sixes with seven dice is (1/6) 7 = 1 in 279,936. So the car would have to have a value of £279,936 or more for this to be a good bet. Even your average Rolls Royce is not worth this much, so I would say that was a terrible bet. [Bluejay adds: Uh, yeah, but I think the point was that it was for charity. What’s more fun: Donating £1.00 to charity and getting nothing back but the good feeling of helping out, or donating £1.00 and getting the good feeling plus the longshot chance of winning a car?]     What are the probabilities for a 5 of a kind, 4 of a kind, 3 of a kind, full house, 2 pair, pair, straight, and nothing with the roll of five dice?  Anonymous    Five of a kind: 6/6 5 = 0.08% (obvious)  Four of a kind: 5*6*5 = 1.93% (five possible positions for the singleton * 6 ranks for the four of a kind * 5 ranks for the singleton).  Full house: combin(5,3)*6*5/6 5 = 3.86% (combin(5,3) positions for the three of a kind * 6 ranks for the three of a kind * 2 ranks for the pair).  Three of a kind: COMBIN(5,3)*COMBIN(2,1)*6*COMBIN(5,2) / 6 5 = 15.43%. (combin(5,3) positions for the three of a kind * combin(2,1) positions for the larger of the singletons * 6 ranks of the three of a kind * combin(5,2) ranks for the two singletons.  Two pair: COMBIN(5,2)*COMBIN(3,2)*COMBIN(6,2)*4 / 6 5 = 23.15% (combin(5,2) positions for the higher pair * combin(3,2) positions for the lower pair * combin(6,4) ranks for the two pair * 4 ranks for the singleton.  Pair: COMBIN(5,2)*fact(3)*6*combin(5,3) / 6 5 = 46.30% (combin(5,2) positions for the pair * fact(3) positions for the three singletons * 6 ranks for the pair * combin(5,3) ranks for the singletons.  Straight: 2*fact(5) / 6 5 = 3.09% (2 spans for the straight {1-5 or 2-6} * fact(5) ways to arrange the order). Nothing: ((COMBIN(6,5)-2)*FACT(5)) / 6 5 = 6.17% (combin(6,5) ways to choose 5 ranks out of six, less 2 for the straights, * fact(5) ways to arrange the order.      Hi Wizard, I wanted to know if you can answer this. In a popular gambling game in 17th century France, a player would roll a pair of dice 24 times. He would win his bet if at least one of these rolls was a double six. There was a debate at the time over whether the probability of winning was above or below an even 50%. Can you help me?  Anonymous   Sure, this is easy. The probability of rolling at least one 12 in 24 rolls is 1-(35/36) 24 = 49.14%. So the odds favor betting against a 12. This is a clever bet because the expected number of twelves in 24 rolls is 2/3. However that does not mean the probability of a 12 is 2/3, because sometimes there will be more than one 12, and the player betting on 12 doesn’t win any more for extra twelves after the first one. If the probability of winning any given trial is p, the number of trials is n, and the probability of at least one win is w then solving for n in terms of p and w gives us... w=1-(1-p) n 1-w = (1-p) n log(1-w) = log((1-p) n ) log(1-w) = n*log(1-p) n= log(1-w)/log(1-p)  So in your example n = log(1-.5) / log(1-(1/36)) = log(0.5) / log(35/36) = 24.6051. So if the probability of success is 50% in 24.6 rolls it must be slightly less in 24 rolls.     What is the probability of rolling 1,2,3,4,5,6 with six dice, six times in a row?  Anonymous   The probability of rolling 123456 with six dice in a single roll can be expressed as prob(second die does not match first die) * prob(third die does not match first or second die) * ... = 1*(5/6)*(4/6)*(3/6)*(2/6)*(1/6) = 0.015432. So the probability of doing this six times in a row is 0.015432 6 = 1 in 74,037,208,411.     If I roll a single die 6 times, what is the probability of getting a "2" exactly 4 times?  Anonymous   Combin(6,2)*(1/6) 4 *(5/6) 2 = 0.008037551.     What is the probability of rolling 13 or more with 3, 4, and 5 dice, if you are allowed to keep the highest three dice in your roll?  Anonymous   Here are the probabilities: 3 dice: 25.93% 4 dice: 48.77% 5 dice: 66.13%.     Suppose we roll three fair six-sided dice.  What’s the conditional probability that the first dice shows 4, given that the sum of the three numbers showing is 12?  Shikha from North Ryde   The probability of A given B is the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B.  In this case the probability of rolling a 4 on the first die and then a total of 8 on the other two is (1/6)*(5/36) = 5/216.  The probability of rolling any total of 12 with 3 dice is 25/216, as shown in my sic bo section.  So the answer is (5/216)/(25/216) = 5/25 = 20%.     In a recent programming exercise myself and other students were asked to describe a six-sided die in code, and then use our dice to determine play simple game. The object of the game was to roll the dice until the sum of the tosses reached exactly 100. Any toss that put the total over 100 would not be added and merely added to statistics. Quickly it was determined that 17 throws would be the least amount of throws needed to reach 100. However calculating the odds of that occurring has proved elusive. Calculating the odds of a specific sequence of throws is rather straight forward, but how might one factor in both non-specific ordering of throws, and the different ways of reaching 100 in 17 throws (16*6 + 1*4 and 15*6 + 2*5)?  from   The two ways you mention are the only ways to throw a total of 100 in 17 throws.  The probability of throwing 16 sixes and one four is 17*(1/6) 17 .  There are 17 possible positions of the 4 and each sequence has a probability of (1/6)*(1/6)*...*(1/6) with 17 terms.  The number of ways to get 15 sixes and 2 fives is combin (17,2) = 136.  So the probability of 15 sixes and 2 fives is 136*(1/6) 17 .  So the total probability is (17+136)*(1/6) 17 . = 1 in 110,631,761,077.     There are 3 dice, 2 are proper six sided dice, while one is a die with all sides containing a six. All the dice are in my pocket. I randomly take out a die and throw it.  The result is a 6.  What is the probability that the die was one of the proper dice with 6 different values?  Annojh from Toronto   Let A = Choosing the normal die Let B = Rolling a 6 with randomly chosen die Answer = Pr(A given B) = Pr(A and B)/pr(B) = ((2/3)*(1/6))/((2/3)*(1/6)+(1/3)*1) = (2/18)/((2/18)+(6/18)) = 1/4.     If you can roll six dice only once, what is the probability of rolling 6,6,6,6,1, and 4 in any order?  Aubrey from Kokomo   There are 6!/(4!*1!*1!) = 30 ways to arrange these numbers in any order.  Another way to look at it is there are 6 positions to put the 1, and 5 left to put the 4, so 6*5=30.  The probability of getting 666614 in exactly that order is 1 in 6 6 = 1 in 46656.  Multiply that by 30 for the 30 possible orders and the answer is 30/46656 = 0.0643%, or 1 in 1552.2.     My understanding of "wait time" for an event is the reciprocal of the probability of that event.  I’m interested in calculating the wait time to roll consecutive 2s using one die.  In a simulation I get 42 rolls on average.  How do I make the connection with the probability of rolling consecutive 2s?  Lee from Andover   It is true that for single events if the probability is p then the average wait time is 1/p.  However it gets more complicated with consecutive events.  Let x be the state that the last roll was not a two.  This is also the state at the beginning.  Let y be the state that the last roll was a two.  After the first roll there is a 5/6 chance we will still be in state x, and 1/6 chance we will be in state y.  Let Ex(x) be the expected number of rolls from state x, and Ex(y) the expected number from state y.  Then... Ex(x) = 1 + (5/6)*ex(x) + (1/6)*ex(y), and Ex(y) = 1 + (5/6)*ex(x) Solving for these two equations... Ex(x) = 1 + (5/6)*ex(x) + (1/6)*( 1 + (5/6)*Ex(x)) Ex(x) = 7/6 + (35/36)*Ex(x) (1/36)*Ex(x) = 7/6 Ex(x) = 36*(7/6) = 42 So the average wait time for two consecutive twos is 42 rolls. I have the same type of problem, only the expected flips to get two heads, in my site of math problems , see problem 128.     Can you tell me the odds of rolling two of the same number with two dice, three dice, and four dice?  I am wondering how many dice would one have to roll at one time so that the odds are on the side of the person rolling the dice. (It does not make any difference which number is doubled.)  Mary from Minneapolis, MN   Here is the probability of getting at least one number more than once according to the number of rolls:  Probability of a Pair or More    Rolls  Probability   2 rolls  16.67%   3 rolls  44.44%   4 rolls  72.22%   5 rolls  90.74%   6 rolls  98.46%     What is the chance of getting a sum over 100, when rolling 20 dice? Kind regards  Terje from Stockholm   I started to use the Normal approximation to solve this, but the probability of over 100 points is too low for that method to be accurate.  So I did a random simulation of 8.25 million trials and the number of trails that were 101 points or more was 127.  So the probability is about 1 in 65,000.    Wizard, could you please describe the equivalent odds of the California SuperLotto Plus (1 in 41.4 Million), in terms of number of consecutive times of rolling 7 or 11?  I heard it somewhere before.  Most people cannot comprehend the lottery odds.  But, the rolling of dice -- they can relate.  Tim from Belmont, CA   Let n be your answer.  The probability of rolling a 7 or 11 is 8/36.  To solve for n: (8/36) n = 1/41,400,000 log((8/36) n ) = log(1/41,400,000) n × log(8/36) = log(1/41,400,000) n = log(1/41,400,000)/log(8/36) n = -7.617 / -0.65321 n = 11.6608 So there you go, the probability of hitting the SuperLotto is the same as rolling a seven or eleven 11.66 times in a row.  For those who can’t comprehend a partial throw I would rephrase as the probability falls between 11 and 12 consecutive rolls.    We are in a disagreement between workers. there is a bar down the street that has a shake a day. which is you must throw five dice at once and all five must end up being the same "like yahtzee" but he gives you three chance at it. but you must pick up all the dice all three times. so the questions is what’s the odds to do it in one shake and what’s the odds  to do it in the three shakes allowed. Thanks , if you already answered this before i am sorry but i couldt find it.  Dan and co workers at maple island from Forest Lake   The probability of a five-of-a-kind on one throw is 6*(1/6) 5 = 1/1,296.  This is because there are six different five-of-a-kinds (one to six) and the probability each die will be that number is (1/6).  The probability of not getting a five-of-a-kind is 1-(1/1,296)=1,295/1,296.  The probability of going three attempts without a three of a kind is (1,295/1,296) 3 =99.77%.  So the probability of getting at least one five-of-a-kind in three tries is 100%-99.77% = 0.23%.    What is the expected number of tosses required in order to obtain at least one of each of the possible outcomes on an unbiased 6 sided dice?  Michael from Melbourne   If the probability of something is p then on average it will take 1/p trials for it to happen the first time.  Obviously, on the first roll you’ll cross off one number.  The probability of rolling one of the other five numbers next is 5/6.  So it will take on average 1/(5/6)=6/5=1.2 rolls for that to happen.  Following that reasoning to the end, the expected number of rolls is (6/6)+(6/5)+(6/4)+(6/3)+(6/2)+(6/1) = 14.7.    What is the classical probability of getting a total of 12 when 5 balanced dice are rolled?  Kennith H. from Winters   I hope you’re happy, I just added a new section answering questions such as this for 1 to 25 dice.  As the five-dice table shows, the probability of rolling a total of 12 is 0.039223251028807.    Somebody bet he that he could roll a total of 6 and 8, with two dice, before I could roll a total of seven twice.  This seemed like a good bet because seven is the most common total.  However I lost $2500 doing this over and over.  What are the odds?  Anthony from Indiana   I’m afraid you had the square side of this bet.  The probability of rolling two sevens before a six and eight is 45.44%.  Here are all the possible outcomes.  The first column is the order of petintent rolls to the outcome of the bet, ignoring all others.    Two Sevens before Six and Eight Bet   Relavant Rolls  Probability  Formula  Outcome   6,8  0.142045  (5/16)*(5/11)  Lose   8,6  0.142045  (5/16)*(5/11)  Lose   6,7,8  0.077479  (5/16)*(6/11)*(5/11)  Lose   7,6,8  0.053267  (6/16)*(5/16)*(5/11)  Lose   8,7,6  0.077479  (5/16)*(6/11)*(5/11)  Lose   7,8,6  0.053267  (6/16)*(5/16)*(5/11)  Lose   7,7  0.140625  (6/16)*(6/16)  Win   6,7,7  0.092975  (5/16)*(6/11)*(6/11)  Win   8,7,7  0.092975  (5/16)*(6/11)*(6/11)  Win   7,6,7  0.06392  (6/16)*(5/16)*(6/11)  Win   7,8,7  0.06392  (6/16)*(5/16)*(6/11)  Win     Basically, the reason the 6 and 8 is the better side is you can hit those numbers in either order: 6 then 8, or 8 then 6.  With two sevens there is only one order, a 7 and then another 7.    Two questions, please:  1) What is the probability of rolling 6,6,6,6,6,6 @ one time, with (6)6-sided die?  2)What is the probability of rolling 1,2,3,4,5,6 @ one time with (6) 6-sided die?  Thanks!  It’s killing me!  Heather from Petaluma   The probability of six sixes is (1/6) 6 = 1 in 46656.  The  probability of rolling 1,2,3,4,5,6 with six dice is 6 ! /6 6 = 1 in 64.8    What is the probability of getting any given number more than once if you roll a die ten times?  Ryan from Silay   1-(5/6) 10 -10 × (1/6) × (5/6) 9 = 51.55%.    In a game called Taxation and Evasion, a player rolls a pair of dice.  On any roll if the sum is 7,11, or 12, the player gets audited; any other sum they avoid taxes.  If a player rolls the pair 5 times, what is the probability that he avoids taxes?  George P. from Stevens Point, WI   The probability of a 7, 11, or 12 is (6+2+1)/36 = 9/36 = 1/4.  See my section on dice probability basics for how I arrived at that figure. The probability of rolling anything else is 3/4.  The probability of going five rolls without rolling a 7, 11, or 12 is (3/4) 5 = 23.73%.    How many throws of a die does it take before it is likely that you have thrown a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 at least once each? Any ideas on generalizing this for an n-sided die?  Asif from Columbia, SC   Not that you asked, but let me address the mean first.  For a six-sided die, the expected number of throws to get each face at least once is (6/6)+(6/5)+(6/4)+(6/3)+(6/2)+(6/1) = 14.7.  For an n-sided die the expected throws is (n/n) + (n/(n-1)) + (n/(n-2)) + ... + n.  The median number of throws required is 13.  The probability of taking 13 rolls or less is 51.4%, and 13 rolls or more is 56.21%.    I know you’re skeptical of dice control.  I have been practicing dice setting and controlled shooting for 3 months.  What is the probability of throwing 78 sevens over 655 throws randomly?  Thanks for the help :)  Eric B. from Boston, MA   For large numbers of throws we can use the Gaussian Curve approximation.  The expected number of sevens in 655 throws is 655  ×  (1/6) = 109.1667.  The variance is 655 × (1/6) × (5/6) = 90.9722.  The standard deviation is sqr(90.9722) = 9.5379.  Your 78 sevens is 109.1667 − 78 = 31.1667 less than expectation.  This is (31.1667 - 0.5)/9.5379 = 3.22 standard deviations below expectation.  The probability of falling 3.22 or more standard deviations south of expectations is 0.000641, or 1 in 1,560. I got this figure in Excel, using the formula, normsdist(-3.22).    This is about controlling the dice at Craps.  You previously discussed the Stanford Wong Experiment , stating, " The terms of the bet were whether precision shooters could roll fewer than 79.5 sevens in 500 rolls of the dice. The expected number in a random game would be 83.33. The probability of rolling 79 or fewer sevens in 500 random rolls is 32.66%.... The probability of rolling 74 or fewer sevens in 500 random rolls is 14.41%. " The question I have about this bet is that 14.41% still isn’t "statistically significant" [ i.e. p < 0.05 ] , which is usually taken to mean greater than two Standard Deviations from the Mean -- or a probability of less than a *combined* 5% of the event happening randomly on EITHER end of the series. How many Sevens would have to be rolled in 500 rolls before you could say that there is a less than 2.5% chance that the outcome was entirely random (i.e. that the outcome was statistically significant) ? Many Thanks & BTW , yours is ABSOLUTELY the BEST web site on the subject of gambling odds & probabilities that I’ve found .... keep up the good work !!!  Plexus from Warwick, Rhode Island   Thank you for the kind words.  You should not state the probability that the throws were non-random is p.  The way it should be phrased is the probability that a random game would produce such a result is p.  Nobody expected 500 rolls to prove or disprove anything.  It wasn’t I who set the line at 79.5 sevens, but I doubt it was chosen to be statistically significant; but rather, I suspect the it was a point at which both parties would agree to the bet. The 2.5% level of significance is 1.96 standard deviations from expectations.  This can be found with the formula =normsinv(0.025) in Excel.  The standard deviation of 500 rolls is sqr(500*(1/6)*(5/6)) = 8.333.  So 1.96 standard deviations is 1.96 * 8.333 = 16.333 rolls south of expectations.  The expected number of sevens in 500 throws is 500*(1/6) = 83.333.  So 1.96 standard deviations south of that is 83.333 − 16.333 = 67.  Checking this using the binomial distribution, the exact probability of 67 or fewer sevens is 2.627%.    What is the expected number of rolls needed to get a Yahtzee?  Ian F. from Provo   Assuming the player always holds the most represented number, the average is 11.09.  Here is a table showing the distribution of the number of rolls over a random simulation of 82.6 million trials.

If die lands on 1, the player loses $1 and the game ends.  If the die lands on anything else, the player’s wins $1.  At this point the player may let it ride, or quit.  The player may keep playing, doubling each bet, until he loses or quits.  What is the best strategy?  Byron P. from Newington, CT   Speaking only in terms of maximizing expected value, the player should play forever.  While the probability is 1 that the player will eventually lose, at any given decision point the expected value always favors going again.  It seems like a paradox.  The answer lies in the fact that some events have a probability of 1, but still may not happen.  For example, if you threw a dart at a number line from 0 to 10, the probability of not hitting pi exactly is 1, but it still could happen. However, for practical purposes, there is some stopping point.  This is because the happiness money brings is not proportional to the amount.  While it is commonly accepted that more money brings more happiness, the richer you get, the less happiness each additional dollar brings you. I believe a good way to answer this question is to apply the Kelly Criterion to the problem.  According to Kelly, the player should make every decision with the goal of maximizing the expected log of his bankroll after the wager.  To cut to the end of this (I cut out a lot of math), the player should keep doubling until the wager amount exceeds 96.5948% of his total wealth.  Wealth should be defined as the sum of the amount won plus whatever money the player had before he made the first wager.  For example, if the player had $100,000 to start with, he should keep doubling up to 23 times, to a win of $4,194,304.  At that point the player’s total wealth will be $4,294,304.  He will be asked to wager 4,194,304/4,294,304 = 96.67% of his total wealth, which is greater than the 96.5948% stopping point, so he should quit.    Players A and B throw a pair of dice. Player A wins if he throws a total of 6 before B throws a toal of 7, and B wins if he throws 7 before A throws 6.   If A begins, show that A’s chances of winning are 30/61.  Sangeeta from Mumbai, India   Let the answer to this question be called p.  The probability of rolling a total of six is 5/36, and the probability of rolling a total of seven is 6/36.  If you don’t understand why, please see my section on dice probability basics .  We can define p as: p = Prob(6 on first roll) + Prob(no 6 on first roll)*Prob(no 7 on second roll)*p. This is because, if neither player wins after the first two rolls, the game is back to the original state, and the probability of player A winning remains the same. So, we have: p = (5/36) + (31/36)×(30/36)×p p = 5/36 + (930/1296)×p p * (1-(930/1296)) = 5/36. p * (366/1296) = 5/36 p = (5/36)×(1296/366) = 30/61.    How many ways are there to roll n six-sided, non-distinct dice? As stated, the dice are non-distinct, so with five dice, for example, 1-1-3-5-6 and 1-6-5-1-3 would be considered the same roll. With two dice, it’s trivial to determine that the answer is 21, but I can’t figure out an elegant, generalized solution.  Don from New York   The answer can be expressed as combin(n+5,n) = (n+5)!/(120×n!).  Here is the answer for 1 to 20 dice.

Can you calculate what the probability is of two numbers coming up behind each other in a roll of the dice? Meaning what is the probability of two 4’s or two 6’s or two 7’s back to back?  I realize that the past cannot predict the future but is there a way to calculate 7/36 X 7/36 happening back to back?  I hope that makes sence.  James from Birmingham   Sure.  That would be Pr(2) 2 + Pr(3) 2 + ... + Pr(12) 2 = (1/36) 2 + (2/36) 2 + (3/36) 2 +  (4/36) 2 +  (5/36) 2 +  (6/36) 2 +  (5/36) 2 +  (4/36) 2 +  (3/36) 2 +  (2/36) 2 +  (1/36) 2 = 11.27%.    In 180 consecutive rolls of the dice, how many times can I expect to see the following: Two sevens in a row? Three sevens in a row? Four sevens in a row? Thanks for your time :-).  Melanie D. from Elizabeth City, NC   I can’t think of any useful reason to know this information, but I get asked this kind of thing a lot, so I’ll humor you. It is a little easier getting a specified sequence of sevens starting with the first roll, or ending with the last, because the sequence is bounded on one side.  Specifically, the probability of getting a sequence of s sevens, starting with the first roll, or ending with the last, is (1/6) s × (5/6).  The 5/6 term is because you have to get a non-7 at the open end of the sequence. The probability of starting a sequence of s sevens at any point in the middle of the sequence is (1/6) s × (5/6) 2 .  We square the 5/6 term, because the player must get a non-7 on both ends of the sequence.  If there are r rolls, there will be 2 places for an inside sequence, and r-n-1 places for a run of n sevens.  Putting these equations in a table, here is the expected number of runs of sevens, from 1 to 10.  The "inside" column is 2*(5/6)*(1/6) r , and the "outside" column is (179-r)*(5/6) 2 *(1/6) r , where r is the number of sevens in the run.  So, we can expect 3.46 runs of two sevens, 0.57 runs of three sevens, and 0.10 runs of four sevens.    Expected Runs of Sevens in 180 Rolls   Run  Inside  Outside  Total   1  0.277778  20.601852  20.87963   2  0.046296  3.414352  3.460648   3  0.007716  0.565844  0.57356   4  0.001286  0.093771  0.095057   5  0.000214  0.015539  0.015754   6  0.000036  0.002575  0.002611   7  0.000006  0.000427  0.000433   8  0.000001  0.000071  0.000072   9  0  0.000012  0.000012   10  0  0.000002  0.000002       Two dice are rolled until either a total of 12 or two consecutive totals of 7.  What is the probability the 12 is rolled first?  Anonymous   The answer and solution can be found on my companion site, mathproblems.info , problem 201.    I’m a tabletop gamer, and was having some discussion with my friends about non-cubical platonic solid dice (If you’re a big enough nerd, that means d4, d8, d12, and d20).  They argued that those would be the only ones that would be demonstratively fair.  I argued that manufacturing them to be fair would be entirely too difficult.  Also, the only games would be craps variants rendered overly cumbersome due to the number of extra outcomes.  Has any casino ever had a game that used non-traditional six sided dice?  Bayani from Carnagie, PA      This is Lisa Furman, the model from my M casino review .  When I tried to impress her by saying that the balloon figure on the left is a truncated icosahedron , she just smiled and rolled her eyes.   Don’t you dare challenge my math nerd credentials!  When I was a high school sophomore, I constructed not only all the platonic solids with poster board and electricians tape, but all the Archimedean solids as well. If you limit yourself to the regular polygons, and want every face to have the same probability, then you are limited to the platonic solids.  However, if you can lift the regular polygon requirement, then you can add the 13 Catalan solids as well. To answer your other question, no, I have never seen a game actually in a casino that used any dice other than cubes.  About ten years ago I saw a game demonstrated at a gaming show in Atlantic City that I think used a Rhombic triacontahedron , one of the Catalan solids, but I don’t think it ever made it to a casino floor.  There is a game I see year after year at the Global Gaming Expo that uses a spinning top (like a dreidel), but alas, I’ve never seen that in a casino either.    If I roll three six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling a straight and, also, what are the odds of rolling a three of a kind?  Mark from Fargo, ND   There are 6 3 =216 ways to roll three dice.  Six of those combinations will result in a three of a kind (1-1-1 to 6-6-6).  So the probability of a three of a kind is 6/216 = 1/36.  There are four possible spans for a straight (1-2-3 to 4-5-6).  There are also 3!=6 ways to arrange the three dice in a straight.  So, there are 4*6=24 straight combinations.  Thus the probability of a straight is 24/216 = 1/9.    What is the average sum when rolling four six-sided dice after subtracting the lowest result (known as 4d6-L)? What is the standard deviation for this roll?  Aaron from New York   The following table shows the number of combinations for all possible totals from 3 to 18.    Combinations in 4d6-L    Outcome  Combinations   3  1   4  4   5  10   6  21   7  38   8  62   9  91   10  122   11  148   12  167   13  172   14  160   15  131   16  94   17  54   18  21   Total  1296    The mean result is 12.2446, and the standard deviation is 2.8468.    My question is based on dice odds. I know that there are six ways to get 7 and one way to get 12, but what are the chances of getting six 7’s before one 12? Are they even, and if not, how many twelves should be added to the equation to make it an even proposition?  nick   The probability of rolling a 7 is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a 12 is 1/36.  The probability of rolling a 7, given that a roll is a 7 or 12 is (1/6)/((1/6)+(1/36)) = 6/7.  So the probability that the first six times a 6 or 12 is rolled it is a 6 every time is (6/7) 6 = 39.66%. If you rephrase the question to be what is the probability of rolling five 6’s before a 12, then the answer is (6/7) 5 = 46.27%.  With four rolls it is (6/7) 4 = 53.98%.  So there is no number of 7’s before a 12 that is exactly 50/50.  If you’re looking for a good sucker bet, suggest you can either roll four 7’s before a 12, or a 12 before five 7’s. This question was raised and discussed in the forum of my companion site Wizard of Vegas .    Is there an easy way to calculate the probability of throwing a total of t with d 6-sided dice?  Anon E. Mouse   Here is a handy trick, courtesy of Robert Goodhand of Somerset, UK. First put on a row six ones surrounded by five zeros on either side, as follows:    One-Die Probabilities   Dice Total       1  2  3  4  5  6        One Die  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0    This represents the number of combinations for rolling a 1 to 6 with one die. I know, pretty obvious. However, stick with me. For two dice, add another row to the bottom, and for each cell take the sum of the row above and the five cells to the left of it. Then add another five dummy zeros to the right, if you wish to keep going. This represents the combinations of rolling a total of 2 to 12.    Two Dice Probabilities   Dice Total       2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12        One Die  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   Two Dice  0  0  0  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  0  0  0  0    For three dice, just repeat. This will represent the number of combinations of 3 to 18.   Three Dice Probabilities Expand   Dice Total       3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18        One Die  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   Two Dice  0  0  0  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   Three Dice  0  0  0  0  0  1  3  6  10  15  21  25  27  27  25  21  15  10  6  3  1  0  0  0  0  0     To get the probability of any given total, divide the number of combinations of that total by the total number of combinations. In the case of three dice, the sum is 216, which also easily found as 6 3 . For example, the probability of rolling a total of 13 with three dice is 21/216 = 9.72%. So for d dice, you’ll need to work your way up through 1 to d-1 dice. This is very easily accomplished in any spreadsheet.    How many rolls of two dice would it take to have a 50/50 chance of rolling at least one 12?  Maff   That is a classic problem in the history of the field of probability.  Many people incorrectly think the answer is 18, because the probability of a 12 is 1 in 36, and 18×(1/36)=50%.  However, by that logic, the probability of getting a 12 in 36 rolls would be 100%, which clearly it isn’t.  Here is the correct solution.  Let r be the number of rolls.  The probability a roll isn’t a 12 is 35/36.  The probability there are 0 12s in r rolls is (35/36) r .  So we need to solve for r in the following equation: (35/36) r = 0.5 log(35/36) r = log(0.5) r × log(35/36) = log(0.5) r = log(0.5)/log(35/36) r = 24.6051 So there isn’t  a round answer.  The probability of rolling a 12 in 24 rolls is 1-(35/36) 24 = 49.14%. The probability of rolling a 12 in 25 rolls is 1-(35/36) 25 = 50.55%. If you want to make a bet on this, say you can roll a 12 in 25 rolls, or somebody else can’t in 24 rolls.  Either way you’ll have an advantage at even money.    In Dice Wars , what is the probability of success for any given number of attacking and defending dice?  As an attacker, what ratio has the greatest expected gain?  Anonymous   For those unfamiliar with the game, both the attacker and defender will roll 1 to 8 dice, according to how many armies they each have at that point in a battle.  The higher total shall win.  A tie goes to the defender.  If the attacker loses, he will still retain one army in the territory where he initiated the attack.  For this reason, he must have at least two armies to attack, so if he wins one can inhabit the conquered territory and one can stay behind. The following table shows the probability of an attacker victory according to all 64 combinations of total dice.

Anonymous   For the benefit of other readers, a Yahtzee is a five of a kind with five dice.  In the game of Yahtzee the player may hold any dice he wishes and re-roll the rest.  He can do this up to three rolls. The player may re-roll previously held dice, if he wishes.  For example, if the player's first roll is 3-3-4-5-6 and he holds the threes and then has 3-3-5-5-5 after the second roll he may keep the fives and re-roll the threes on his third roll. The following table shows the maximum number of dice of the same face for 1 to 20 rolls.  The table shows the probability of getting a Yahtzee within three rolls is about 4.6%.

I am wondering which will come up more rolling a pair of dice — an odd or even total?  relaxmax   The answer is 50/50.  This will be true for any number of dice rolled, not just two. A bit off-topic, but I've always thought an odd/even set of bets would be a good way to replace the dreaded big 6/8 bets in craps.

This question is raised and discussed in my forum at Wizard of Vegas .    In the Hot Roll bonus, the player wins the following number of coins according to the total of two dice:   2 or 12:	1000 3 or 11:	600 4 or 10:	400 5 or 9:	300 6 or 8:	200 He keeps rolling until he gets a total of seven, which ends the bonus.  If he rolls a seven on the first roll, then he gets a consolation prize of 700 coins.  What is the average coins won per bonus?  Anonymous   The average number of rolls is the inverse of the bonus-ending event, which has a probability of 1/6, so the player will roll six times on average.  However, the last roll will be the seven, so an average of five winning rolls per bonus. Next, here is the probability of each total, assuming no seven:   2 or 12:	1/30 3 or 11:	2/30 4 or 10:	3/30 5 or 9:	4/30 6 or 8:	5/30 So, the average win per roll, assuming no seven, is 2*[(1/30)*1000 + (2/30)*600 + (3/30)*400 + (4/30)*300 + (5/30)*200] = 373.33. The value of the consolation prize is (1/6)*700 = 116.67. Thus, the average bonus win is 116.67 + 5×373.33 = 1983.33.

The casinogenerally pays you less than true odds, which is how they make a profit. But the Free Odds bets are paid at the actual true odds and thereforecarry no house edge — which is why you should put most of your craps money on theFree Odds bets. In this article Bill Burton explains what True Odds are. Understanding Dice Odds Last time I discussed the basics of playing craps. In order to play the game youobviously need dice. You also need an understanding of the dice and the odds andprobabilities of rolling the numbers. In the movies you will see the players picking up the dice and rolling them togetherin both hands before letting them fly down the table as they scream, “Baby needsa new pair of shoes!” or some other wild chant. This is fine in the movies but ina real casino you are only allowed to handle the dice with one hand. Dice are actuallyprecision instruments manufactured to very strict specifications. They are inspectedfor any flaws such as nicks or chips before being put in to play. Rubbing them togetheror other rough handling can damage dice. If the dice are thrown off the table theyhave to be checked before being put back into play. The average life of a pair ofdice is only about eight hours, and then the casino replaces them to ensure thatthe game dice are fresh and fair. Let’s take a look the dice. They’re cubes, about three quarters of an inch square.One alone is called a die. Each die has spots called “pips” totaling a number fromone to six on each side. If you add the corresponding sides you will get the numberseven. The side with six pips will have one pip on the opposite side. Two and fiveare on corresponding sides as are the three and four. Since each die has six sidesand the game is played with two dice, there are 36 (6 x 6) combinations that canbe made giving totals of two through twelve. Take a look at the Dice Chart: You will see that there is only one way to make the numbers two (1 and 1) and twelve(6 and 6). There are two ways to make the number three: (2 and 1) and (1 and 2).If it helps you to understand the combinations, picture a blue and a red die. Youcould have number one on the red and two on the blue, or number two on the red andnumber one on the blue. There are two ways to make the three and eleven. There are three ways to make the four and ten. There are four ways to make the five and nine. There are five ways to make the six and eight. There are six ways to make the seven. By knowing how the numbers are made, you can calculate the odds of making any numberbefore the seven is rolled. Since the number 7 can be rolled six ways, you dividethe number six by the number of ways a number is rolled.   Number  # ways to roll  True Odds    4  3  2 to 1    5  4  3 to 2    6 or 8  5  6 to 5    9  4  3 to 2    10  3  2 to 1   Once you understand the odds and probabilities of the dice, you are on your wayto mastering the game of craps.

A standard die has six sides with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If the die is fair (and we will assume that all of them are), then each of these outcomes are equally likely. Since there are six possible outcomes, the probability of obtaining any side of the die is 1/6. Thus the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6 and so on for 3, 4, 5 and 6.         But what happens if we add another die? What are the probabilities for rolling two dice? What Not to Do To correctly determine the probability of an event we need to know two things.  First, how often the event occurs.  Then second divide the number of outcomes in the event by the total number of outcomes in the sample space . Where most go wrong is to miscalculate the sample space. Their reasoning runs something like this: “We know that each die has six sides. We have rolled two dice , and so the total number of possible outcomes must be 6 + 6 = 12.” Although this explanation was straightforward, it is unfortunately incorrect. It’s plausible that going from one die to two should cause us to add six to itself and get 12, but this comes from not thinking carefully about the problem. A Second Attempt Rolling two fair dice more than doubles the difficulty of calculating probabilities. This is because rolling one die is independent of rolling a second one.   One roll has no effect on the other one. When dealing with independent events we use the multiplication rule . The use of a tree diagram demonstrates that there are really 6 x 6 =36 outcomes from rolling two dice. To think about this, suppose that the first die we roll comes up as a 1. The other die could be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.         Now suppose that the first die is a 2. The other die again could be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. We have already found 12 potential outcomes, and have yet to exhaust all of the possibilities of the first die. A table of all 36 of the outcomes are in the table below. Sample Problems With this knowledge we can calculate all sorts of two dice probability problems. A few follow: Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is seven? Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is three? Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the numbers on the dice are different? Three (Or More) Dice The same principle applies if we are working on problems involving three dice . We multiply and see that there are 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 outcomes. As it gets cumbersome to write the repeated multiplication, we can use exponents to simplify our work. For two dice there are 6 2 outcomes. For three dice there are 6 3 outcomes. In general, if we roll n dice, then there are a total of 6 n outcomes.

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

and the Laws of Probability   by  Edward
D. Collins   For more questions and problems regarding dice (and coin)
probabilities, please see this page.           Let's
imagine you are playing a game which uses dice.  You are about to roll
three of them. You NEED to roll at least one 6. A 6 appearing on
any one (or more) of the three dice will win the game for you! What are
your chances?    33.3
%    42.1
%    50
%    66.6
%    Quite
some time ago, I was over at a friend's house watching him and another
friend play a board game called Axis & Allies. At one point this exact scenario came up - Kent was planning on rolling
three dice and really wanted at least one 6 to appear. He made a comment that with three
dice, his chances were 3 / 6 or 50%.  Kent's
reasoning was, with one die, the chances of rolling a 6 were 1 / 6 which is correct. He
also believed if he were to roll two dice, his chances were double this
or 2 / 6. This is INCORRECT and
this is where his faulty reasoning begins.  Knowing
a little bit about the laws of probability, I quickly knew the fraction
"2 / 6" for two dice and "3/6" for 
		three dice was incorrect and spent a brief moment computing and then 
		explaining the true percentages.  Unfortunately, I do not
believe I was successful in explaining to Kent why my figures were
correct. Maybe I can do so here.  Obviously,
with Kent's logic above, if the chances of rolling a 6 with two dice is
2 / 6 and the chances of
rolling a 6 with three dice is 3/6, then the chances of rolling a 6
with six dice would be 6 / 6 !!   100%?? Of course, this is obviously
incorrect. I don't care how many dice you roll, the chances of rolling
a 6 will never be 100%.  When
you roll just one die, there are six different ways the die can land,
as shown by the following graphic:                 When
two dice are rolled, there are now 36 different and unique ways the
dice can come up. This figure is arrived at by multiplying the number
of ways the first die can come up (six) by the number of ways the
second die can come up (six). 6 x 6 = 36.  This
graphic shows this very nicely. I've used two different colored dies to
help show a roll of 2-1 is different from a roll of 1-2.                     If
you use the above graphic and count the number of times is 6 appears
when two dice are rolled, you will see the answer is eleven. Eleven
times out of 36 or 30.5 %, slightly less than the 33.3% (2 / 6) Kent thought. When
you roll two dice, you have a 30.5 % chance at least one 6 will appear.  This
figure can also be figured out mathematically, without the use of the
graphic. One way to do so is to take the number of ways a single die
will NOT show a 6 when rolled (five) and multiply this by the number of
ways the second die will NOT show a 6 when rolled. (Also five.) 5 x 5 =
25. Subtract this from the total number of ways two dice can appear
(36) and we have our answer...eleven.  So,
let's use this same method to answer our question and determine the
chances of at least one 6 appearing when three dice
are rolled.  Take
the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the first die...   5 / 6   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the second die...   5 / 6 x 5 / 6 = 25 / 36   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the third die...   25 / 36 x 5 / 6 = 125 / 216   So,
there are 125 out of 216 chances of a 6 NOT appearing when three dice
are rolled. Simply subtract 125 from 216 which will give us the chances
a 6 WILL appear when three dice are rolled, which is 91. 91 out of 216
or 42.1 %, not quite the 50% Kent originally thought.  Here
is a table showing the fractions and percentages of a 6 appearing (or
any other single digit for that matter) and not appearing with several different numbers of dice:                     Chances

when you roll nine dice, rolling a 6 is far from a certainty - you
have just a little better than 80 % chance of rolling this 6. This
means, on the average, even when you roll nine dice, two times out of
ten you will not roll a single 6!  Hope

 solids and Archimedean duals the obvious
 choices. The die can be "rolled" by throwing it in the air and allowing
 it to come to rest on one of its faces. Dice are used in many games of chance as
 a way of picking random numbers on which to bet,
 and are used in board or role-playing games to determine the number of spaces to
 move, results of a conflict, etc. A coin can be viewed
 as a degenerate 2-sided case of a die.  In 1787, Mozart wrote the measures and instructions for a musical composition dice game. The idea is to cut and paste pre-written measures of music together to create a Minuet (Chuang).   The most common type of die is a six-sided cube with the numbers 1-6 placed on the faces. The value of the roll is indicated by the number
 of "spots" showing on the top. For the six-sided die, opposite faces are
 arranged to always sum to seven. This gives two possible mirror
 image arrangements in which the numbers 1, 2, and 3 may be arranged in a clockwise
 or counterclockwise order about a corner. Commercial dice may, in fact, have either
 orientation. The illustrations above show 6-sided dice with counterclockwise and
 clockwise arrangements, respectively, when viewed from along the three-fold rotation
 axis towards the center of the die.  The cube has the nice property that there is an upward-pointing face opposite the bottom face from which the value of the "roll" can easily
 be read. This would not be true, for instance, for a tetrahedral die, which would have to be picked up and turned over to reveal the number underneath
 (although it could be determined by noting which number 1-4 was not visible
 on one of the upper three faces). The arrangement of spots corresponding to a roll
 of 5 on a six-sided die is called the quincunx . There
 are also special names for certain rolls of two six-sided dice: two 1s are called snake eyes and two 6s are called Boxcars .  Shapes of dice other than the usual 6-sided cube are commercially available from companies such as Dice & Games, Ltd.® Diaconis and Keller
 (1989) show that there exist "fair" dice other than the usual Platonic
 solids and duals of the Archimedean solids ,
 where a fair die is one for which its symmetry group acts transitively on its faces
 (i.e., isohedra ). There are 30 isohedra.  The probability of obtaining points (a roll of ) on  -sided dice can
 be computed as follows. The number of ways in which can be obtained
 is the coefficient of in     (1)     since each possible arrangement contributes one term. can be written
 as a multinomial series     (2)   (3)    so the desired number is the coefficient of in     (4)     Expanding,     (5)     so in order to get the coefficient of , include all

For six-sided dice,     (17)     and    (18)   (19)   (20)   (21)    For three six-sided dice, the most common rolls are 10 and 11, both with probability 1/8; and the least common rolls are 3 and 18, both with probability 1/216.  For four six-sided dice, the most common roll is 14, with probability 73/648; and the least common rolls are 4 and 24, both with probability 1/1296.  In general, the likeliest roll for  -sided dice is given
 by     (22)     which can be written explicitly as     (23)     For 6-sided dice, the likeliest rolls are given by     (24)     or 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, ... for , 3, ... (OEIS A030123 ) dice. The probabilities corresponding

 to approach a normal distribution as the number

What are the most likely outcomes from rolling a pair of dice?  Assuming we have a standard six-sided die, the odds of rolling a particular value are 1/6. There is an equal probability of rolling each of the numbers 1-6. But, when we have two dice, the odds are not as simple. For example, there's only one way to roll a two (snake eyes), but there's a lot of ways to roll a seven (1+6, 2+5, 3+4).  Let's count how many ways there are to get each value, 2 through 12:    Outcome  List of Combinations  Total    2  1+1  1    3  1+2, 2+1  2    4  1+3, 2+2, 3+1  3    5  1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1  4    6  1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1  5    7  1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1  6    8  2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 6+2  5    9  3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3  4    10  4+6, 5+5, 6+4  3    11  5+6, 6+5  2    12  6+6  1    If we want to calculate the probability of rolling, say, a five, we need to divide the number of ways to get 5 by the total possible combinations of two dice.  How many total combinations are possible from rolling two dice? Since each die has 6 values, there are \(6*6=36\) total combinations we could get. If you add up the numbers in the total column above, you'll get 36.  So, we can calculate the probabilities of each outcome:    Outcome  Probability    2  1/36 = 2.78%    3  2/36 = 5.56%    4  3/36 = 8.33%    5  4/36 = 11.11%    6  5/36 = 13.89%    7  6/36 = 16.67%    8  5/36 = 13.89%    9  4/36 = 11.11%    10  3/36 = 8.33%    11  2/36 = 5.56%    12  1/36 = 2.78%               © 2017 Free Math Help. All rights reserved.                Rolling Two Dice  When rolling two dice, distinguish between them in some way:  a first
one and second one, a left and a right, a red and a green, etc.  Let
(a,b) denote a possible outcome of rolling the two die, with a the
number on the top of the first die and b the number on the top of the second
die.  Note that each of a and b can be any of the integers from 1 through 6.
Here is a listing of all the joint possibilities for (a,b):    (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)   Note that there are 36 possibilities for (a,b).  This total number of possibilities can be obtained from the multiplication principle :  there are 6 possibilities for a, and for each outcome for a, there are 6 possibilities for b.  So,
the total number of joint outcomes (a,b) is 6 times 6 which is 36.  The set of
all possible outcomes for (a,b) is called the sample space of this probability experiment.  With the sample space now identified, formal probability theory requires
that we identify the possible events .
These are always subsets of the
sample space, and must form a sigma-algebra.  In an example such as this,
where the sample space is finite because it has only 36 different outcomes,
it is perhaps easiest to simply declare ALL subsets of the sample space to
be possible events.  That will be a sigma-algebra and avoids what might
otherwise be an annoying technical difficulty.  We make that declaration
with this example of two dice.  With the above declaration, the outcomes where the sum of the two
dice is equal to 5 form an event.
If we call this event E, we have E={(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)}. Note that we have listed all the ways a first die and second die add
up to 5 when we look at their top faces.  Consider next the probability of E, P(E).  Here we need more information.
If the two dice are fair and independent , each possibility (a,b) is equally likely.  Because there are
36 possibilities in all, and the sum of their probabilities must equal
1, each singleton event {(a,b)} is assigned probability equal to 1/36.
Because E is composed of 4 such distinct singleton events, P(E)=4/36=
1/9.  In general, when the two dice are fair and independent, the probability
of any event is the number of elements in the event divided by 36.  What if the dice aren't fair, or aren't independent of each other?
Then each outcome {(a,b)} is assigned a probability (a number in [0,1])
whose sum over all 36 outcomes is equal to 1.  These probabilities aren't
all equal, and must be estimated by experiment or inferred from other
hypotheses about how the dice are related and and how likely each number
is on each of the dice.  Then the probability of an event such as E
is the sum of the probabilities of the singleton events {(a,b)} that make
up E.      Go to the home page for Tom Ramsey    Go to the home page for the UHM Department of Mathemati

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up

Just wanted to double check :) – FiguringItOut  Dec 8 '13 at 22:55        4      It's easier to calculate the probability that you roll no 6's, which is ${(\dfrac{5}{6}})^2 = 25/36$, leaving $11/36$ probability that you roll at least one. – NovaDenizen  Dec 8 '13 at 22:56         add a comment |           5 Answers 5     active  oldest  votes            up vote  16  down vote      That's right. The easier approach would be to calculate the chance of not rolling a $6$ - that's just $\frac56$ for the first die, and $\frac56$ for the second die, so by the product rule (as the events are independent), the probability is $\frac56 \cdot \frac56 = \frac{25}{36}$.  Then the probability of rolling a $6$ is $1$ minus the probability of not rolling a $6$, which we just calculated: so it is $1-\frac{25}{36}=\frac{11}{36}$.  If calculating the probability of an event not occurring to calculate the probability of it occurring feels weird to you, you might want to read up on complementary events . The idea here is that the product rule can sometimes make probabilities smaller when that wouldn't make any sense --- in our example, if you had just multiplied $\frac16 \cdot \frac16 = \frac1{36}$, then that would've been obviously wrong. This is because when we work with probability, we're dealing with quantities in the $[0,1]$ interval, so multiplication usually makes things smaller, rather than larger.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 8 '13 at 23:02       Newb   13k 9 35 72                  So, then is rolling one or two in two tries 20/36 a little under 60%? – jwize  Aug 9 '15 at 7:00        add a comment |             up vote  6  down vote      Yes indeed, you've got them all. So counting them, we get $11$ of the possible $36$ outcomes of which at least one $6$  is rolled.

One die rolls a 6.  What is the probability of rolling a double 6?  One solution is to say that P(2 sixes) = $\frac{1}{6}$ since the first die gives a 6, so the only way to get a double six is by rolling a six on the other die (which has a 1 in 6 chance).  Another solution is to say that there are 11 possible combinations if one die rolls a six i.e. (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) and (6, 1). So the probability of rolling a double six if one six has already been rolled is $\frac{1}{11}$.

You have rolled a six. Now for a double-six, you need to get a 6 on the
second roll. The second roll is independent of the first. So the probability
of a 6 again on the second roll is $1/6.$  If both dice have already been rolled out of your sight, and you are
told that there is at least one 6, then conditional on that information, what is the probability that the dice actually show a double-6. Then the analysis
of @Shayne2020 (+1) leading to the answer $1/11$ is correct.      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 28 '17 at 0:46             answered Oct 27 '17 at 22:55       BruceET   29.6k 5 14 39              add a comment |             up vote  5  down vote      This can be phrased as   Given that at least one die rolls a 6, what is the probability of rolling a double 6?   We can use the conditional probability formula:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\ \mathrm{and}\ B)}{P(B)}$$
This means "the probability of event A given event B, is the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B".  \begin{align}
P(\mathrm{double\ 6}|\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6}) &= \frac{P(\mathrm{double\ 6}\ \mathrm{and}\ \mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}{P(\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}\\
&= \frac{P(\mathrm{double\ 6})}{P(\mathrm{at\ least\ one\ 6})}\\
&= \frac{1/36}{11/36}\\
&= \frac{1}{11}

This doesn't clarify which one. Was it the first die or the second one? (Note that the dice are distinguishable by the turn of their throws.)  So, the latter logic is correct. The conditional probability reduces the sample space $S$ into ${(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) (6, 1)}$  Now, $|S|= 11$  And the only favorable outcome (rolling two 6's ) is $(6,6)$.

I was pretty sure that for any specific outcome, you treat each die roll as an independent event and multiply the probabilities, and I saw some other answers on this site that confirm this.  So the odds of getting exactly one 1 would be:  (1)   (not 1) (not 1)  (1/6) (5/6)   (5/6)  11.57%  And then you add the probabilities of the different outcomes (exactly one 1, two 1s, three 1s), which, using the method above, give me:  11.57%  2.31%  0.46%  But 14.34% is a smaller chance than of rolling a 1 with one die (16.67%).  How do my odds of rolling a 1 decrease with more dice?  What am I doing wrong?    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Jan 29 '16 at 20:42       user309154   3 3              1      Your not taking combinations into account. One way to roll a single 1 is to roll 1-2-3, yet another is to roll 2-1-3. Your calculation $\frac{1}{6}\frac{5}{6}\frac{5}{6}$ needs to be multiplied by the number of combinations. – Wintermute  Jan 29 '16 at 20:48        add a comment |           4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  0  down vote  accepted      The issue you are having is that (1)(not 1)(not 1) is calculating the probability that the first dice is a 1, and the second and third dices are not. This is not the only way to get just one 1, it could either be 1st, 2nd or 3rd and hence we have three ways and we multiply by 3, i.e P(one 1)=3*(1/6) (5/6) (5/6)=75/216.  Similiarly, with two 1's, you've calculated the probability that the first and second are 1 and the third is not (1)(1)(not 1). There are three ways that one of the dice aren't 1 and so we multiply by 3 to get 3*(1/6) (1/6) (5/6)=15/216.  The probability that all are 1 is .46% or 1/216 and when we add them altogether we have 91/216 or 42.129%.  However, the easier way to calculate this question is to ask the following, the chance of me getting at least one 1, is the same as the chance of me no 1's. The chance of getting no 1's is (5/6) (5/6) (5/6)= 125/216 and so the chance of you getting no 1's is 1-(125/216)=91/216=42.129%.  If you are wondering how to get the 3's when the question is more complicated, they are the coefficients in the relevant line of the binomial expansion, each to the right of the the minimal value you require (in your case you wanted at least one, the relevant line is 1 3 3 1 and so you count from the second giving 3,3,1) This is because the three rolls are Bernoulli trials, making this experient a binomial one.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 29 '16 at 21:00       Dan Barry   362 1 9              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      The easiest way to figure out odd for events with the words "at least" is often to figure out the contrary.
So here the contrary is : "you have no 1 on any of your 3 dice" and this probality is easy to figure out. It is : $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3=\frac{125}{216}$  So the probality of your event is : $1-\frac{125}{216}=\frac{91}{216}$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 29 '16 at 20:51       stity   2,990 3 12              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Exactly one 1 is not equivalent to the specific result (1,0,0) as you're calculating it. Because exactly 1 also includes (0,1,0) and (0,0,1). Similarly for two 1's. So you should multiply both of those probabilities with $3$. Note that your distribution here is the binomial distribution and you're missing the binomial part in its definition.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 29 '16 at 20:47       joedoe8585   722 2 10              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Let $X$ be the number of 1's rolled.  Your initial calculation $P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{216}$ gives you the probability of rolling exactly one 1 on the first die; you need to multiply this by 3 to account for possibly rolling a 1 on the second die or third die. While we can apply a similar procedure to accurately calculate $P(X = 2)$, then calculate $P(X \geq 1) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)$, it's easier to proceed by realizing that $P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)$; we just need to calculate the odds of rolling no 1's, then subtract that from 1.  \begin{align}
P(X = 0) &= (\frac{5}{6})^{3} = \frac{125}{216} \\
\\
P(X \geq 1) &= 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216} \\
\\
&\approx 42.1\%

You want to find the probability that die 1 rolls a six ($p = \frac 16$) while die 2 rolls anything else ($p = \frac 56$) OR vice versa.  The first case is simply $p = \frac 16 \cdot \frac 56 = \frac {5}{36} $.  The second case is simply the mirror of the first, with the same probability.

An example of what i am looking of is rolling a 4+ on a D6 and the odds on rolling a 5+ on a D6 but you get to reroll it once if its not 5+.  By calculating there probability i can see which has a higher chance of happening.  How does the reroll affect the probability ?
How would multiple dice afffect the probability, say i was rolling three dice instead of one ?  I have lots of other scenerions the involve rerolling so it would be best if you could explain the method rather than just give me a a formula.  A formula answering my question would be great but it would bb better if i could understand it myself so i dont have to keep asking similar questions on here.    probability  dice     share | cite | improve this question     asked Aug 28 '13 at 13:56       Skeith   106 1 1 3              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote      The probability that you roll 4+ is the probability that you roll a 4, a 5, or a 6.  Each of these events has probability $\frac{1}{6}$; so, the probability of rolling 4+ is $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$.  For your other scenario, note that the event that you get a 5+ when you are allowed on re-roll can be broken up in to two disjoint events: event $A$, in which you roll a 5+ on the first try; and event $B$, in which you roll a number 1-4 on your first attempt, and either a 5 or 6 on the second.  Then $P(A)=\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$, since this is the event that you roll either a 5 or a 6.  For $B$, we have
$$
P(B)=\frac{4}{6}\cdot\frac{2}{6}=\frac{2}{9},
$$
since you must roll a 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the first attempt and either a 5 or 6 on the second. So, overall, the probability of getting 5+ when you allow one re-roll is 
$$
P(A\text{ or }B)=P(A)+P(B)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{9}=\frac{5}{9}.
$$
(Note that we have used here that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint possibilities.)  So, you are more likely to get a 5+ with a re-roll allowed than to get a 4+ with no re-roll.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 28 '13 at 14:05       Nick Peterson   24.8k 2 34 55                  Does the amount of dice rolled effect the probability for instance if you were rolling two dice, would i just add the probabilities together ? – Skeith  Aug 28 '13 at 14:13            If you are rolling two dice, and they are independent -- that is, the outcome of one roll does not change the probabilities of specific outcomes of the second -- then you multiply the probabilities. – Nick Peterson  Aug 28 '13 at 16:22        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Assuming a fair six sided dice  The probability of rolling a 4 or more (4, 5 or 6) from a single roll is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ as there a three winning results and 6 possibilities.  The probability of rolling a 5 or more (5 or 6) from a single roll is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$ as there a two winning results and 6 possibilities.  The probability of rolling a 5 or more (5 or 6) if two rolls are allowed is $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3}= \frac{5}{9}$ This is the probability of getting a 5 or more on the first roll plus the probability that you don't get a 5 or more of the first roll (so get to roll again) times the probability of getting a 5 or more on the second roll.  Note : the probability of getting at least one 5 or 6 would be the same $\frac{5}{9}$ If you rolled both dice at the same time.  The probability that the first dice is 5 or more plus the probability that you need to look at the second dice times the probability its 5 or more.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Aug 28 '13 at 14:16             answered Aug 28 '13 at 14:10       Warren Hill   2,574 9 21              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Ok so in general, say we have 1 roll. Obviously we have a 1 in 6 chance to roll any number. But think of total number of possibilities. There's only 6 possibilities here. Keep that in mind.  Now roll two dice. We have 36 possibilities. 3 dice 216 possibilities...etc. One thing that might help you understand probability with dice is say we roll 6 dice and want to know the probabilty of rolling a six. Many people think...mistakenly...well, if it's a 1 in 6 chance to roll a 6 on each die, then there is a 100% probability of rolling a 6! Well, that's actually wrong. Since there are $46,656$ possible outcomes, and $5^6 = 15,625$ do not have a 6, well then the probability is only $\frac{46,656 - 15,625}{46,656} = 66.5%$. Now I think you may have a better understanding.  For answering your specific question I think Warren Hill does a good job in his answer above.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 28 '13 at 14:10       Spaderdabomb   304 1 9                  Erm.... not sure this anything to do with the question. – Simon Hayward  Aug 28 '13 at 14:11            He asked to be helped to understand any scenario.

and the Laws of Probability   by  Edward
D. Collins   For more questions and problems regarding dice (and coin)
probabilities, please see this page.           Let's
imagine you are playing a game which uses dice.  You are about to roll
three of them. You NEED to roll at least one 6. A 6 appearing on
any one (or more) of the three dice will win the game for you! What are
your chances?    33.3
%    42.1
%    50
%    66.6
%    Quite
some time ago, I was over at a friend's house watching him and another
friend play a board game called Axis & Allies. At one point this exact scenario came up - Kent was planning on rolling
three dice and really wanted at least one 6 to appear. He made a comment that with three
dice, his chances were 3 / 6 or 50%.  Kent's
reasoning was, with one die, the chances of rolling a 6 were 1 / 6 which is correct. He
also believed if he were to roll two dice, his chances were double this
or 2 / 6. This is INCORRECT and
this is where his faulty reasoning begins.  Knowing
a little bit about the laws of probability, I quickly knew the fraction
"2 / 6" for two dice and "3/6" for 
		three dice was incorrect and spent a brief moment computing and then 
		explaining the true percentages.  Unfortunately, I do not
believe I was successful in explaining to Kent why my figures were
correct. Maybe I can do so here.  Obviously,
with Kent's logic above, if the chances of rolling a 6 with two dice is
2 / 6 and the chances of
rolling a 6 with three dice is 3/6, then the chances of rolling a 6
with six dice would be 6 / 6 !!   100%?? Of course, this is obviously
incorrect. I don't care how many dice you roll, the chances of rolling
a 6 will never be 100%.  When
you roll just one die, there are six different ways the die can land,
as shown by the following graphic:                 When
two dice are rolled, there are now 36 different and unique ways the
dice can come up. This figure is arrived at by multiplying the number
of ways the first die can come up (six) by the number of ways the
second die can come up (six). 6 x 6 = 36.  This
graphic shows this very nicely. I've used two different colored dies to
help show a roll of 2-1 is different from a roll of 1-2.                     If
you use the above graphic and count the number of times is 6 appears
when two dice are rolled, you will see the answer is eleven. Eleven
times out of 36 or 30.5 %, slightly less than the 33.3% (2 / 6) Kent thought. When
you roll two dice, you have a 30.5 % chance at least one 6 will appear.  This
figure can also be figured out mathematically, without the use of the
graphic. One way to do so is to take the number of ways a single die
will NOT show a 6 when rolled (five) and multiply this by the number of
ways the second die will NOT show a 6 when rolled. (Also five.) 5 x 5 =
25. Subtract this from the total number of ways two dice can appear
(36) and we have our answer...eleven.  So,
let's use this same method to answer our question and determine the
chances of at least one 6 appearing when three dice
are rolled.  Take
the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the first die...   5 / 6   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the second die...   5 / 6 x 5 / 6 = 25 / 36   and
multiply this by the chances of a 6 NOT appearing on the third die...   25 / 36 x 5 / 6 = 125 / 216   So,
there are 125 out of 216 chances of a 6 NOT appearing when three dice
are rolled. Simply subtract 125 from 216 which will give us the chances
a 6 WILL appear when three dice are rolled, which is 91. 91 out of 216
or 42.1 %, not quite the 50% Kent originally thought.  Here
is a table showing the fractions and percentages of a 6 appearing (or
any other single digit for that matter) and not appearing with several different numbers of dice:                     Chances

you have just over a 50 % chance (51.77) of rolling at least one 6 when
rolling four dice. With six dice it's just over 66 %. Also notice even
when you roll nine dice, rolling a 6 is far from a certainty - you
have just a little better than 80 % chance of rolling this 6. This
means, on the average, even when you roll nine dice, two times out of
ten you will not roll a single 6!  Hope

Rolling Two Dice  When rolling two dice, distinguish between them in some way:  a first
one and second one, a left and a right, a red and a green, etc.  Let
(a,b) denote a possible outcome of rolling the two die, with a the
number on the top of the first die and b the number on the top of the second
die.  Note that each of a and b can be any of the integers from 1 through 6.
Here is a listing of all the joint possibilities for (a,b):    (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)   Note that there are 36 possibilities for (a,b).  This total number of possibilities can be obtained from the multiplication principle :  there are 6 possibilities for a, and for each outcome for a, there are 6 possibilities for b.  So,
the total number of joint outcomes (a,b) is 6 times 6 which is 36.  The set of
all possible outcomes for (a,b) is called the sample space of this probability experiment.  With the sample space now identified, formal probability theory requires
that we identify the possible events .
These are always subsets of the
sample space, and must form a sigma-algebra.  In an example such as this,
where the sample space is finite because it has only 36 different outcomes,
it is perhaps easiest to simply declare ALL subsets of the sample space to
be possible events.  That will be a sigma-algebra and avoids what might
otherwise be an annoying technical difficulty.  We make that declaration
with this example of two dice.  With the above declaration, the outcomes where the sum of the two
dice is equal to 5 form an event.
If we call this event E, we have E={(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)}. Note that we have listed all the ways a first die and second die add
up to 5 when we look at their top faces.  Consider next the probability of E, P(E).  Here we need more information.
If the two dice are fair and independent , each possibility (a,b) is equally likely.  Because there are
36 possibilities in all, and the sum of their probabilities must equal
1, each singleton event {(a,b)} is assigned probability equal to 1/36.
Because E is composed of 4 such distinct singleton events, P(E)=4/36=
1/9.  In general, when the two dice are fair and independent, the probability
of any event is the number of elements in the event divided by 36.  What if the dice aren't fair, or aren't independent of each other?
Then each outcome {(a,b)} is assigned a probability (a number in [0,1])
whose sum over all 36 outcomes is equal to 1.  These probabilities aren't
all equal, and must be estimated by experiment or inferred from other
hypotheses about how the dice are related and and how likely each number
is on each of the dice.  Then the probability of an event such as E
is the sum of the probabilities of the singleton events {(a,b)} that make
up E.      Go to the home page for Tom Ramsey    Go to the home page for the UHM Department of Mathemati

Anthony Bradshaw/Getty Images      Rolling two six-sided dice is common in many of the most popular board games, including Monopoly , Backgammon and The Settlers of Catan. Even if you don't memorize the percentages in the chart below, it's helpful to have a general sense of how common each roll is. When it is your turn and you are two spaces away from landing on an opponent's hotel in Monopoly, this probability chart may comfort you.         Dice Roll Probability The chance of rolling a total of 2 is 2.78 percent The chance of rolling a total of 3 is 5.56 percent The chance of rolling a total of 4 is 8.33 percent The chance of rolling a total of 5 is 11.11 percent The chance of rolling a total of 6 is 13.89 percent The chance of rolling a total of 7 is 16.67 percent The chance of rolling a total of 8 is 13.89 percent The chance of rolling a total of 9 is 11.11 percent The chance of rolling a total of 10 is 8.33 percent The chance of rolling a total of 11 is 5.56 percent The chance of rolling a total of 12 is 2.78 percent There's only one combination that yields a total of 2—when each die displays a 1. Likewise, there is only one combination that yields a total of 12—when each die displays a 6. They are the least likely combinations to occur. As you can see, 7 is the most common roll with two six-sided dice. You are six times more likely to roll a 7 than a 2 or a 12, which is a huge difference.   You are twice as likely to roll a 7 as you are to roll a 4 or a 10. However, it's only 1.2 times more likely that you'll roll a 7 than a 6 or an 8. Another way of looking at these numbers is that, over time, you will roll one 4 or 10 for every two 7s rolled. You'll see six 7s for every 2 or 12. Of course, dice have a bad habit of defying expectations, so don't rely on probabilities from a chart like this to work out your game strategy.         You're likely to find yourself on the losing end of a game if you do.

First lets look at the possibilities of the total of two dice. The table below shows the six possibilities for die 1 along the left column and the six possibilities for die 2 along the top column. The body of the table shows the sum of die 1 and die 2.   Two Dice Totals    Die 1  Die 2    1  2  3  4  5  6    1  2  3  4  5  6  7    2  3  4  5  6  7  8    3  4  5  6  7  8  9    4  5  6  7  8  9  10    5  6  7  8  9  10  11    6  7  8  9  10  11  12      The colors of the body of the table illustrate the number of ways to throw each total. The probability of throwing any given total is the number of ways to throw that total divided by the total number of combinations (36). In the following table the specific number of ways to throw each total and the probability of throwing that total is shown.      Total  Number of Combinations  Probability    2  1  2.78%    3  2  5.56%    4  3  8.33%    5  4  11.11%    6  5  13.89%    7  6  16.67%    8  5  13.89%    9  4  11.11%    10  3  8.33%    11  2  5.56%    12  1  2.78%    Total  36  100%      The following shows the probability of throwing each total in a chart format. As the chart shows the closer the total is to 7 the greater is the probability of it being thrown.   The Field Bet Example  Now that we understand the probability of throwing each total we can apply this information to the dice games in the casinos to calculate the house edge. For example consider the field bet in craps . This bet pays 1:1 (even money) if the next throw is a 3, 4, 9, 10, or 11, 2:1 (double the bet) on the 2, and 3:1 (triple the bet) on the 12. Note that there are 7 totals that win and only 4 that lose which might cause someone who didn't know better to think it was a good gamble.  The player's return can be defined as the sum of the products of the probability of each event and the net return of that event. The following table shows each possible total, the net return, the probability of throwing that total, and the average return. The average return is the product of the net return and the probability. The player's return is the sum of the average returns.      Total  Net Return  Probability  Average Return    2  2  0.0278  0.0556    3  1  0.0556  0.0556    4  1  0.0833  0.0833    5  -1  0.1111  -0.1111    6  -1  0.1389  -0.1389    7  -1  0.1667  -0.1667    8  -1  0.1389  -0.1389    9  1  0.1111  0.1111    10  1  0.0833  0.0833    11  1  0.0556  0.0556    12  3  0.0278  0.0834    Total   1  -0.0278      The last row shows the player's return to be -.0278, in other words for every $1 bet the player can expect to lose 2.78 cents. The player's loss is the house's gain so the house edge is the product of -1 and the player's return, in this case 0.0278 or 2.78%.  For the probabilities in the sum of more than two dice please see my probabilities for 1 to 25 dice section.

Jeff B. from Miami, Florida   The answer is 6*(1/6) 6 = 6/46,656 = 1/7,776 =~ 0.0001286 .     What is the average number of rolls until a shooter "sevens out"? I know that a 7 will appear every 6 rolls, but with come-out 7-11s and craps, plus the possibility of shooters making multiple points, I think the average number of rolls may be higher than expected. Is there any mathematical reference material on this?  Grshooter from Kansas City, Missouri   The average number of rolls per shooter is 8.525510.  For the probability of exactly 2 to 200 rolls, please see my craps probability of survival page .     What are the odds (and frequency) in 100,000 rolls of the dice (craps/dont pass line) of losing a DP bet 2x’s.3x’s 4x’s 5x’s 6x’s 7x’s 8x’s or 9x’s in a row.  Derick from Minneapolis, USA   My craps appendix shows how to work out the odds for any one bet. There you will see the probability of losing the don’t pass bet is 2928/5940. The probability of losing n bets in a row is (2928/5940) n . The frequency in 100,000 of losing exactly n can be closely approximated as 100,000 * (2928/5940) n+2 .     What are the odds of rolling the same number with six dice in one roll?  Kyle Hill from Colstrip, Montana   The odds of getting six of the same number with six dice is 6*(1/6) 6 =1/7776 =~ 0.01286%.     How often can you roll a pair of dice 28 times without getting a 7? How do you figure this? Congratulation on your site, it’s great.  Arturo G. from Mexico City, Mexico   Thanks for the compliment. I take it you mean what is the probability of rolling a pair of dice 28 times without getting a 7. The probability of not rolling a 7 on any one roll is 5/6. The probability of not rolling a 7 in 28 rolls is (5/6) 28 = 0.006066, or about 1 in 165.     Just a question about an Oriental dice game, where the players are supposed to guess which side of the die shows up. The players will first place their bets on 1,2,3,4,5,6 (like roulette) and then the "dealer" will roll 3 dice simultaneously. Payouts are 1:1 if the chosen numbers shows up once (on any of the 3 dice), 2:1 if the chosen no shows up twice, and 3:1 if the chosen number appears on all 3 dice. As the player can place any number of bets of the board, what will be the optimum number of bets to place? (assuming all my bets are equal in size)  Jansen from Toronto, Canada   The probability of three matching is 1/216. The probability of two matching is 3*5/216. The probability of one matching is 25*5/216. The probability of 0 matching is 5*5*5/216. So the expected return is 3*(1/216)+2*(15/216)+1*(75/216)-1*(125/216)=-17/216=-7.87%. There is no optimal number of bets, you will give up an expected 7.87% of total money bet no matter what you do. These bets can be made in both sic bo and chuck a luck .     Mr. Wizard, what is the probability of rolling two pair when rolling four dice?  Brian from St. Catherines, Canada   There are combin(6,2)=15 different sets of pairs possible. There are combin (4,2)=6 ways the dice can roll any specific two pair. There are 6^4=1296 ways to roll four dice. So the probability is 90/1296=6.9444%.     If I roll a die, my probability of rolling a six is 1/6. If I roll two dice, does my probability of rolling a six on one of them increase, or does it stay at 1/6?  Mike R. from Rosemount   If you rolled x dice the probability of getting at least one 6 is 1-(5/6) 2 . In the case of two dice this is 30.56%.     How many different ways are there of rolling 3 ones using 6 dice?  Jamie from Croydon, England   First there are combin (6,3)=20 ways you can choose three dice out of 6 for the three ones. Then each of the other three can be any of five numbers. So, the total ways are 20×5 3 =2500. The total number of ways to throw all the dice are 6 6 =46,656, so the probability of rolling exactly three ones is 2500/46656=0.0536. For help with the combin function see my probabilities in poker section.     What is the probability of any one die showing ONE when 3 dice are throw together. My understanding is it should be 50% chance (1/6+1/6+1/6=1/2 -->50%) But in your odds table it shown 34.72%. Please help.  John C. from Singapore   The probability of rolling exactly one one with three dice is 3*(5/6) 2 *(1/6) = 75/216 = 34.72%.     What is the probability of rolling a "pair" when tossing 4 dice?  Anthony from Toronto, Canada   The pair can be any one of 6 numbers. The other two singletons can be among the other five. So there are 6*combin(5,2)=60 combinations already. There are combin(4,2)=6 combinations of dice on which the pair can appear. The two singletons can be arrange in two ways. So there are 60*12=720 ways to throw a pair. The total number of all ways to throw the dice is 6 4 =1296. So the probability is 720/1296 =~ 55.56%.     My friend owns a bar and has a "shake of the day" where there are ten dice in a Tupperware container, what are the odds of matching 8 out of the 10 in one shake. Thank you for your time.  August from Oshkosh, USA   The probability that if you roll 10 dice and exactly 8 numbers are the same is 6*combin(10,8)*(1/6) 8 *(5/6) 2 = 1/8957.952. The probability of matching at least 8 is 6*[combin(10,8)*(1/6) 8 *(5/6) 2 + combin(10,9)*(1/6) 9 *(5/6) + (1/6) 10 ] = 1/8569.469.     I recently rolled, during a game of backgammon, double sixes four consecutive times. What are the odds of this happening again?  David from Sunland, USA   With every new roll the probability the next four rolls will be all double sixes is (1/36) 4 = 1 in 1679616.     What is the probability of getting a straight by a single throw of 5 dice?  Teodoro C. Deocares from Dagupan, Philippines   There are two possible spans: 1 to 5 and 2 to 6. Each of these spans can be ordered in 5!=120 ways. There are 6 5 = 7776 ways to roll five dice. So the probability is 2*120/7776 = 3.09%. The probability of this seems to be much higher right after I put mark 0 for large straight during a game of Yahtzee.     A fair sided die is rolled 30 times. What is the expected number of times that number 1 will come up? What is the probability that number 1 will come up it’s expected number of times?  Anonymous   The expected number of ones is 30*(1/6) = 5. The probability of exactly 5 ones is combin(30,5)*(1/6) 5 *(5/6) 25 = 19.21%.     If I have any give number of dice what is the probability that if I roll them all of them at least one will land on a one?  Anonymous   The probability that all the dice will not be a one is (5/6) n . So the probability of at least one 1 is 1-(5/6) n . Let’s take an example of five dice. The answer would be 1-(5/6) 5 = 59.81%.     If I throw 36 dice what is the probability of getting at least one six?  Anonymous   1-(5/6) 36 = 99.86%     If I kept throwing and removed all the sixes each time, how would I predict the theoretical number of dice remaining after a particular number of throws?  Anonymous   Each roll the expectation is that 5/6 of the dice will remain. So the expected number of dice remaining after n throws would be 36*(5/6) n . For example after 10 throws you would have 5.81 dice left, on average.     If I roll three dice, what is the probability of getting at least two numbers the same?  Anonymous   The probability all numbers will be different is (5/6)*(4/6)=20/36. So the probability at least two numbers will be the same is 1-(20/36) = 16/36 = 44.44%.     If two people throw a pair of dice, What is the probability that it is the same number? Is there a formula to figure this out?  Anonymous   Yes. You simply run through all total from 2 to 12 and determine the probability of rolling each twice. So the answer would be (1/36) 2 +(2/36) 2 +(3/36) 2 +(4/36) 2 +(5/36) 2 +(6/36) 2 +(5/36) 2 +(4/36) 2 +(3/36) 2 +(2/36) 2 +(1/36) 2 = 11.27%.     I recently attended a hospital fete. There was a new car as a prize if 7 dice produced 7 sixes in one throw. £1.00 a go. Odds on this must be high but how high?  Anonymous   The probability of throwing seven sixes with seven dice is (1/6) 7 = 1 in 279,936. So the car would have to have a value of £279,936 or more for this to be a good bet. Even your average Rolls Royce is not worth this much, so I would say that was a terrible bet. [Bluejay adds: Uh, yeah, but I think the point was that it was for charity. What’s more fun: Donating £1.00 to charity and getting nothing back but the good feeling of helping out, or donating £1.00 and getting the good feeling plus the longshot chance of winning a car?]     What are the probabilities for a 5 of a kind, 4 of a kind, 3 of a kind, full house, 2 pair, pair, straight, and nothing with the roll of five dice?  Anonymous    Five of a kind: 6/6 5 = 0.08% (obvious)  Four of a kind: 5*6*5 = 1.93% (five possible positions for the singleton * 6 ranks for the four of a kind * 5 ranks for the singleton).  Full house: combin(5,3)*6*5/6 5 = 3.86% (combin(5,3) positions for the three of a kind * 6 ranks for the three of a kind * 2 ranks for the pair).  Three of a kind: COMBIN(5,3)*COMBIN(2,1)*6*COMBIN(5,2) / 6 5 = 15.43%. (combin(5,3) positions for the three of a kind * combin(2,1) positions for the larger of the singletons * 6 ranks of the three of a kind * combin(5,2) ranks for the two singletons.  Two pair: COMBIN(5,2)*COMBIN(3,2)*COMBIN(6,2)*4 / 6 5 = 23.15% (combin(5,2) positions for the higher pair * combin(3,2) positions for the lower pair * combin(6,4) ranks for the two pair * 4 ranks for the singleton.  Pair: COMBIN(5,2)*fact(3)*6*combin(5,3) / 6 5 = 46.30% (combin(5,2) positions for the pair * fact(3) positions for the three singletons * 6 ranks for the pair * combin(5,3) ranks for the singletons.  Straight: 2*fact(5) / 6 5 = 3.09% (2 spans for the straight {1-5 or 2-6} * fact(5) ways to arrange the order). Nothing: ((COMBIN(6,5)-2)*FACT(5)) / 6 5 = 6.17% (combin(6,5) ways to choose 5 ranks out of six, less 2 for the straights, * fact(5) ways to arrange the order.      Hi Wizard, I wanted to know if you can answer this. In a popular gambling game in 17th century France, a player would roll a pair of dice 24 times. He would win his bet if at least one of these rolls was a double six. There was a debate at the time over whether the probability of winning was above or below an even 50%. Can you help me?  Anonymous   Sure, this is easy. The probability of rolling at least one 12 in 24 rolls is 1-(35/36) 24 = 49.14%. So the odds favor betting against a 12. This is a clever bet because the expected number of twelves in 24 rolls is 2/3. However that does not mean the probability of a 12 is 2/3, because sometimes there will be more than one 12, and the player betting on 12 doesn’t win any more for extra twelves after the first one. If the probability of winning any given trial is p, the number of trials is n, and the probability of at least one win is w then solving for n in terms of p and w gives us... w=1-(1-p) n 1-w = (1-p) n log(1-w) = log((1-p) n ) log(1-w) = n*log(1-p) n= log(1-w)/log(1-p)  So in your example n = log(1-.5) / log(1-(1/36)) = log(0.5) / log(35/36) = 24.6051. So if the probability of success is 50% in 24.6 rolls it must be slightly less in 24 rolls.     What is the probability of rolling 1,2,3,4,5,6 with six dice, six times in a row?  Anonymous   The probability of rolling 123456 with six dice in a single roll can be expressed as prob(second die does not match first die) * prob(third die does not match first or second die) * ... = 1*(5/6)*(4/6)*(3/6)*(2/6)*(1/6) = 0.015432. So the probability of doing this six times in a row is 0.015432 6 = 1 in 74,037,208,411.     If I roll a single die 6 times, what is the probability of getting a "2" exactly 4 times?  Anonymous   Combin(6,2)*(1/6) 4 *(5/6) 2 = 0.008037551.     What is the probability of rolling 13 or more with 3, 4, and 5 dice, if you are allowed to keep the highest three dice in your roll?  Anonymous   Here are the probabilities: 3 dice: 25.93% 4 dice: 48.77% 5 dice: 66.13%.     Suppose we roll three fair six-sided dice.  What’s the conditional probability that the first dice shows 4, given that the sum of the three numbers showing is 12?  Shikha from North Ryde   The probability of A given B is the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B.  In this case the probability of rolling a 4 on the first die and then a total of 8 on the other two is (1/6)*(5/36) = 5/216.  The probability of rolling any total of 12 with 3 dice is 25/216, as shown in my sic bo section.  So the answer is (5/216)/(25/216) = 5/25 = 20%.     In a recent programming exercise myself and other students were asked to describe a six-sided die in code, and then use our dice to determine play simple game. The object of the game was to roll the dice until the sum of the tosses reached exactly 100. Any toss that put the total over 100 would not be added and merely added to statistics. Quickly it was determined that 17 throws would be the least amount of throws needed to reach 100. However calculating the odds of that occurring has proved elusive. Calculating the odds of a specific sequence of throws is rather straight forward, but how might one factor in both non-specific ordering of throws, and the different ways of reaching 100 in 17 throws (16*6 + 1*4 and 15*6 + 2*5)?  from   The two ways you mention are the only ways to throw a total of 100 in 17 throws.  The probability of throwing 16 sixes and one four is 17*(1/6) 17 .  There are 17 possible positions of the 4 and each sequence has a probability of (1/6)*(1/6)*...*(1/6) with 17 terms.  The number of ways to get 15 sixes and 2 fives is combin (17,2) = 136.  So the probability of 15 sixes and 2 fives is 136*(1/6) 17 .  So the total probability is (17+136)*(1/6) 17 . = 1 in 110,631,761,077.     There are 3 dice, 2 are proper six sided dice, while one is a die with all sides containing a six. All the dice are in my pocket. I randomly take out a die and throw it.  The result is a 6.  What is the probability that the die was one of the proper dice with 6 different values?  Annojh from Toronto   Let A = Choosing the normal die Let B = Rolling a 6 with randomly chosen die Answer = Pr(A given B) = Pr(A and B)/pr(B) = ((2/3)*(1/6))/((2/3)*(1/6)+(1/3)*1) = (2/18)/((2/18)+(6/18)) = 1/4.     If you can roll six dice only once, what is the probability of rolling 6,6,6,6,1, and 4 in any order?  Aubrey from Kokomo   There are 6!/(4!*1!*1!) = 30 ways to arrange these numbers in any order.  Another way to look at it is there are 6 positions to put the 1, and 5 left to put the 4, so 6*5=30.  The probability of getting 666614 in exactly that order is 1 in 6 6 = 1 in 46656.  Multiply that by 30 for the 30 possible orders and the answer is 30/46656 = 0.0643%, or 1 in 1552.2.     My understanding of "wait time" for an event is the reciprocal of the probability of that event.  I’m interested in calculating the wait time to roll consecutive 2s using one die.  In a simulation I get 42 rolls on average.  How do I make the connection with the probability of rolling consecutive 2s?  Lee from Andover   It is true that for single events if the probability is p then the average wait time is 1/p.  However it gets more complicated with consecutive events.  Let x be the state that the last roll was not a two.  This is also the state at the beginning.  Let y be the state that the last roll was a two.  After the first roll there is a 5/6 chance we will still be in state x, and 1/6 chance we will be in state y.  Let Ex(x) be the expected number of rolls from state x, and Ex(y) the expected number from state y.  Then... Ex(x) = 1 + (5/6)*ex(x) + (1/6)*ex(y), and Ex(y) = 1 + (5/6)*ex(x) Solving for these two equations... Ex(x) = 1 + (5/6)*ex(x) + (1/6)*( 1 + (5/6)*Ex(x)) Ex(x) = 7/6 + (35/36)*Ex(x) (1/36)*Ex(x) = 7/6 Ex(x) = 36*(7/6) = 42 So the average wait time for two consecutive twos is 42 rolls. I have the same type of problem, only the expected flips to get two heads, in my site of math problems , see problem 128.     Can you tell me the odds of rolling two of the same number with two dice, three dice, and four dice?  I am wondering how many dice would one have to roll at one time so that the odds are on the side of the person rolling the dice. (It does not make any difference which number is doubled.)  Mary from Minneapolis, MN   Here is the probability of getting at least one number more than once according to the number of rolls:  Probability of a Pair or More    Rolls  Probability   2 rolls  16.67%   3 rolls  44.44%   4 rolls  72.22%   5 rolls  90.74%   6 rolls  98.46%     What is the chance of getting a sum over 100, when rolling 20 dice? Kind regards  Terje from Stockholm   I started to use the Normal approximation to solve this, but the probability of over 100 points is too low for that method to be accurate.  So I did a random simulation of 8.25 million trials and the number of trails that were 101 points or more was 127.  So the probability is about 1 in 65,000.    Wizard, could you please describe the equivalent odds of the California SuperLotto Plus (1 in 41.4 Million), in terms of number of consecutive times of rolling 7 or 11?  I heard it somewhere before.  Most people cannot comprehend the lottery odds.  But, the rolling of dice -- they can relate.  Tim from Belmont, CA   Let n be your answer.  The probability of rolling a 7 or 11 is 8/36.  To solve for n: (8/36) n = 1/41,400,000 log((8/36) n ) = log(1/41,400,000) n × log(8/36) = log(1/41,400,000) n = log(1/41,400,000)/log(8/36) n = -7.617 / -0.65321 n = 11.6608 So there you go, the probability of hitting the SuperLotto is the same as rolling a seven or eleven 11.66 times in a row.  For those who can’t comprehend a partial throw I would rephrase as the probability falls between 11 and 12 consecutive rolls.    We are in a disagreement between workers. there is a bar down the street that has a shake a day. which is you must throw five dice at once and all five must end up being the same "like yahtzee" but he gives you three chance at it. but you must pick up all the dice all three times. so the questions is what’s the odds to do it in one shake and what’s the odds  to do it in the three shakes allowed. Thanks , if you already answered this before i am sorry but i couldt find it.  Dan and co workers at maple island from Forest Lake   The probability of a five-of-a-kind on one throw is 6*(1/6) 5 = 1/1,296.  This is because there are six different five-of-a-kinds (one to six) and the probability each die will be that number is (1/6).  The probability of not getting a five-of-a-kind is 1-(1/1,296)=1,295/1,296.  The probability of going three attempts without a three of a kind is (1,295/1,296) 3 =99.77%.  So the probability of getting at least one five-of-a-kind in three tries is 100%-99.77% = 0.23%.    What is the expected number of tosses required in order to obtain at least one of each of the possible outcomes on an unbiased 6 sided dice?  Michael from Melbourne   If the probability of something is p then on average it will take 1/p trials for it to happen the first time.  Obviously, on the first roll you’ll cross off one number.  The probability of rolling one of the other five numbers next is 5/6.  So it will take on average 1/(5/6)=6/5=1.2 rolls for that to happen.  Following that reasoning to the end, the expected number of rolls is (6/6)+(6/5)+(6/4)+(6/3)+(6/2)+(6/1) = 14.7.    What is the classical probability of getting a total of 12 when 5 balanced dice are rolled?  Kennith H. from Winters   I hope you’re happy, I just added a new section answering questions such as this for 1 to 25 dice.  As the five-dice table shows, the probability of rolling a total of 12 is 0.039223251028807.    Somebody bet he that he could roll a total of 6 and 8, with two dice, before I could roll a total of seven twice.  This seemed like a good bet because seven is the most common total.  However I lost $2500 doing this over and over.  What are the odds?  Anthony from Indiana   I’m afraid you had the square side of this bet.  The probability of rolling two sevens before a six and eight is 45.44%.  Here are all the possible outcomes.  The first column is the order of petintent rolls to the outcome of the bet, ignoring all others.    Two Sevens before Six and Eight Bet   Relavant Rolls  Probability  Formula  Outcome   6,8  0.142045  (5/16)*(5/11)  Lose   8,6  0.142045  (5/16)*(5/11)  Lose   6,7,8  0.077479  (5/16)*(6/11)*(5/11)  Lose   7,6,8  0.053267  (6/16)*(5/16)*(5/11)  Lose   8,7,6  0.077479  (5/16)*(6/11)*(5/11)  Lose   7,8,6  0.053267  (6/16)*(5/16)*(5/11)  Lose   7,7  0.140625  (6/16)*(6/16)  Win   6,7,7  0.092975  (5/16)*(6/11)*(6/11)  Win   8,7,7  0.092975  (5/16)*(6/11)*(6/11)  Win   7,6,7  0.06392  (6/16)*(5/16)*(6/11)  Win   7,8,7  0.06392  (6/16)*(5/16)*(6/11)  Win     Basically, the reason the 6 and 8 is the better side is you can hit those numbers in either order: 6 then 8, or 8 then 6.  With two sevens there is only one order, a 7 and then another 7.    Two questions, please:  1) What is the probability of rolling 6,6,6,6,6,6 @ one time, with (6)6-sided die?  2)What is the probability of rolling 1,2,3,4,5,6 @ one time with (6) 6-sided die?  Thanks!  It’s killing me!  Heather from Petaluma   The probability of six sixes is (1/6) 6 = 1 in 46656.  The  probability of rolling 1,2,3,4,5,6 with six dice is 6 ! /6 6 = 1 in 64.8    What is the probability of getting any given number more than once if you roll a die ten times?  Ryan from Silay   1-(5/6) 10 -10 × (1/6) × (5/6) 9 = 51.55%.    In a game called Taxation and Evasion, a player rolls a pair of dice.  On any roll if the sum is 7,11, or 12, the player gets audited; any other sum they avoid taxes.  If a player rolls the pair 5 times, what is the probability that he avoids taxes?  George P. from Stevens Point, WI   The probability of a 7, 11, or 12 is (6+2+1)/36 = 9/36 = 1/4.  See my section on dice probability basics for how I arrived at that figure. The probability of rolling anything else is 3/4.  The probability of going five rolls without rolling a 7, 11, or 12 is (3/4) 5 = 23.73%.    How many throws of a die does it take before it is likely that you have thrown a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 at least once each? Any ideas on generalizing this for an n-sided die?  Asif from Columbia, SC   Not that you asked, but let me address the mean first.  For a six-sided die, the expected number of throws to get each face at least once is (6/6)+(6/5)+(6/4)+(6/3)+(6/2)+(6/1) = 14.7.  For an n-sided die the expected throws is (n/n) + (n/(n-1)) + (n/(n-2)) + ... + n.  The median number of throws required is 13.  The probability of taking 13 rolls or less is 51.4%, and 13 rolls or more is 56.21%.    I know you’re skeptical of dice control.  I have been practicing dice setting and controlled shooting for 3 months.  What is the probability of throwing 78 sevens over 655 throws randomly?  Thanks for the help :)  Eric B. from Boston, MA   For large numbers of throws we can use the Gaussian Curve approximation.  The expected number of sevens in 655 throws is 655  ×  (1/6) = 109.1667.  The variance is 655 × (1/6) × (5/6) = 90.9722.  The standard deviation is sqr(90.9722) = 9.5379.  Your 78 sevens is 109.1667 − 78 = 31.1667 less than expectation.  This is (31.1667 - 0.5)/9.5379 = 3.22 standard deviations below expectation.  The probability of falling 3.22 or more standard deviations south of expectations is 0.000641, or 1 in 1,560. I got this figure in Excel, using the formula, normsdist(-3.22).    This is about controlling the dice at Craps.  You previously discussed the Stanford Wong Experiment , stating, " The terms of the bet were whether precision shooters could roll fewer than 79.5 sevens in 500 rolls of the dice. The expected number in a random game would be 83.33. The probability of rolling 79 or fewer sevens in 500 random rolls is 32.66%.... The probability of rolling 74 or fewer sevens in 500 random rolls is 14.41%. " The question I have about this bet is that 14.41% still isn’t "statistically significant" [ i.e. p < 0.05 ] , which is usually taken to mean greater than two Standard Deviations from the Mean -- or a probability of less than a *combined* 5% of the event happening randomly on EITHER end of the series. How many Sevens would have to be rolled in 500 rolls before you could say that there is a less than 2.5% chance that the outcome was entirely random (i.e. that the outcome was statistically significant) ? Many Thanks & BTW , yours is ABSOLUTELY the BEST web site on the subject of gambling odds & probabilities that I’ve found .... keep up the good work !!!  Plexus from Warwick, Rhode Island   Thank you for the kind words.  You should not state the probability that the throws were non-random is p.  The way it should be phrased is the probability that a random game would produce such a result is p.  Nobody expected 500 rolls to prove or disprove anything.  It wasn’t I who set the line at 79.5 sevens, but I doubt it was chosen to be statistically significant; but rather, I suspect the it was a point at which both parties would agree to the bet. The 2.5% level of significance is 1.96 standard deviations from expectations.  This can be found with the formula =normsinv(0.025) in Excel.  The standard deviation of 500 rolls is sqr(500*(1/6)*(5/6)) = 8.333.  So 1.96 standard deviations is 1.96 * 8.333 = 16.333 rolls south of expectations.  The expected number of sevens in 500 throws is 500*(1/6) = 83.333.  So 1.96 standard deviations south of that is 83.333 − 16.333 = 67.  Checking this using the binomial distribution, the exact probability of 67 or fewer sevens is 2.627%.    What is the expected number of rolls needed to get a Yahtzee?  Ian F. from Provo   Assuming the player always holds the most represented number, the average is 11.09.

If die lands on 1, the player loses $1 and the game ends.  If the die lands on anything else, the player’s wins $1.  At this point the player may let it ride, or quit.  The player may keep playing, doubling each bet, until he loses or quits.  What is the best strategy?  Byron P. from Newington, CT   Speaking only in terms of maximizing expected value, the player should play forever.  While the probability is 1 that the player will eventually lose, at any given decision point the expected value always favors going again.  It seems like a paradox.  The answer lies in the fact that some events have a probability of 1, but still may not happen.  For example, if you threw a dart at a number line from 0 to 10, the probability of not hitting pi exactly is 1, but it still could happen. However, for practical purposes, there is some stopping point.  This is because the happiness money brings is not proportional to the amount.  While it is commonly accepted that more money brings more happiness, the richer you get, the less happiness each additional dollar brings you. I believe a good way to answer this question is to apply the Kelly Criterion to the problem.  According to Kelly, the player should make every decision with the goal of maximizing the expected log of his bankroll after the wager.  To cut to the end of this (I cut out a lot of math), the player should keep doubling until the wager amount exceeds 96.5948% of his total wealth.  Wealth should be defined as the sum of the amount won plus whatever money the player had before he made the first wager.  For example, if the player had $100,000 to start with, he should keep doubling up to 23 times, to a win of $4,194,304.  At that point the player’s total wealth will be $4,294,304.  He will be asked to wager 4,194,304/4,294,304 = 96.67% of his total wealth, which is greater than the 96.5948% stopping point, so he should quit.    Players A and B throw a pair of dice. Player A wins if he throws a total of 6 before B throws a toal of 7, and B wins if he throws 7 before A throws 6.   If A begins, show that A’s chances of winning are 30/61.  Sangeeta from Mumbai, India   Let the answer to this question be called p.  The probability of rolling a total of six is 5/36, and the probability of rolling a total of seven is 6/36.  If you don’t understand why, please see my section on dice probability basics .  We can define p as: p = Prob(6 on first roll) + Prob(no 6 on first roll)*Prob(no 7 on second roll)*p. This is because, if neither player wins after the first two rolls, the game is back to the original state, and the probability of player A winning remains the same. So, we have: p = (5/36) + (31/36)×(30/36)×p p = 5/36 + (930/1296)×p p * (1-(930/1296)) = 5/36. p * (366/1296) = 5/36 p = (5/36)×(1296/366) = 30/61.    How many ways are there to roll n six-sided, non-distinct dice? As stated, the dice are non-distinct, so with five dice, for example, 1-1-3-5-6 and 1-6-5-1-3 would be considered the same roll. With two dice, it’s trivial to determine that the answer is 21, but I can’t figure out an elegant, generalized solution.  Don from New York   The answer can be expressed as combin(n+5,n) = (n+5)!/(120×n!).  Here is the answer for 1 to 20 dice.

Can you calculate what the probability is of two numbers coming up behind each other in a roll of the dice? Meaning what is the probability of two 4’s or two 6’s or two 7’s back to back?  I realize that the past cannot predict the future but is there a way to calculate 7/36 X 7/36 happening back to back?  I hope that makes sence.  James from Birmingham   Sure.  That would be Pr(2) 2 + Pr(3) 2 + ... + Pr(12) 2 = (1/36) 2 + (2/36) 2 + (3/36) 2 +  (4/36) 2 +  (5/36) 2 +  (6/36) 2 +  (5/36) 2 +  (4/36) 2 +  (3/36) 2 +  (2/36) 2 +  (1/36) 2 = 11.27%.    In 180 consecutive rolls of the dice, how many times can I expect to see the following: Two sevens in a row? Three sevens in a row? Four sevens in a row? Thanks for your time :-).  Melanie D. from Elizabeth City, NC   I can’t think of any useful reason to know this information, but I get asked this kind of thing a lot, so I’ll humor you. It is a little easier getting a specified sequence of sevens starting with the first roll, or ending with the last, because the sequence is bounded on one side.  Specifically, the probability of getting a sequence of s sevens, starting with the first roll, or ending with the last, is (1/6) s × (5/6).  The 5/6 term is because you have to get a non-7 at the open end of the sequence. The probability of starting a sequence of s sevens at any point in the middle of the sequence is (1/6) s × (5/6) 2 .  We square the 5/6 term, because the player must get a non-7 on both ends of the sequence.  If there are r rolls, there will be 2 places for an inside sequence, and r-n-1 places for a run of n sevens.  Putting these equations in a table, here is the expected number of runs of sevens, from 1 to 10.  The "inside" column is 2*(5/6)*(1/6) r , and the "outside" column is (179-r)*(5/6) 2 *(1/6) r , where r is the number of sevens in the run.  So, we can expect 3.46 runs of two sevens, 0.57 runs of three sevens, and 0.10 runs of four sevens.    Expected Runs of Sevens in 180 Rolls   Run  Inside  Outside  Total   1  0.277778  20.601852  20.87963   2  0.046296  3.414352  3.460648   3  0.007716  0.565844  0.57356   4  0.001286  0.093771  0.095057   5  0.000214  0.015539  0.015754   6  0.000036  0.002575  0.002611   7  0.000006  0.000427  0.000433   8  0.000001  0.000071  0.000072   9  0  0.000012  0.000012   10  0  0.000002  0.000002       Two dice are rolled until either a total of 12 or two consecutive totals of 7.  What is the probability the 12 is rolled first?  Anonymous   The answer and solution can be found on my companion site, mathproblems.info , problem 201.    I’m a tabletop gamer, and was having some discussion with my friends about non-cubical platonic solid dice (If you’re a big enough nerd, that means d4, d8, d12, and d20).  They argued that those would be the only ones that would be demonstratively fair.  I argued that manufacturing them to be fair would be entirely too difficult.  Also, the only games would be craps variants rendered overly cumbersome due to the number of extra outcomes.  Has any casino ever had a game that used non-traditional six sided dice?  Bayani from Carnagie, PA      This is Lisa Furman, the model from my M casino review .  When I tried to impress her by saying that the balloon figure on the left is a truncated icosahedron , she just smiled and rolled her eyes.   Don’t you dare challenge my math nerd credentials!  When I was a high school sophomore, I constructed not only all the platonic solids with poster board and electricians tape, but all the Archimedean solids as well. If you limit yourself to the regular polygons, and want every face to have the same probability, then you are limited to the platonic solids.  However, if you can lift the regular polygon requirement, then you can add the 13 Catalan solids as well. To answer your other question, no, I have never seen a game actually in a casino that used any dice other than cubes.  About ten years ago I saw a game demonstrated at a gaming show in Atlantic City that I think used a Rhombic triacontahedron , one of the Catalan solids, but I don’t think it ever made it to a casino floor.  There is a game I see year after year at the Global Gaming Expo that uses a spinning top (like a dreidel), but alas, I’ve never seen that in a casino either.    If I roll three six-sided dice, what are the odds of rolling a straight and, also, what are the odds of rolling a three of a kind?  Mark from Fargo, ND   There are 6 3 =216 ways to roll three dice.  Six of those combinations will result in a three of a kind (1-1-1 to 6-6-6).  So the probability of a three of a kind is 6/216 = 1/36.  There are four possible spans for a straight (1-2-3 to 4-5-6).  There are also 3!=6 ways to arrange the three dice in a straight.  So, there are 4*6=24 straight combinations.  Thus the probability of a straight is 24/216 = 1/9.    What is the average sum when rolling four six-sided dice after subtracting the lowest result (known as 4d6-L)? What is the standard deviation for this roll?  Aaron from New York   The following table shows the number of combinations for all possible totals from 3 to 18.    Combinations in 4d6-L    Outcome  Combinations   3  1   4  4   5  10   6  21   7  38   8  62   9  91   10  122   11  148   12  167   13  172   14  160   15  131   16  94   17  54   18  21   Total  1296    The mean result is 12.2446, and the standard deviation is 2.8468.    My question is based on dice odds. I know that there are six ways to get 7 and one way to get 12, but what are the chances of getting six 7’s before one 12? Are they even, and if not, how many twelves should be added to the equation to make it an even proposition?  nick   The probability of rolling a 7 is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a 12 is 1/36.  The probability of rolling a 7, given that a roll is a 7 or 12 is (1/6)/((1/6)+(1/36)) = 6/7.  So the probability that the first six times a 6 or 12 is rolled it is a 6 every time is (6/7) 6 = 39.66%. If you rephrase the question to be what is the probability of rolling five 6’s before a 12, then the answer is (6/7) 5 = 46.27%.  With four rolls it is (6/7) 4 = 53.98%.  So there is no number of 7’s before a 12 that is exactly 50/50.  If you’re looking for a good sucker bet, suggest you can either roll four 7’s before a 12, or a 12 before five 7’s. This question was raised and discussed in the forum of my companion site Wizard of Vegas .    Is there an easy way to calculate the probability of throwing a total of t with d 6-sided dice?  Anon E. Mouse   Here is a handy trick, courtesy of Robert Goodhand of Somerset, UK. First put on a row six ones surrounded by five zeros on either side, as follows:    One-Die Probabilities   Dice Total       1  2  3  4  5  6        One Die  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0    This represents the number of combinations for rolling a 1 to 6 with one die. I know, pretty obvious. However, stick with me. For two dice, add another row to the bottom, and for each cell take the sum of the row above and the five cells to the left of it. Then add another five dummy zeros to the right, if you wish to keep going. This represents the combinations of rolling a total of 2 to 12.    Two Dice Probabilities   Dice Total       2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12        One Die  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   Two Dice  0  0  0  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  0  0  0  0    For three dice, just repeat. This will represent the number of combinations of 3 to 18.   Three Dice Probabilities Expand   Dice Total       3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18        One Die  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   Two Dice  0  0  0  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   Three Dice  0  0  0  0  0  1  3  6  10  15  21  25  27  27  25  21  15  10  6  3  1  0  0  0  0  0     To get the probability of any given total, divide the number of combinations of that total by the total number of combinations. In the case of three dice, the sum is 216, which also easily found as 6 3 . For example, the probability of rolling a total of 13 with three dice is 21/216 = 9.72%. So for d dice, you’ll need to work your way up through 1 to d-1 dice. This is very easily accomplished in any spreadsheet.    How many rolls of two dice would it take to have a 50/50 chance of rolling at least one 12?  Maff   That is a classic problem in the history of the field of probability.  Many people incorrectly think the answer is 18, because the probability of a 12 is 1 in 36, and 18×(1/36)=50%.  However, by that logic, the probability of getting a 12 in 36 rolls would be 100%, which clearly it isn’t.  Here is the correct solution.  Let r be the number of rolls.  The probability a roll isn’t a 12 is 35/36.  The probability there are 0 12s in r rolls is (35/36) r .  So we need to solve for r in the following equation: (35/36) r = 0.5 log(35/36) r = log(0.5) r × log(35/36) = log(0.5) r = log(0.5)/log(35/36) r = 24.6051 So there isn’t  a round answer.  The probability of rolling a 12 in 24 rolls is 1-(35/36) 24 = 49.14%. The probability of rolling a 12 in 25 rolls is 1-(35/36) 25 = 50.55%. If you want to make a bet on this, say you can roll a 12 in 25 rolls, or somebody else can’t in 24 rolls.  Either way you’ll have an advantage at even money.    In Dice Wars , what is the probability of success for any given number of attacking and defending dice?  As an attacker, what ratio has the greatest expected gain?  Anonymous   For those unfamiliar with the game, both the attacker and defender will roll 1 to 8 dice, according to how many armies they each have at that point in a battle.  The higher total shall win.  A tie goes to the defender.  If the attacker loses, he will still retain one army in the territory where he initiated the attack.  For this reason, he must have at least two armies to attack, so if he wins one can inhabit the conquered territory and one can stay behind.

Anonymous   For the benefit of other readers, a Yahtzee is a five of a kind with five dice.  In the game of Yahtzee the player may hold any dice he wishes and re-roll the rest.  He can do this up to three rolls. The player may re-roll previously held dice, if he wishes.  For example, if the player's first roll is 3-3-4-5-6 and he holds the threes and then has 3-3-5-5-5 after the second roll he may keep the fives and re-roll the threes on his third roll. The following table shows the maximum number of dice of the same face for 1 to 20 rolls.  The table shows the probability of getting a Yahtzee within three rolls is about 4.6%.

I am wondering which will come up more rolling a pair of dice — an odd or even total?  relaxmax   The answer is 50/50.  This will be true for any number of dice rolled, not just two. A bit off-topic, but I've always thought an odd/even set of bets would be a good way to replace the dreaded big 6/8 bets in craps.  To give the house an advantage, here are my proposed pay tables and analysis.

This question is raised and discussed in my forum at Wizard of Vegas .    In the Hot Roll bonus, the player wins the following number of coins according to the total of two dice:   2 or 12:	1000 3 or 11:	600 4 or 10:	400 5 or 9:	300 6 or 8:	200 He keeps rolling until he gets a total of seven, which ends the bonus.  If he rolls a seven on the first roll, then he gets a consolation prize of 700 coins.  What is the average coins won per bonus?  Anonymous   The average number of rolls is the inverse of the bonus-ending event, which has a probability of 1/6, so the player will roll six times on average.  However, the last roll will be the seven, so an average of five winning rolls per bonus. Next, here is the probability of each total, assuming no seven:   2 or 12:	1/30 3 or 11:	2/30 4 or 10:	3/30 5 or 9:	4/30 6 or 8:	5/30 So, the average win per roll, assuming no seven, is 2*[(1/30)*1000 + (2/30)*600 + (3/30)*400 + (4/30)*300 + (5/30)*200] = 373.33. The value of the consolation prize is (1/6)*700 = 116.67. Thus, the average bonus win is 116.67 + 5×373.33 = 1983.33.

The casinogenerally pays you less than true odds, which is how they make a profit. But the Free Odds bets are paid at the actual true odds and thereforecarry no house edge — which is why you should put most of your craps money on theFree Odds bets. In this article Bill Burton explains what True Odds are. Understanding Dice Odds Last time I discussed the basics of playing craps. In order to play the game youobviously need dice. You also need an understanding of the dice and the odds andprobabilities of rolling the numbers. In the movies you will see the players picking up the dice and rolling them togetherin both hands before letting them fly down the table as they scream, “Baby needsa new pair of shoes!” or some other wild chant. This is fine in the movies but ina real casino you are only allowed to handle the dice with one hand. Dice are actuallyprecision instruments manufactured to very strict specifications. They are inspectedfor any flaws such as nicks or chips before being put in to play. Rubbing them togetheror other rough handling can damage dice. If the dice are thrown off the table theyhave to be checked before being put back into play. The average life of a pair ofdice is only about eight hours, and then the casino replaces them to ensure thatthe game dice are fresh and fair. Let’s take a look the dice. They’re cubes, about three quarters of an inch square.One alone is called a die. Each die has spots called “pips” totaling a number fromone to six on each side. If you add the corresponding sides you will get the numberseven. The side with six pips will have one pip on the opposite side. Two and fiveare on corresponding sides as are the three and four. Since each die has six sidesand the game is played with two dice, there are 36 (6 x 6) combinations that canbe made giving totals of two through twelve. Take a look at the Dice Chart: You will see that there is only one way to make the numbers two (1 and 1) and twelve(6 and 6). There are two ways to make the number three: (2 and 1) and (1 and 2).If it helps you to understand the combinations, picture a blue and a red die. Youcould have number one on the red and two on the blue, or number two on the red andnumber one on the blue. There are two ways to make the three and eleven. There are three ways to make the four and ten. There are four ways to make the five and nine. There are five ways to make the six and eight. There are six ways to make the seven. By knowing how the numbers are made, you can calculate the odds of making any numberbefore the seven is rolled. Since the number 7 can be rolled six ways, you dividethe number six by the number of ways a number is rolled.   Number  # ways to roll  True Odds    4  3  2 to 1    5  4  3 to 2    6 or 8  5  6 to 5    9  4  3 to 2    10  3  2 to 1   Once you understand the odds and probabilities of the dice, you are on your wayto mastering the game of craps.

A standard die has six sides with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If the die is fair (and we will assume that all of them are), then each of these outcomes are equally likely. Since there are six possible outcomes, the probability of obtaining any side of the die is 1/6. Thus the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6 and so on for 3, 4, 5 and 6.         But what happens if we add another die? What are the probabilities for rolling two dice? What Not to Do To correctly determine the probability of an event we need to know two things.  First, how often the event occurs.  Then second divide the number of outcomes in the event by the total number of outcomes in the sample space . Where most go wrong is to miscalculate the sample space. Their reasoning runs something like this: “We know that each die has six sides. We have rolled two dice , and so the total number of possible outcomes must be 6 + 6 = 12.” Although this explanation was straightforward, it is unfortunately incorrect. It’s plausible that going from one die to two should cause us to add six to itself and get 12, but this comes from not thinking carefully about the problem. A Second Attempt Rolling two fair dice more than doubles the difficulty of calculating probabilities. This is because rolling one die is independent of rolling a second one.   One roll has no effect on the other one. When dealing with independent events we use the multiplication rule . The use of a tree diagram demonstrates that there are really 6 x 6 =36 outcomes from rolling two dice. To think about this, suppose that the first die we roll comes up as a 1. The other die could be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.         Now suppose that the first die is a 2. The other die again could be either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. We have already found 12 potential outcomes, and have yet to exhaust all of the possibilities of the first die. A table of all 36 of the outcomes are in the table below. Sample Problems With this knowledge we can calculate all sorts of two dice probability problems. A few follow: Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is seven? Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is three? Two fair six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the numbers on the dice are different? Three (Or More) Dice The same principle applies if we are working on problems involving three dice . We multiply and see that there are 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 outcomes. As it gets cumbersome to write the repeated multiplication, we can use exponents to simplify our work. For two dice there are 6 2 outcomes. For three dice there are 6 3 outcomes. In general, if we roll n dice, then there are a total of 6 n outcomes.
