You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Twins          Back to Twins           English   Español       My son is going to have twins. I'm a fraternal twin and I have another brother and sister that are fraternal twins. My husband has on his side of the family twins (fraternal) and triplets - boys. Is our son having twins because of our background? Does it have to do with our genetics?        -A curious adult   June 25, 2014  That is a very interesting question! And one that many people wonder about. In fact, we answered a very similar question many years ago.  Twin genetics depend on what kind of twins we are talking about. Having identical twins is not genetic. On the other hand, fraternal twins can run in families.  Genetics can definitely play a role in having fraternal twins. For example, a woman that has a sibling that is a fraternal twin is 2.5 times more likely to have twins than average!  However, for a given pregnancy, only the mother’s genetics matter. Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are simultaneously fertilized instead of just one. A father’s genes can’t make a woman release two eggs.  It sounds like fraternal twins do indeed run in your family! But, since your son is the father, his genes are on the wrong side of the family tree. So, your family history likely didn’t play a role in his wife’s twin pregnancy.  The answer would be different if you were asking about a daughter. Also, although your son’s family history of twins can’t increase his wife’s chance of having twins, he can pass those genes down to your granddaughter. With your strong family history of fraternal twins, this just might increase the chances of your granddaughter having twins!  But, your daughter-in-law is not necessarily having twins because of her genetics. Other things like environment, nutrition, age, and weight have also been linked to having twins as well.  And there is always simple chance…every woman has a chance at having fraternal twins.  It is just that some women have a higher or lower chance.   Huh? Help Me Understand the Genetics!  Wait a minute. One type of twins has a genetic basis and the other does not? And, only the mom’s genetics matter? How is that possible?  Don’t worry. It makes a lot of sense once we break down the biology.  The important difference between identical and fraternal twins is the number of fertilized eggs involved. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg. Fraternal twins come from two different ones.  Identical twins happen when a single embryo splits in two soon after fertilization. This is why identical twins have identical DNA. They came from the same fertilized egg.  Since embryo splitting is a random event that happens by chance, it doesn’t run in families. Genes are not involved. The same is not true for fraternal twins.  Fraternal twins happen when two independent eggs are each fertilized by different sperm.  This is why the DNA of fraternal twins is different. In fact, fhe DNA of fraternal twins is no more similar than the DNA any other sibling pair.  Usually, a woman only releases a single egg at a time. Fraternal twins can only happen if a mother releases two eggs in one cycle. This is called hyperovulation.  Unlike embryo splitting, ovulation is a normal biological process that is controlled by our genes. And, different women can have different versions of these ovulation genes.  Some women have versions (called alleles) of these genes that make them more likely to hyperovulate. This means there is a higher chance that two eggs could get fertilized at once, leading to fraternal twins.  The gene versions that increase the chance of hyperovulation can be passed down from parent to child. This is why fraternal twins run in families.  However, only women ovulate. So, the mother’s genes control this and the fathers don’t.  This is why having a background of twins in the family matters only if it is on the mother’s side. And why your son’s family genetics did not play a role in his twins.  We went over a lot of this stuff in our previous answer, but your question got me thinking. Our last answer on twins was done so long ago. Has recent research discovered anything new on this fascinating topic? They have indeed… at least if you are a sheep!   Counting Sheep can Teach us about Twins  Scientists often turn to animals when they want to study a biological process. Some of the newest information we have about twin genetics comes from studying sheep.  Sheep were chosen because, like people, they typically give birth to a single lamb. However, they can sometimes have twins and triplets.  Different breeds of sheep naturally have higher or lower twin rates.  These different breeds have different versions (called alleles) of some of their genes. Specific alleles can make certain breeds more likely to have twins.  We can compare the genes between these different breeds to try to find the genes controlling twinning. And, this is just what scientists did.  A thorough search for genes controlling twining in sheep identified several interesting ones. The breeds with higher twin rates had different alleles of these genes!  Three key sheep genes identified were named BMP15, GDF9, and BMPR1B. The specific gene names are not really important. Just know that all of these genes are involved in controlling ovulation. Which makes sense!  Remember, hyperovulation increases the chance of having fraternal twins. The sheep breeds with higher than average twin rates had versions of the genes that increase ovulation.  Sheep are a great tool to help us study twin genetics. The tricky part is connecting these findings to people.  It is harder to study humans. Scientists have tried to find links between the genes identified in sheep and human twin genetics. So far they’ve found that some match up and some don’t. This, in and of itself, is interesting!  Another gene called follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH for short, has also been linked to twins in humans. Like the other three genes identified, this FSH is also involved in promoting ovulation, and mothers of fraternal twins often have high levels of it.  It seems that twin genetics is more complicated in humans than in sheep. More genes are likely involved. But, each new bit of information about the genes involved adds another puzzle piece to the complete genetic picture.  Maybe someday we will know all the genes that cause fraternal twins in people.  But for now, you can just tell your son that his genetics likely didn’t cause his twins. Scientists are still trying to figure out which, if any, genes on his wife’s side could possibly be the culprits!

Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are released in one cycle.  We can learn a lot about twinning by studying breeds of sheep that are more likely to have twins.

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

The Claim: Twins Always Skip a Generation   By ANAHAD O’CONNOR OCT. 2, 2007     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           THE FACTS People with twins in their extended families may wonder whether a crib for two is in their future, too. According to conventional wisdom, twins not only run in families, but they also — for some strange reason — always skip at least one generation. It is a claim that is widely repeated, but only partly true.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    Scientists have known for some time that there is a gene that can predispose women to hyperovulation, or releasing two or more eggs in a single menstrual cycle. When both eggs are fertilized, the resulting siblings are fraternal twins.  Because this gene can be passed on, the tendency to have fraternal twins can in fact run in families. Identical twins, on the other hand, result from one fertilized egg randomly splitting in two, creating two siblings with identical DNA. Because there is no known gene that influences this process, it is considered a mere coincidence when one extended family has multiple sets of identical twins. The notion that twins always skip a generation is also a myth. The illusion may have arisen because men who inherit the gene from their mothers are unaffected by it ( they do not ovulate), but can still pass it on to their daughters, who, in turn, will have an increased likelihood of conceiving twins. THE BOTTOM LINE Twins can run in families, but do not necessarily bypass generations.   scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: Twins always skip a generation.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I am told you will need to eat more but when does that start? There does not seem to be a lot of information on twins and how you deal with health and changes over a single birth! I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Twins          Back to Twins           English   Español       My son is going to have twins. I'm a fraternal twin and I have another brother and sister that are fraternal twins. My husband has on his side of the family twins (fraternal) and triplets - boys. Is our son having twins because of our background? Does it have to do with our genetics?        -A curious adult   June 25, 2014  That is a very interesting question! And one that many people wonder about. In fact, we answered a very similar question many years ago.  Twin genetics depend on what kind of twins we are talking about. Having identical twins is not genetic. On the other hand, fraternal twins can run in families.  Genetics can definitely play a role in having fraternal twins. For example, a woman that has a sibling that is a fraternal twin is 2.5 times more likely to have twins than average!  However, for a given pregnancy, only the mother’s genetics matter. Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are simultaneously fertilized instead of just one. A father’s genes can’t make a woman release two eggs.  It sounds like fraternal twins do indeed run in your family! But, since your son is the father, his genes are on the wrong side of the family tree. So, your family history likely didn’t play a role in his wife’s twin pregnancy.  The answer would be different if you were asking about a daughter. Also, although your son’s family history of twins can’t increase his wife’s chance of having twins, he can pass those genes down to your granddaughter. With your strong family history of fraternal twins, this just might increase the chances of your granddaughter having twins!  But, your daughter-in-law is not necessarily having twins because of her genetics. Other things like environment, nutrition, age, and weight have also been linked to having twins as well.  And there is always simple chance…every woman has a chance at having fraternal twins.  It is just that some women have a higher or lower chance.   Huh? Help Me Understand the Genetics!  Wait a minute. One type of twins has a genetic basis and the other does not? And, only the mom’s genetics matter? How is that possible?  Don’t worry. It makes a lot of sense once we break down the biology.  The important difference between identical and fraternal twins is the number of fertilized eggs involved. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg. Fraternal twins come from two different ones.  Identical twins happen when a single embryo splits in two soon after fertilization. This is why identical twins have identical DNA. They came from the same fertilized egg.  Since embryo splitting is a random event that happens by chance, it doesn’t run in families. Genes are not involved. The same is not true for fraternal twins.  Fraternal twins happen when two independent eggs are each fertilized by different sperm.  This is why the DNA of fraternal twins is different. In fact, fhe DNA of fraternal twins is no more similar than the DNA any other sibling pair.  Usually, a woman only releases a single egg at a time. Fraternal twins can only happen if a mother releases two eggs in one cycle. This is called hyperovulation.  Unlike embryo splitting, ovulation is a normal biological process that is controlled by our genes. And, different women can have different versions of these ovulation genes.  Some women have versions (called alleles) of these genes that make them more likely to hyperovulate. This means there is a higher chance that two eggs could get fertilized at once, leading to fraternal twins.  The gene versions that increase the chance of hyperovulation can be passed down from parent to child. This is why fraternal twins run in families.  However, only women ovulate. So, the mother’s genes control this and the fathers don’t.  This is why having a background of twins in the family matters only if it is on the mother’s side. And why your son’s family genetics did not play a role in his twins.  We went over a lot of this stuff in our previous answer, but your question got me thinking. Our last answer on twins was done so long ago. Has recent research discovered anything new on this fascinating topic? They have indeed… at least if you are a sheep!   Counting Sheep can Teach us about Twins  Scientists often turn to animals when they want to study a biological process. Some of the newest information we have about twin genetics comes from studying sheep.  Sheep were chosen because, like people, they typically give birth to a single lamb. However, they can sometimes have twins and triplets.  Different breeds of sheep naturally have higher or lower twin rates.  These different breeds have different versions (called alleles) of some of their genes. Specific alleles can make certain breeds more likely to have twins.  We can compare the genes between these different breeds to try to find the genes controlling twinning. And, this is just what scientists did.  A thorough search for genes controlling twining in sheep identified several interesting ones. The breeds with higher twin rates had different alleles of these genes!  Three key sheep genes identified were named BMP15, GDF9, and BMPR1B. The specific gene names are not really important. Just know that all of these genes are involved in controlling ovulation. Which makes sense!  Remember, hyperovulation increases the chance of having fraternal twins. The sheep breeds with higher than average twin rates had versions of the genes that increase ovulation.  Sheep are a great tool to help us study twin genetics. The tricky part is connecting these findings to people.  It is harder to study humans. Scientists have tried to find links between the genes identified in sheep and human twin genetics. So far they’ve found that some match up and some don’t. This, in and of itself, is interesting!  Another gene called follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH for short, has also been linked to twins in humans. Like the other three genes identified, this FSH is also involved in promoting ovulation, and mothers of fraternal twins often have high levels of it.  It seems that twin genetics is more complicated in humans than in sheep. More genes are likely involved. But, each new bit of information about the genes involved adds another puzzle piece to the complete genetic picture.  Maybe someday we will know all the genes that cause fraternal twins in people.  But for now, you can just tell your son that his genetics likely didn’t cause his twins. Scientists are still trying to figure out which, if any, genes on his wife’s side could possibly be the culprits!

Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are released in one cycle.  We can learn a lot about twinning by studying breeds of sheep that are more likely to have twins.

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

According to conventional wisdom, twins not only run in families, but they also — for some strange reason — always skip at least one generation. It is a claim that is widely repeated, but only partly true.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    Scientists have known for some time that there is a gene that can predispose women to hyperovulation, or releasing two or more eggs in a single menstrual cycle. When both eggs are fertilized, the resulting siblings are fraternal twins.  Because this gene can be passed on, the tendency to have fraternal twins can in fact run in families. Identical twins, on the other hand, result from one fertilized egg randomly splitting in two, creating two siblings with identical DNA. Because there is no known gene that influences this process, it is considered a mere coincidence when one extended family has multiple sets of identical twins. The notion that twins always skip a generation is also a myth. The illusion may have arisen because men who inherit the gene from their mothers are unaffected by it ( they do not ovulate), but can still pass it on to their daughters, who, in turn, will have an increased likelihood of conceiving twins. THE BOTTOM LINE Twins can run in families, but do not necessarily bypass generations.   scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: Twins always skip a generation.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I am told you will need to eat more but when does that start? There does not seem to be a lot of information on twins and how you deal with health and changes over a single birth! I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .
