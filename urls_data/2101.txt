        Everywoman's Health Centre       Condoms    A male or external condom is a covering that fits over an erect penis, almost like a second skin. A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription. It is about 50% effective overall. Ella, which is slightly more effective at 60% is also available by prescription. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.   What kind of condoms should you use?   All brands of condoms are quality tested in Canada, so will be of high quality. However, sometimes condoms are novelty or joke items. Always look to see if the package says the condom will protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Male/external condoms are available in different sizes. Regular sized condoms will fit most people, but if condoms are breaking or slipping off regularly then you may need larger or smaller sized condoms. Sometimes this problem can be solved with more lubrication (see the section about “using a male/external condom” for more information).  Most condoms are made of latex. Some people have latex allergies or sensitivities, so there are condoms made with different materials that you can try. The most common latex alternative is polyurethane (all female/internal condoms are made from polyurethane and some male/external ones are too). There are also some condoms made from animal skin – however, these only protect against pregnancy and not against STIs.  Male condoms are the most commonly used. However, with female or internal condoms , women can have more control over condom use. They can even sometimes be used without a partner knowing, if negotiating condom use is difficult. They are also less likely to break and transfer heat better which for some people can increase sensation. However, they are slightly less effective, more expensive and can also sometimes make noise during intercourse.   Before using a condom   Get familiar with condoms ahead of time. It is best if the first time you see, touch or use a condom is before rather than during sex. Take a condom out of its package, get used to it, try putting it on yourself or on a vegetable or fruit. The more comfortable you are with condoms, the better chance you will be able to use them successfully.  Condoms are most effective when both partners are familiar with them and how they are used.  Communicate with your partner about birth control and condoms before, during and after sex. It is best to make sure you are on the same page about condom use and the amount of risk you are comfortable with ahead of time. It is also important that both of you know that a condom is being used and if it has broken or slipped off so that you can take extra precautions if needed (see the section on about if a condom breaks or slips off).  Store condoms somewhere cool and dry. Heat and sunlight can damage condoms.  Always check the expiry date before using a condom. If the expiry date has passed do not use the condom.  “Pillow test” the condom – before opening it, fold and squeeze the package together into a U-shape. If air escapes and the package goes flat rather than pillowy when folded, then do not use it as there may be tears in the package.  Open the package down the jagged edge and remove it gently. Using teeth or long nails can tear a condom.  Look at the condom to make sure there is no discolouration or flakiness. If there is, throw it away.  Think about whether you would like to use another form of birth control along with condoms – for more information on this, please see our website at ca  Consider whether you would prefer to use male/external condoms (which this handout focuses on) , or female /internal ones. Female/internal condoms go inside the vagina (or can be used anally as well) rather than on the penis.  If you want more information about the female/internal condom, see our website at ca    Using a male/external condom         Use water-based lubricant (lube) to help condoms feel better and be less likely to break or slip off. Start with a lubricated condom and add more to the outside of the condom as well as a few drops in the tip before it is rolled on.  Do not get oil-based products (ex. hand lotion, Vaseline, and lipstick or lip balm) on a condom or it may break.  Put the condom onto the tip of the penis with the rolled up rim facing outward . If you put the condom on the wrong way, it will not roll down. If this happens, discard it because there might already be fluid on it (preejaculate or precum) that can get someone pregnant or give them an STI.  Pinch the tip so that there is no air inside and room for the ejaculate (semen).  Roll the condom down to the base of the penis.  Spermicides can make condoms more effective at preventing pregnancy. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry date, read the instructions, and follow them closely.  It can be good to check the condom during sex to make sure it is not breaking or slipping off.  This can be done regularly throughout intercourse, when shifting positions and/or if the sensation changes (i.e. you start having more or less feeling, the condom feels pulled tight or so on).           Removing and discarding a male/external condom           Withdraw the penis while it is still hard so there is less chance of fluids leaking and move away from the vagina before taking the condom off.  Hold the condom while slowly pulling it off bit by bit, keeping the semen inside. Do not pull from the tip.  Check the condom to see if it is broken. Observe whether fluids are leaking out or if it has any obvious tears.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.            Using a female/internal condom             Insert the condom before intercourse begins – it can be inserted up to 6 hours before, but most people insert it between 2 to 20 minutes before.  Squeeze the loose inner ring together and insert the closed end of the condom high in the vagina.  The outside ring of the condom then lies against the outer lips of the vagina , providing additional protection against STIs.  Hold the outside ring when the penis is first inserted to ensure it goes inside the condom (not along the side) and to prevent the condom from being pushed into the vagina.  If the condom makes noise during sex try changing positions or adding lubricant inside the condom.              Removing and discarding a female/internal condom             After intercourse is finished and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep fluids inside and pull the condom out gently. Be careful not to spill semen near the vagina when you are removing the condom.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.             If a condom breaks or slips off         Discard condom (see above). Use a new condom if you are going to continue having intercourse.  Emergency Pills: Back up with an emergency pill like Plan B or Ella. Plan B and other progestin emergency pills are available at pharmacies without a prescription and you can buy it in advance to have at home. It is approximately 50% effective overall and can be taken up to 5 days after sex, but the sooner you take it the more likely it is to work. Ella is available by prescription. It is more effective overall (approximately 60%) and does not lose effectiveness as quickly over time. They cost $20-$40.  Copper IUD:  : a Copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency birth control – it is over 99% effective at preventing a pregnancy if inserted any time within 7 days after unprotected sex. If you leave the IUD in, it will continue to provide very effective (over 99%) protection. If you do not like it or want to get pregnant, you can have it taken out any time after your next period.  Reassess: if a condom breaks or slips off, it can be a good time to think about whether you want to do something differently with regards to birth control. Is there something you could do to make condoms work better for you? Do you need a more effective method of contraception or something to use in combination with condoms         Questions about condom use or birth control?

But what if you’re messing up—and you don’t even know it?       by Erin Stevens                  Previous story 10 things she says to her friends about you       Next story How soon is too soon to say I love you?                 Shutterstock          Share    Tweet       Print    +/-    Comments       You’re about six beers deep and finally—after several overpriced dinners and cocktails —you’ve convinced a super hot chick that you’re the all-around awesome guy she initially hoped you'd be. Score! So as you head back to your place and things get heated, there’s no shot you’re killing the mood with a condom ...right?       Bad idea. Terrible idea. In fact, that logic is so flawed we’re going to go ahead and counter it with the ultimate mood killer: In the first year of a baby’s life—between doctor visits, clothing, food, and everything else, a parent can expect to spend more than $10,000. (Yeah. Let that sink in.)         So unless you’re ready to trade beer for baby formula, read this—our expansive guide to making sure you don’t knock her up. Because even if you play it safe most of the time, you’re probably screwing up in ways you didn’t even know were possible. And like your old man always said, it only takes one mistake.          Sexual health   Sex myths she believes    These need to be set straight—STAT.      1. The mistake: You think having sex standing up prevents pregnancy  The potential damage: We couldn’t believe that nearly 1 in 5 of men buy into this, but according to a 2010 study , it's true. Yikes. “The law of gravity is not a contraceptive,” says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., the co-director of The Center for Sexual Health Promotion. That’s a seemingly obvious assessment, right? Use it.  2. The mistake: You blindly grab some lube  The potential damage: Always, always, always check what your lube is made out of—otherwise, that condom might do jack. “Oil-based or petroleum-based lubricants like mineral oil or massage lotion can destroy condoms, making them more likely to break,” says sexologist and sexuality educator Megan Andelloux .  3. The mistake: Your hands are sweaty, so one of you tears the condom package with your teeth  The potential damage: Using items like knives or scissors—even your teeth—to open a wrapper will make it very easy to mistakenly poke a hole in the condom. (In one study , dudes who did so were about three times more likely to encounter breakage.) Think about it—do you really want sharp objects coming anywhere near the super-thin barrier that stands between you and fatherhood?          Relationships   How to live with your girlfriend    13 tips to keep the sex hot, independence intact, and love alive.      4. The mistake: You put the condom on—but don’t leave any space in the tip  The potential damage: If you covered up a faucet with your hand and turned it on full blast, where would the water go? See what we’re sayin’? It’s not rocket science. So leave approximately half an inch at the top of the condom to properly “catch” your sperm, says Herbenick; without this wiggle room, you’re risking breakage.  5. The mistake: You don’t use a condom because she’s on the pill  The potential damage: If you’re in a relationship, you should trust that she’s true to her word. But for a one-night stand? It’s not worth the risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , birth control pills are between 91-99% effective in preventing pregnancy—but the pill plus a condom gives you close-to-perfect protection. Your call.  6. The mistake: You were wasted and couldn’t find a condom...so you didn’t use one  The potential damage: Sure, it’s an understandably awkward situation if you’re about to “get it in” and can’t figure out where the hell you put the condom. But is it more awkward than becoming a daddy if you’re not ready for a kid? Get off your ass and search a little harder, or walk to the store and pick up an extra pack. According to the World Health Organization , with perfect use, condoms prevent pregnancy 98% of the time. That’s pretty damn good.          Relationships   Sex positions that won't get her off    Steer clear of these 4 sex positions that won't get her off.      7. The mistake: You’ve had the same condom hanging out in your wallet forever  The potential damage: Using a condom that hasn’t been properly stored might get you into a situation worse than the sexual slump you just endured. According to Herbenick, extreme heat or cold can damage the latex used in condoms, so the best spot for stashing them is a cool, dark, dry place—like in your nightstand—or a small, hard case (think: one made for business cards). And if you’re really trying to be a douche about the whole thing, there's alwasy this $200 Swarovski crystal condom compact .  8. The mistake: You’re not putting lube inside the condom  The potential damage: Those marathon sex sessions you’ve been having (nice work, bro) are bound to wear down the condom, making it dry and prone to ripping. “Always use lube inside the condom. It prevents breakage and, plus, it actually feels so much better for the condom-wearer,” says Andelloux. Remember: Check the type of lube before you apply, and just use a drop—too much can make the condom slip off.  9. The mistake: You take the condom off before the sex is over  The potential damage: If you're patting yourself on the back for using a condom in the first place...don't. Taking a condom off too early on into sex "can directly compromise the efficacy of condom use," according to a recent study from The Journal of Sexual Health . But you know that, silly! So if you play by the rules and keep that sucker on the entire time, it's 98% certain ( see no. 6 ) you won't have to worry about becoming a daddy. (Just be sure you hold the base of the condom during withdrawal to make sure it doesn't slip off or leak you-know-what.)          Relationships   How much sex is too much?    Can you get too much of a good thing? Doctors weigh in.       10. The mistake: You don’t need condoms—you’re a “pull-out pro”  The potential damage: You might think you have impeccable timing, but even if you do pull out in time, it’s still possible to get her pregnant. How? According to Planned Parenthood , your pre-ejaculate can pick up enough sperm left in your pipes from your last ejaculation to fertilize an egg. Whoa. Now, urinating between ejaculations might help, but as they say, it’s always safer to wrap it before you tap it—and the risk-taking for your non -sexual adventures.

Failure rates - Know the risks  There are many different types of contraceptive available, and though no method is 100% reliable, some are more so than others. Contraceptive effectiveness is measured by calculating the failure rate; the percentage of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of use. Most methods have two different failure rates: there's “perfect” use, for when the contraceptive always is properly applied, and “typical” use, which takes in to account mistakes like forgetting to take a pill or a broken condom.  For example, when used correctly the male condom is 98% effective, but that's not to say there is a 2% chance of becoming pregnant every time you use one. A 2% failure rate actually means that for every 100 woman using the contraceptive method for an entire year, two will experience an unintended pregnancy. The effectiveness of some common methods are listed in the following table.       Method    Effectiveness      Typical use    Perfect use      No contraceptive used    15.0%    15.0%      Combined oral contraceptives AKA “the pill    92.0%    99.7%      Female condoms    79.0%    95.0%      Male condoms    85.0%    98.0%              Two is better than one  Although the statistics show that condoms are less effective than the pill, they are the only form of contraception that can prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To make sure you are protected against both the risk of pregnancy and contracting an STI, you should combine condoms with another type of contraception.  Thanks to the laws of probability, using two contraceptive methods at the same time boosts their effectiveness. Remember, if two events A and B are independent, the probability of both occurring is P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B). If you use both a condom and the pill they work independently, because if one method fails it has no impact on the other. That means the failure rate of the combined condom and pill method is the product of their separate failure rates. For perfect use of the male condom and pill, that's 0.02 x 0.003 = 0.00006, or 0.006%. In other words, the combined method is over 99.99% effective when used perfectly.  The figure for “typical” use of the combined method is also much higher than using either method on its own. With failure rates of 15% for the male condom and 8% for the pill it pays to use them together, since 0.15 x 0.08 = 0.012, or 1.2%. With this rating of 98.8% effectiveness, using the combined method is clearly much safer. No one expects you to get out a calculator before you have sex, but you should always understand the risks involved and choose the right contraceptive methods for you.

A male reader asks about the risk of pregnancy even when using a condom while having sex with his girlfriend  By  Debby Herbenick, PhD, MPH | November 29, 2006  Like Tweet  Email Print  More     More on Birth Control   Subscribe to Birth Control          Question: My girlfriend and I are both virgins. I want to have sex with my girlfriend but she is afraid of getting pregnant. I told her that I will use condoms during sex. My question is, if I am using condoms and if I ejaculate in the condom when my penis is in my girlfriend’s vagina, is there any chance of getting her pregnant? Thanks for your time.  The short answer is: yes. There is a chance of pregnancy.  “Correct and Consistent” vs. “Typical”  With correct and consistent (read: every single time you have sex) condom use, condoms are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. However, their effectiveness drops considerably (to about 84% effective ) when one considers actual, typical use of condoms. One reason for the difference in effectiveness rates is that people who say they are condom users don’t always use condoms; sometimes they forget or choose not to use one.  Incomplete condom use (e.g., when two people start having sex without a condom and then add one mid-intercourse; or when two people remove a condom part way through intercourse) also contributes to a lower effectiveness rate – not because there is anything wrong with the condom, but because people sometimes use condoms incorrectly. [See these two  research studies for more information.]  To learn how to use condoms correctly, visit www.plannedparenthood.com or read the package insert enclosed in boxes of condoms. And if you two both decide together, without any pressure at all (feeling pressured into having sex is associated with a greater likelihood of regretting it later ), that you are interested in and ready to have sex together, you might consider using hormonal contraception (such as the IUD, implant, birth control pill, shot, or ring) in addition to condoms to further reduce your pregnancy risk.  Readiness To Have Sex  The longer answer is this: your sex dilemma may be about more than meets the eye. Often when people say that they do not want to have sex because of fill-in-the-blank (e.g., fear of pregnancy, fear of infection, etc), there may be other reasons that they do not yet want to have sex either at that point in their life, or with a specific partner, or at that time in a relationship.  If your girlfriend does not want to be sexual in this way with you, it may have nothing to do with you. If you feel like you two need to have sex in order to be in the relationship, then that is your issue (not hers) and you need to be able to find another way to deal with it other than to try and convince a hesitant partner to have sex with you.  Fear of pregnancy may be a very real reason why your girlfriend does not want to have sex yet. But considering that there are a range of highly effective birth control options available (including birth control pills, patches, rings, and shots, as well as correct and consistent condom use), technically the two of you could work together to figure out a safe, reliable and effective means of contraception.  It may be that there are other reasons that she does not yet want to have intercourse, and it is worth exploring how you feel about each other, your expectations for commitment and exclusivity, and your feelings about the relationship and what you mean to each other.  Don’t Pressure Her  It is important not to pressure your girlfriend into having sex with you if she is not yet ready to. Sex can be fantastic, pleasurable and relationship-building when it is shared with a partner who not only agrees to have sex with you, but who very much wants and desires to have sex with you.  On the other hand, sex can feel empty, meaningless or even scary (emotionally scary and, in terms of pregnancy or infection risk, physically scary) when one or both partners is uncertain about having sex.  As you probably realize, many women and men get mixed messages about sexuality in our culture. Some family, cultural and religious messages suggest that sex is dirty or sinful or only open to certain people (e.g., married adults interested in procreation) whereas others construct sexuality as being intimate, beautiful and open to any adults (regardless of sexual orientation, interest in having children or marital status).  Women often get a sense from popular culture that they should dress and act sexy and available, yet at the same time they may run the risk of being labeled sluts or whores if they act in sexual ways of which others (like their parents, friends or fellow students) disapprove.  Men are often encouraged to go out and have sex with anyone who will have sex with them, even at the expense of their own values or feelings about relationships or how to treat partners.  Given the range of messages that we get from different sources, it is no wonder that sexual decision making can be challenging for individuals and couples. Therefore, we would encourage you to take time with each other, and to be careful with each other’s feelings, when making this big decision.

" Zocdoc › Answers › Can you still get pregnant if you use a condom when having sex? Question I'm 18 and just started having sex with my boyfriend. We use a condom but I do not take the birth control pill. Is there still a chance I can get pregnant? My bf says theres no way if we use condoms. Answer A condom is a barrier contraceptive device used to prevent pregnancy and reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections. They are highly recommended for their indication and work relatively well, however like most things, nothing is perfect 100 % of the time. Condoms, when used exactly as directed have a 1-2% risk of failing per year. Most of this comes from condom breakage or slippage after or during sex. 

In addition, if condoms are used improperly, the failure rate goes up to 10-14% of failure per year. 

That being said, condoms are very effective in birth control and reduction of sexually transmitted infections. Many times, causes for failure can be readily detected. For example, you and/or your partner will notice if a condom breaks or slips off. If that is the case, then an emergency contraception pill (also known as the "morning after pill," or "plan B pill") can be used within 48 hours of intercourse to try to minimize the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Such emergency contraceptive pills can be obtained from a local pharmacy and do NOT require a prescription if the patient is 18 years old. Patients 16 and under require a prescription. 

Please consult your primary care physician/pediatrician/sex counselor for further details or questions regarding condoms, emergency contraception, as well as other forms of contraception such as the birth control pill, Intrauterine devices, etc. Need more info?

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Condoms  Contraception and Birth Control  Pregnancy  Sex Is it possible to become pregnant using condoms? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 20 Answers Quora User , Certified Chilean Midwife. Answered Apr 25, 2017 · Upvoted by Quora User , Been pregnant several times. · Author has 758 answers and 5.6m answer views Originally Answered: Is it possible to be pregnant even after using a condom? I’ll assume you’re referring to “Male condoms” used as the only contraceptive method, instead of “Male” or “Female” condoms used in combination with hormonal methods of birth control. So, let’s use this practical questionnaire to find out: Was the condom stored properly after purchase? Was the condom’s expiration date checked before its use? Was the condom wrapper checked to determine indemnity before its use? Was the condom wrapper opened carefully and without the use of sharp objects (like nails, teeth, scissors, etc)? Was the condom placed properly? Did the size of the condom fit its user properly? Was the condom placed successfully at the first try? Was the condom placed before any direct genital-to-genital contact? Did the condom stay in place during penetration? Was the condom retired after ejaculation? Was the condom retired at a safe distance from the partner’s genitals? Was the condom visually inspected for notorious signs of damage? Did direct genital-to-genital contact cease completely after the condom was retired? Was the condom used a single time? Were condoms or other forms of contraception used properly and consistently during subsequent sexual encounters between at least two partners that are biologically capable of reproduction? If your answer was “No” or “I don’t know” to any of the questions above, and no precautionary measures were taken afterwards to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, then yes, pregnancy is a possibility. If the answer was “Yes” to all questions, then pregnancy is unlikely, but still possible.

Answered Mar 7, 2016 · Author has 543 answers and 2.8m answer views Originally Answered: Can you get pregnant when you're using condoms? Pregnancy can occur whenever you have sex. Condoms are between 86%-98% effective in preventing unintended pregnancy depending on use - obviously if used correctly condoms alone are an effective form of birth control, but there's still always pregnancy risk regardless of how careful you are. Condom Basics: A User's Manual  Your Map to the Condom Aisle  Unless you use Symptothermal Fertility Awareness Method you can't know for sure when you're fertile or ovulating, thus always assume pregnancy is possible and use birth control. If you suspect birth control has failed seek emergency contraception. Plan B can be used up to 72 hours after sex. Yuzpe can be used up to 72 hours after sex. EllaOne can be used up to 120 hours after sex. IUD can be used up to 120 hours after sex. The sooner emergency contraception is used the lower the risk of pregnancy. Emergency Contraception  Your vagina and vulva would be covered in discharge and lubrication following sex, that's normal - also for the record white discharge isn't a sign of ovulation, leading up to and during ovulation you'd see fertile cervical mucus which is typically clear and stretchy. As long as the condom didn't have a hole in it (which can be checked by filling with water) then there's no reason to think this fluid on you was his semen. Don't discount his concerns - his life is involved here too so you need to sit down and discuss birth control with him, if he doesn't feel secure using condoms alone then discuss whether you'd be willing to use other birth control methods instead or as back-up to condoms. You both need to discuss how you'd access emergency contraception if there are concerns about your primary birth control method failing, also what you would both be likely to do if you were to fall pregnant as a result of sex. It's important he understands basic female anatomy, he should be aware that in females discharge and lubrication from the vagina is perfectly normal - if he's really unaware of this I suggest asking him to educate himself prior to continuing sex. 11.2k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Vannette , sex positive and curious Answered Mar 21, 2017 · Author has 8.6k answers and 34.3m answer views Condoms are not 100% effective, so yes, it is possible to get pregnant when using a condom. Condoms work by stopping semen from entering the vagina. If something happens to allow semen into the vagina — the condom tears, slips, falls off, etc. — then all bets are off. This is why it's important to learn how to use condoms correctly: Get the right size Put it on right Use adequate lubrication Keep an eye on it during sex Withdraw immediately after ejaculation Hold the base when withdrawing If you use a condom every time you have sex, and you use it correctly, they are 98% effective.

Male condoms have roughly a 3% failure rate in a year. 3% is low, but other contraception is better. I have an IUD, which gives approximately a .3% failure rate, or even lower with recent advancements. They also last for years with no maintenance or attention required. Easy! Other highly-effective options are implants and birth control pills. Even better, double one of these up with condoms. Combined birth control provides nearly 100% effective control against pregnancy.

When properly used, a condom is 98% safe. However, many people don’t use it correctly or even reuse condoms over and over again making the effectiveness of a condom as low as 80%. One common mistake is that someone left no space for the semen inside the condom. So, when you ejaculate, the sperm can’t collect in this spare room and thus gets squished around the side of the penis or is just kept inside. Both would make it more likely that the semen can still escape and if it somehow manages to get inside the vagina, then you might become a daddy. ;-) Still, a woman only has about 25% chance of getting pregnant per month. Multiply this with the 80% of handling the condom badly and the chance that you filled her up is still very low.

Condoms, when used correctly, are 98 percent effective. That's pretty good. Unfortunately, people don't use them perfectly every single time. In practice, they're about 86 percent effective at preventing pregnancy and STDs. Birth control pills, by comparison, are 0 percent effective against STDs and 99.9 percent effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly. They're not used correctly by every person either. Bottom line, your best shot at preventing pregnancy while still having a healthy sex life is to double up on your contraceptive use. She should use some form of birth control and you should use a condom. It's always better to have a back up plan. 199 Views · View Upvoters Quora User , sex health educator, reproductive rights advocate Answered Mar 25, 2018 · Author has 171 answers and 112.5k answer views Originally Answered: Is it possible to get pregnant after using protection as only condom? I’m guessing you mean using condom as your only protection, in which case, yes. It’s unlikely, as condoms have an over 99% success rate in preventing pregnancy (when used correctly!!) but it’s still technically possible. And there are many ways in which one could misuse the condom. Here is the proper usage procedure for a condom. It may seem obvious but there are a lot of frequently skipped details. Check expiration date on wrapper. Feel for a slight air bubble in the wrapper to make sure the seal is still good. Push the condom to one side of the wrapper, then on the other, tear open the wrapper USING YOUR FINGERS, NEVER YOUR TEETH (or you could risk tearing the condom itself). Pinch the tip of the rolled up condom. Keeping the tip pinched, pull it down the erect penis. If you have difficulty doing this, it’s probably because you put it on the wrong way. GET A NEW CONDOM! Don’t use this one; it’s no good anymore. Do your thing, making sure to switch condoms every time you go to a new orifice (or partner) to prevent infection. After ejaculation, hold the base of the still erect penis and pull out carefully. Carefully slide the condom off, making sure not to spill anything. If anything gets near the vagina, you could be at risk for pregnancy or an STI. Toss out the condom, and you’re done! Some people insist on tying it up first to prevent a mess in the trash can, but that’s up to you. I know this may sound overly rigorous, but with practice this procedure will feel like a natural part of foreplay. 49 Views Quora User , Sexually active for 11 years Answered Dec 14, 2017 · Author has 2.7k answers and 1.8m answer views Originally Answered: Is it possible to be pregnant when using condom?

Answered Dec 14, 2017 · Author has 3.5k answers and 2.3m answer views Originally Answered: Is it possible to be pregnant when using condom? There isn’t a single birth control method that totally prevents pregnancies, 100% valid. A woman who does not use any birth control method has a 50–80% risk of getting pregnant within the year (depending mostly on age). Condoms, if used properly, bring down this risk to the 2%, which is quite a lot less. Unfortunately, many people use the condom badly: they don’t use new condoms, reuse the same condom two or more times, use condoms with oil-based lubricants, do not hold the condom while extracting the penis immediately after the orgasm, use the wrong sized condom, extract the penis before orgasm, do not use the condom always, only on days they perceive as risky, etc. All of these behaviors accentuate the risk of the condom breaking or leaking. A break is usually very quickly noticeable and (unlike with other methods) it’s easy to go grab an emergency pill if you really feel in danger of getting pregnant (danger as you are not wanting the pregnancy, not because pregnancy is a bad thing). But yes, a modest risk of getting pregnant is always present with any birth control methods. 252 Views   Diana Lucas , Business Owner (1998-present) Answered Aug 29, 2017 · Author has 626 answers and 1.8m answer views Originally Answered: Can I get pregnant even after we used a condom? Condoms, when used correctly, are 98% effective in preventing pregnancy (and STDs.) Pregnancy can occur if the condom is not put on properly, put on too late during sex, has a defect or is not the correct size. Sometimes, a condom may break during sex, which is the same as not using a condom at all. Since condoms are not 100% effective, there is always a slight chance of pregnancy, however, in most cases they are effective. The only 100% effective way not to get pregnant is not to have sex, but that is hardly practical for most people. 757 Views   Amy Oakes , Dressmaker, Fashion Designer and Artist.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Sex and Pregnancy  Getting Pregnant  Pregnancy  Sex Can I get pregnant after having sex twice in one day (second time without a condom) even if he wiped his penis completely and entered me dry? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 8 Answers   Gabriela Gomez , studied at University of Arkansas Updated Apr 5, 2016 I would take the day after pill because I am paranoid. I am not a gynecologist, but I was young and stupid and had unprotected sex and then got worried. I never got pregnant, but that is no the point. Supposing that he washed himself and peed at least one time before the second time and that he truly pulled out on time, you wouldn't get pregnant since any sperm left is too (weak?). I don't remember the word, but there was a study that concluded they the remaining sperm in the conducts  was not enough to get pregnant in most cases. If he did not peed before the second time you can get pregnant since some sperm stays in the penis conduct and is later released either when he pees or in seminal liquid when he has sex again. Also do not always believe him when he says he pulled out on time, specially if he has little experience. In those cases men tend to say anything just to male you not worry or to have sex again with you in the future. Just buy condoms and avoid the fear. I got a suggestion for my answer: "I guess I could be wrong but I have always heard that for you Dracula or pre-come is higher in potency if you're not familiar with what this is this is small amounts of sperm, that are released during sex while not having an orgasm cause many many pregnancies due to fact of pulling out was 100% or even 90s it wouldn't be such a sketchy thing but speaking from care pregnancy it's not enough specially if you're a teenager you should do more to prevent getting pregnant it's just especially harder when you're a teenager to do this but I was a teenager wants to I know but the fact that you had sex earlier may not really matter depending on the guy was me five times it would not hire six" Since I am not an expert, I cannot give you a sound conclusion. However, I do recommend reading this page: Can Pregnancy Occur | Pregnancy Myths on How Pregnancy Occurs  That page answers questions that you may have like the following: Can pregnancy occur if penetration only happens for a few seconds? Anytime the penis comes into direct contact with the vaginal area, there is the chance of pregnancy. The probability is extremely low, particularly compared to if intercourse with ejaculation took place, but there is still a risk. The transmission of STIs can also happen through any type of skin to skin contact like this. Can pregnancy occur if a woman and a guy have faux sex or dry sex? This is when there is no penetration, but there is skin to skin contact of the genital area. Again, anytime the penis and the vaginal area come into contact, there is the slight risk of pregnancy and a risk for STD transmission. All that needs to happen is for seminal fluid to leak inside the vagina. Can a woman get pregnant from pre-ejaculation? Pre-ejaculation is the liquid that seeps out of the penis before ejaculation occurs. This fluid is released from the cowpers gland, located at the top of the urethra. The purpose of this fluid is to reduce the acidity in the urethra and provide lubricant for the sperm that is released once ejaculation occurs. Most men have no control over it and cannot feel it coming out. There is much conflicting data on whether this fluid contains sperm that can result in pregnancy. Some studies have concluded it does contain sperm and others have concluded it does not. Most sources do agree that without definitive confirmation, other precautions should still be taken to protect from pregnancy and STI transmission. According to this other page " Can You Get Pregnant With Precum? " you should be safe: "(...) investigation revealed that the majority of pre-ejaculate fluid had dead or no sperm at all. It is possible for small amounts of sperm to exit your reproductive system and make its way into the precum or pre-ejaculate. Can you get pregnant with precum?  Well the expected answer and usual answer is no . There are rare cases where living sperm can be presented in the precum and conception subsequently possible." 92.6k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Pills with a placebo week are designed that way so you don’t lose the habit of taking the pill everyday, it does not mean in any way you’re not protected during this week. On the other hand, as many have said, if you had not been on the pill, then yes you might have been at risk there. Spermatozoides are not only found in sperm but also in seminal liquid which is used as lubricant by the penis long before ejaculation.

Men will generate semen before they orgasm, that will seep out during the course of sex (so-called “pre-cum”), and this is fully capable of impregnating a woman. This is why pulling out doesn’t really work, because the man has already released semen inside of you long before he actually ejaculated. So yes, pregnancy is still possible. The fact you are on birth control obviously helps mitigate this, however. 15.5k Views · View Upvoters   Phil Edwards , Career and Life coach. I've lived and experienced most things.

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers   Prateek Bagri , Selective learner Answered Jan 26, 2015 · Author has 187 answers and 1.2m answer views Originally Answered: Sex: Could my girlfriend be pregnant while practicing pull-out method? Pull out method is the best method to avoid pregnancy but, it comes with a caveat, you have to have a great self control and a lot and I mean a lot of practice to perform it safely. Like Virali said pre-ejaculation is also an issue, hence it comes with its own set of contingencies. I would recommend you to go traditional than being adventurous in this case. Contraceptive pills have side effects too. Like nausea, vomiting, missing periods or haywired periods.  It's likely the pill is reacting with her system. But pills do not claim to be the most accurate solution to unwanted pregnancy. Nonetheless, take a pregnancy test when she's off her period to be sure. No, sperm count does not drop like this. Choice of lifestyle and too much stress affects the sperm count and you cannot tell just by looking at it. Watery and thin is probably due to too much sex/masturbation per day. Testicles need time produce sperm, if you're not giving them enough time it is very likely that you will get that kind of condition, so relax. Practice safe sex. India is already a taboo country where it is okay to have sculptures having sex in the caves but not okay for non-sculptures to have sex. Situations like these puts not only you but your respective families in a jeopardy. It's better to practice safe than to worry about what and whatnot.

According to them it's the only way to safely screw and get to heaven. As a concerned human I have to say that since you have asked this question in the first place that my sarcasm may elude you. The chances of getting pregnant by using the “pull out" method cannot be scientifically quantified simply because there are way too many variables. You have to realize that and should not rely upon it as a method of birth control. The only sure method of birth control is not to have sex, period. The next best method is to keep the female's knees tightly together in order to make sure that no penises enter the vagina. 3k Views · View Upvoters   Ariane Woods , engineer, wife, mother of 2, and very very curious Answered Oct 27, 2015 · Author has 1k answers and 1.9m answer views Originally Answered: If your partner pulls out could you still potentially get pregnant? Yes. According to Guttmacher's Contraceptive Use in the United States (chart is about 60% of the way down the page) , even if used perfectly withdrawl will still result in pregnancy in a year for approximately 2% of couples.  With typical use, pregnancy rates are nearly 1 in 4, which is about where condoms are (in comparison, no attempt at prevention results in pregnancy within a year for a whopping 85% of couples). If you are planning to use withdrawl as a primary line of contraception, I strongly recommend adding in the more involved Fertility Awareness Method (excellent resource here: Taking Charge of Your Fertility, 10th Anniversary Edition) which includes the female partner trcking her cycle via thermometer and cervix position and cervical mucous then practicing periodic abstinance during the very high fertility days (or just being very aware that the male HAS to pull out a few strokes before orgasm those days).  This keeps you from using a barrier and hormones if that is your aim and the combination of methods will drop you back into the single digit percentage odds of pregnancy. (22% failure for withdrawl, 24% failure for FAM, so combined is about 5%). My spouse and I used withdrawl and FAM with occasional condoms to space our second pregnancy out after I decided to go off the pill and were successful until we decided to try for this one. Please note that withdrawl provides only slight protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) so you will still want to have both of you tested. 4.3k Views   John Burgess , Former US Foreign Service Officer who's been around the block (and the world) a few times.

Firstly, you cannot determine sperm count on the appearance of your semen. Secondly, the pull out method is not safe, there's something called pre-ejaculate which also contains sperm, if I'm not mistaken, which can get your girlfriend pregnant. Thirdly, contraceptive pills do not work like birth control pills, they might reduce the chance of pregnancy, but it's not always accurate. Fourthly, even though you didn't mention it, she can get pregnant if you have unprotected sex while she's on her period. You might want to wait a couple days and have her take a pregnancy test to be sure that she isn't pregnant. Also, always practice safe sex, use a condom or ask her to start taking birth control pills. You're asking for trouble, as you're both very young, and it can cause unwanted consequences where you, your girlfriend, and your families will have to suffer if no one is cooperative. 9.5k Views · View Upvoters   Valarie Serviss Answered Oct 1, 2016 Well, from my experience, my fiance and i never got pregnant from that method until the last child was conceived.

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 3 Answers   Liang-Hai Sie , retired general internist, former intensive care physician. Answered Nov 1, 2014 · Author has 24.8k answers and 48.6m answer views It depends on how well the male uses the condom, even if the condom didn't break, if after ejaculating and losing one's erection - so the penis has shrunk and the condom has become too loose on the penis - the male hasn't yet exited the vagina, sperm will leak into the vagina and could impregnate the woman. Some males use a condom after penetrating the woman vaginally without a condom first, the pre-cum which could have come out of the penis does  rarely contain viable sperm too. So optimally one needs to use a condom before entering the woman vaginally, and get out as soon as one has ejaculated before by losing one's erection will make the condom too loose for the shrunken penis and leak sperm into the vagina. In such a "perfect use" the Pearl Index (number of women getting pregnant using this contraceptive per 100 women per year) is 2%, but beware that in typical use (including all the sloppiness humans are prone to) is is 18%!!!!

Ask New Question Sitemap: # A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z About · Careers · Privacy · Terms · Contact        Everywoman's Health Centre       Condoms    A male or external condom is a covering that fits over an erect penis, almost like a second skin. A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription. It is about 50% effective overall. Ella, which is slightly more effective at 60% is also available by prescription. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.   What kind of condoms should you use?   All brands of condoms are quality tested in Canada, so will be of high quality. However, sometimes condoms are novelty or joke items. Always look to see if the package says the condom will protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Male/external condoms are available in different sizes. Regular sized condoms will fit most people, but if condoms are breaking or slipping off regularly then you may need larger or smaller sized condoms. Sometimes this problem can be solved with more lubrication (see the section about “using a male/external condom” for more information).  Most condoms are made of latex. Some people have latex allergies or sensitivities, so there are condoms made with different materials that you can try. The most common latex alternative is polyurethane (all female/internal condoms are made from polyurethane and some male/external ones are too). There are also some condoms made from animal skin – however, these only protect against pregnancy and not against STIs.  Male condoms are the most commonly used. However, with female or internal condoms , women can have more control over condom use. They can even sometimes be used without a partner knowing, if negotiating condom use is difficult. They are also less likely to break and transfer heat better which for some people can increase sensation. However, they are slightly less effective, more expensive and can also sometimes make noise during intercourse.   Before using a condom   Get familiar with condoms ahead of time. It is best if the first time you see, touch or use a condom is before rather than during sex. Take a condom out of its package, get used to it, try putting it on yourself or on a vegetable or fruit. The more comfortable you are with condoms, the better chance you will be able to use them successfully.  Condoms are most effective when both partners are familiar with them and how they are used.  Communicate with your partner about birth control and condoms before, during and after sex. It is best to make sure you are on the same page about condom use and the amount of risk you are comfortable with ahead of time. It is also important that both of you know that a condom is being used and if it has broken or slipped off so that you can take extra precautions if needed (see the section on about if a condom breaks or slips off).  Store condoms somewhere cool and dry. Heat and sunlight can damage condoms.  Always check the expiry date before using a condom. If the expiry date has passed do not use the condom.  “Pillow test” the condom – before opening it, fold and squeeze the package together into a U-shape. If air escapes and the package goes flat rather than pillowy when folded, then do not use it as there may be tears in the package.  Open the package down the jagged edge and remove it gently. Using teeth or long nails can tear a condom.  Look at the condom to make sure there is no discolouration or flakiness. If there is, throw it away.  Think about whether you would like to use another form of birth control along with condoms – for more information on this, please see our website at ca  Consider whether you would prefer to use male/external condoms (which this handout focuses on) , or female /internal ones. Female/internal condoms go inside the vagina (or can be used anally as well) rather than on the penis.  If you want more information about the female/internal condom, see our website at ca    Using a male/external condom         Use water-based lubricant (lube) to help condoms feel better and be less likely to break or slip off. Start with a lubricated condom and add more to the outside of the condom as well as a few drops in the tip before it is rolled on.  Do not get oil-based products (ex. hand lotion, Vaseline, and lipstick or lip balm) on a condom or it may break.  Put the condom onto the tip of the penis with the rolled up rim facing outward . If you put the condom on the wrong way, it will not roll down. If this happens, discard it because there might already be fluid on it (preejaculate or precum) that can get someone pregnant or give them an STI.  Pinch the tip so that there is no air inside and room for the ejaculate (semen).  Roll the condom down to the base of the penis.  Spermicides can make condoms more effective at preventing pregnancy. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry date, read the instructions, and follow them closely.  It can be good to check the condom during sex to make sure it is not breaking or slipping off.  This can be done regularly throughout intercourse, when shifting positions and/or if the sensation changes (i.e. you start having more or less feeling, the condom feels pulled tight or so on).           Removing and discarding a male/external condom           Withdraw the penis while it is still hard so there is less chance of fluids leaking and move away from the vagina before taking the condom off.  Hold the condom while slowly pulling it off bit by bit, keeping the semen inside. Do not pull from the tip.  Check the condom to see if it is broken. Observe whether fluids are leaking out or if it has any obvious tears.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.            Using a female/internal condom             Insert the condom before intercourse begins – it can be inserted up to 6 hours before, but most people insert it between 2 to 20 minutes before.  Squeeze the loose inner ring together and insert the closed end of the condom high in the vagina.  The outside ring of the condom then lies against the outer lips of the vagina , providing additional protection against STIs.  Hold the outside ring when the penis is first inserted to ensure it goes inside the condom (not along the side) and to prevent the condom from being pushed into the vagina.  If the condom makes noise during sex try changing positions or adding lubricant inside the condom.              Removing and discarding a female/internal condom             After intercourse is finished and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep fluids inside and pull the condom out gently. Be careful not to spill semen near the vagina when you are removing the condom.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.             If a condom breaks or slips off         Discard condom (see above). Use a new condom if you are going to continue having intercourse.  Emergency Pills: Back up with an emergency pill like Plan B or Ella. Plan B and other progestin emergency pills are available at pharmacies without a prescription and you can buy it in advance to have at home. It is approximately 50% effective overall and can be taken up to 5 days after sex, but the sooner you take it the more likely it is to work. Ella is available by prescription. It is more effective overall (approximately 60%) and does not lose effectiveness as quickly over time. They cost $20-$40.  Copper IUD:  : a Copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency birth control – it is over 99% effective at preventing a pregnancy if inserted any time within 7 days after unprotected sex. If you leave the IUD in, it will continue to provide very effective (over 99%) protection. If you do not like it or want to get pregnant, you can have it taken out any time after your next period.  Reassess: if a condom breaks or slips off, it can be a good time to think about whether you want to do something differently with regards to birth control. Is there something you could do to make condoms work better for you? Do you need a more effective method of contraception or something to use in combination with condoms         Questions about condom use or birth control?

A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription.

But what if you’re messing up—and you don’t even know it?       by Erin Stevens                  Previous story 10 things she says to her friends about you       Next story How soon is too soon to say I love you?                 Shutterstock          Share    Tweet       Print    +/-    Comments       You’re about six beers deep and finally—after several overpriced dinners and cocktails —you’ve convinced a super hot chick that you’re the all-around awesome guy she initially hoped you'd be. Score! So as you head back to your place and things get heated, there’s no shot you’re killing the mood with a condom ...right?       Bad idea. Terrible idea. In fact, that logic is so flawed we’re going to go ahead and counter it with the ultimate mood killer: In the first year of a baby’s life—between doctor visits, clothing, food, and everything else, a parent can expect to spend more than $10,000. (Yeah. Let that sink in.)         So unless you’re ready to trade beer for baby formula, read this—our expansive guide to making sure you don’t knock her up. Because even if you play it safe most of the time, you’re probably screwing up in ways you didn’t even know were possible. And like your old man always said, it only takes one mistake.          Sexual health   Sex myths she believes    These need to be set straight—STAT.      1. The mistake: You think having sex standing up prevents pregnancy  The potential damage: We couldn’t believe that nearly 1 in 5 of men buy into this, but according to a 2010 study , it's true. Yikes. “The law of gravity is not a contraceptive,” says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., the co-director of The Center for Sexual Health Promotion. That’s a seemingly obvious assessment, right? Use it.  2. The mistake: You blindly grab some lube  The potential damage: Always, always, always check what your lube is made out of—otherwise, that condom might do jack. “Oil-based or petroleum-based lubricants like mineral oil or massage lotion can destroy condoms, making them more likely to break,” says sexologist and sexuality educator Megan Andelloux .  3. The mistake: Your hands are sweaty, so one of you tears the condom package with your teeth  The potential damage: Using items like knives or scissors—even your teeth—to open a wrapper will make it very easy to mistakenly poke a hole in the condom. (In one study , dudes who did so were about three times more likely to encounter breakage.) Think about it—do you really want sharp objects coming anywhere near the super-thin barrier that stands between you and fatherhood?          Relationships   How to live with your girlfriend    13 tips to keep the sex hot, independence intact, and love alive.      4. The mistake: You put the condom on—but don’t leave any space in the tip  The potential damage: If you covered up a faucet with your hand and turned it on full blast, where would the water go? See what we’re sayin’? It’s not rocket science. So leave approximately half an inch at the top of the condom to properly “catch” your sperm, says Herbenick; without this wiggle room, you’re risking breakage.  5. The mistake: You don’t use a condom because she’s on the pill  The potential damage: If you’re in a relationship, you should trust that she’s true to her word. But for a one-night stand? It’s not worth the risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , birth control pills are between 91-99% effective in preventing pregnancy—but the pill plus a condom gives you close-to-perfect protection. Your call.  6. The mistake: You were wasted and couldn’t find a condom...so you didn’t use one  The potential damage: Sure, it’s an understandably awkward situation if you’re about to “get it in” and can’t figure out where the hell you put the condom. But is it more awkward than becoming a daddy if you’re not ready for a kid? Get off your ass and search a little harder, or walk to the store and pick up an extra pack. According to the World Health Organization , with perfect use, condoms prevent pregnancy 98% of the time. That’s pretty damn good.          Relationships   Sex positions that won't get her off    Steer clear of these 4 sex positions that won't get her off.      7. The mistake: You’ve had the same condom hanging out in your wallet forever  The potential damage: Using a condom that hasn’t been properly stored might get you into a situation worse than the sexual slump you just endured. According to Herbenick, extreme heat or cold can damage the latex used in condoms, so the best spot for stashing them is a cool, dark, dry place—like in your nightstand—or a small, hard case (think: one made for business cards). And if you’re really trying to be a douche about the whole thing, there's alwasy this $200 Swarovski crystal condom compact .  8. The mistake: You’re not putting lube inside the condom  The potential damage: Those marathon sex sessions you’ve been having (nice work, bro) are bound to wear down the condom, making it dry and prone to ripping. “Always use lube inside the condom. It prevents breakage and, plus, it actually feels so much better for the condom-wearer,” says Andelloux. Remember: Check the type of lube before you apply, and just use a drop—too much can make the condom slip off.  9. The mistake: You take the condom off before the sex is over  The potential damage: If you're patting yourself on the back for using a condom in the first place...don't. Taking a condom off too early on into sex "can directly compromise the efficacy of condom use," according to a recent study from The Journal of Sexual Health . But you know that, silly! So if you play by the rules and keep that sucker on the entire time, it's 98% certain ( see no. 6 ) you won't have to worry about becoming a daddy. (Just be sure you hold the base of the condom during withdrawal to make sure it doesn't slip off or leak you-know-what.)          Relationships   How much sex is too much?    Can you get too much of a good thing? Doctors weigh in.       10. The mistake: You don’t need condoms—you’re a “pull-out pro”  The potential damage: You might think you have impeccable timing, but even if you do pull out in time, it’s still possible to get her pregnant. How? According to Planned Parenthood , your pre-ejaculate can pick up enough sperm left in your pipes from your last ejaculation to fertilize an egg. Whoa. Now, urinating between ejaculations might help, but as they say, it’s always safer to wrap it before you tap it—and the risk-taking for your non -sexual adventures.

Failure rates - Know the risks  There are many different types of contraceptive available, and though no method is 100% reliable, some are more so than others. Contraceptive effectiveness is measured by calculating the failure rate; the percentage of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of use. Most methods have two different failure rates: there's “perfect” use, for when the contraceptive always is properly applied, and “typical” use, which takes in to account mistakes like forgetting to take a pill or a broken condom.  For example, when used correctly the male condom is 98% effective, but that's not to say there is a 2% chance of becoming pregnant every time you use one. A 2% failure rate actually means that for every 100 woman using the contraceptive method for an entire year, two will experience an unintended pregnancy. The effectiveness of some common methods are listed in the following table.       Method    Effectiveness      Typical use    Perfect use      No contraceptive used    15.0%    15.0%      Combined oral contraceptives AKA “the pill    92.0%    99.7%      Female condoms    79.0%    95.0%      Male condoms    85.0%    98.0%              Two is better than one  Although the statistics show that condoms are less effective than the pill, they are the only form of contraception that can prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To make sure you are protected against both the risk of pregnancy and contracting an STI, you should combine condoms with another type of contraception.  Thanks to the laws of probability, using two contraceptive methods at the same time boosts their effectiveness. Remember, if two events A and B are independent, the probability of both occurring is P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B). If you use both a condom and the pill they work independently, because if one method fails it has no impact on the other. That means the failure rate of the combined condom and pill method is the product of their separate failure rates. For perfect use of the male condom and pill, that's 0.02 x 0.003 = 0.00006, or 0.006%. In other words, the combined method is over 99.99% effective when used perfectly.  The figure for “typical” use of the combined method is also much higher than using either method on its own. With failure rates of 15% for the male condom and 8% for the pill it pays to use them together, since 0.15 x 0.08 = 0.012, or 1.2%. With this rating of 98.8% effectiveness, using the combined method is clearly much safer. No one expects you to get out a calculator before you have sex, but you should always understand the risks involved and choose the right contraceptive methods for you.

A male reader asks about the risk of pregnancy even when using a condom while having sex with his girlfriend  By  Debby Herbenick, PhD, MPH | November 29, 2006  Like Tweet  Email Print  More     More on Birth Control   Subscribe to Birth Control          Question: My girlfriend and I are both virgins. I want to have sex with my girlfriend but she is afraid of getting pregnant. I told her that I will use condoms during sex. My question is, if I am using condoms and if I ejaculate in the condom when my penis is in my girlfriend’s vagina, is there any chance of getting her pregnant? Thanks for your time.  The short answer is: yes. There is a chance of pregnancy.  “Correct and Consistent” vs. “Typical”  With correct and consistent (read: every single time you have sex) condom use, condoms are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. However, their effectiveness drops considerably (to about 84% effective ) when one considers actual, typical use of condoms. One reason for the difference in effectiveness rates is that people who say they are condom users don’t always use condoms; sometimes they forget or choose not to use one.  Incomplete condom use (e.g., when two people start having sex without a condom and then add one mid-intercourse; or when two people remove a condom part way through intercourse) also contributes to a lower effectiveness rate – not because there is anything wrong with the condom, but because people sometimes use condoms incorrectly. [See these two  research studies for more information.]  To learn how to use condoms correctly, visit www.plannedparenthood.com or read the package insert enclosed in boxes of condoms. And if you two both decide together, without any pressure at all (feeling pressured into having sex is associated with a greater likelihood of regretting it later ), that you are interested in and ready to have sex together, you might consider using hormonal contraception (such as the IUD, implant, birth control pill, shot, or ring) in addition to condoms to further reduce your pregnancy risk.  Readiness To Have Sex  The longer answer is this: your sex dilemma may be about more than meets the eye. Often when people say that they do not want to have sex because of fill-in-the-blank (e.g., fear of pregnancy, fear of infection, etc), there may be other reasons that they do not yet want to have sex either at that point in their life, or with a specific partner, or at that time in a relationship.  If your girlfriend does not want to be sexual in this way with you, it may have nothing to do with you. If you feel like you two need to have sex in order to be in the relationship, then that is your issue (not hers) and you need to be able to find another way to deal with it other than to try and convince a hesitant partner to have sex with you.  Fear of pregnancy may be a very real reason why your girlfriend does not want to have sex yet. But considering that there are a range of highly effective birth control options available (including birth control pills, patches, rings, and shots, as well as correct and consistent condom use), technically the two of you could work together to figure out a safe, reliable and effective means of contraception.  It may be that there are other reasons that she does not yet want to have intercourse, and it is worth exploring how you feel about each other, your expectations for commitment and exclusivity, and your feelings about the relationship and what you mean to each other.  Don’t Pressure Her  It is important not to pressure your girlfriend into having sex with you if she is not yet ready to. Sex can be fantastic, pleasurable and relationship-building when it is shared with a partner who not only agrees to have sex with you, but who very much wants and desires to have sex with you.  On the other hand, sex can feel empty, meaningless or even scary (emotionally scary and, in terms of pregnancy or infection risk, physically scary) when one or both partners is uncertain about having sex.  As you probably realize, many women and men get mixed messages about sexuality in our culture. Some family, cultural and religious messages suggest that sex is dirty or sinful or only open to certain people (e.g., married adults interested in procreation) whereas others construct sexuality as being intimate, beautiful and open to any adults (regardless of sexual orientation, interest in having children or marital status).  Women often get a sense from popular culture that they should dress and act sexy and available, yet at the same time they may run the risk of being labeled sluts or whores if they act in sexual ways of which others (like their parents, friends or fellow students) disapprove.  Men are often encouraged to go out and have sex with anyone who will have sex with them, even at the expense of their own values or feelings about relationships or how to treat partners.  Given the range of messages that we get from different sources, it is no wonder that sexual decision making can be challenging for individuals and couples. Therefore, we would encourage you to take time with each other, and to be careful with each other’s feelings, when making this big decision.

" Zocdoc › Answers › Can you still get pregnant if you use a condom when having sex? Question I'm 18 and just started having sex with my boyfriend. We use a condom but I do not take the birth control pill. Is there still a chance I can get pregnant? My bf says theres no way if we use condoms. Answer A condom is a barrier contraceptive device used to prevent pregnancy and reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections. They are highly recommended for their indication and work relatively well, however like most things, nothing is perfect 100 % of the time. Condoms, when used exactly as directed have a 1-2% risk of failing per year. Most of this comes from condom breakage or slippage after or during sex. 

In addition, if condoms are used improperly, the failure rate goes up to 10-14% of failure per year. 

That being said, condoms are very effective in birth control and reduction of sexually transmitted infections. Many times, causes for failure can be readily detected. For example, you and/or your partner will notice if a condom breaks or slips off. If that is the case, then an emergency contraception pill (also known as the "morning after pill," or "plan B pill") can be used within 48 hours of intercourse to try to minimize the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Such emergency contraceptive pills can be obtained from a local pharmacy and do NOT require a prescription if the patient is 18 years old. Patients 16 and under require a prescription. 

Please consult your primary care physician/pediatrician/sex counselor for further details or questions regarding condoms, emergency contraception, as well as other forms of contraception such as the birth control pill, Intrauterine devices, etc. Need more info?

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Condoms  Contraception and Birth Control  Pregnancy  Sex Is it possible to become pregnant using condoms? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 20 Answers Quora User , Certified Chilean Midwife. Answered Apr 25, 2017 · Upvoted by Quora User , Been pregnant several times. · Author has 758 answers and 5.6m answer views Originally Answered: Is it possible to be pregnant even after using a condom? I’ll assume you’re referring to “Male condoms” used as the only contraceptive method, instead of “Male” or “Female” condoms used in combination with hormonal methods of birth control. So, let’s use this practical questionnaire to find out: Was the condom stored properly after purchase? Was the condom’s expiration date checked before its use? Was the condom wrapper checked to determine indemnity before its use? Was the condom wrapper opened carefully and without the use of sharp objects (like nails, teeth, scissors, etc)? Was the condom placed properly? Did the size of the condom fit its user properly? Was the condom placed successfully at the first try? Was the condom placed before any direct genital-to-genital contact? Did the condom stay in place during penetration? Was the condom retired after ejaculation? Was the condom retired at a safe distance from the partner’s genitals? Was the condom visually inspected for notorious signs of damage? Did direct genital-to-genital contact cease completely after the condom was retired? Was the condom used a single time? Were condoms or other forms of contraception used properly and consistently during subsequent sexual encounters between at least two partners that are biologically capable of reproduction? If your answer was “No” or “I don’t know” to any of the questions above, and no precautionary measures were taken afterwards to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, then yes, pregnancy is a possibility. If the answer was “Yes” to all questions, then pregnancy is unlikely, but still possible.

Answered Mar 7, 2016 · Author has 543 answers and 2.8m answer views Originally Answered: Can you get pregnant when you're using condoms? Pregnancy can occur whenever you have sex. Condoms are between 86%-98% effective in preventing unintended pregnancy depending on use - obviously if used correctly condoms alone are an effective form of birth control, but there's still always pregnancy risk regardless of how careful you are. Condom Basics: A User's Manual  Your Map to the Condom Aisle  Unless you use Symptothermal Fertility Awareness Method you can't know for sure when you're fertile or ovulating, thus always assume pregnancy is possible and use birth control. If you suspect birth control has failed seek emergency contraception. Plan B can be used up to 72 hours after sex. Yuzpe can be used up to 72 hours after sex. EllaOne can be used up to 120 hours after sex. IUD can be used up to 120 hours after sex. The sooner emergency contraception is used the lower the risk of pregnancy. Emergency Contraception  Your vagina and vulva would be covered in discharge and lubrication following sex, that's normal - also for the record white discharge isn't a sign of ovulation, leading up to and during ovulation you'd see fertile cervical mucus which is typically clear and stretchy. As long as the condom didn't have a hole in it (which can be checked by filling with water) then there's no reason to think this fluid on you was his semen. Don't discount his concerns - his life is involved here too so you need to sit down and discuss birth control with him, if he doesn't feel secure using condoms alone then discuss whether you'd be willing to use other birth control methods instead or as back-up to condoms. You both need to discuss how you'd access emergency contraception if there are concerns about your primary birth control method failing, also what you would both be likely to do if you were to fall pregnant as a result of sex. It's important he understands basic female anatomy, he should be aware that in females discharge and lubrication from the vagina is perfectly normal - if he's really unaware of this I suggest asking him to educate himself prior to continuing sex. 11.2k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Vannette , sex positive and curious Answered Mar 21, 2017 · Author has 8.6k answers and 34.3m answer views Condoms are not 100% effective, so yes, it is possible to get pregnant when using a condom. Condoms work by stopping semen from entering the vagina. If something happens to allow semen into the vagina — the condom tears, slips, falls off, etc. — then all bets are off.

Male condoms have roughly a 3% failure rate in a year. 3% is low, but other contraception is better. I have an IUD, which gives approximately a .3% failure rate, or even lower with recent advancements. They also last for years with no maintenance or attention required. Easy! Other highly-effective options are implants and birth control pills. Even better, double one of these up with condoms. Combined birth control provides nearly 100% effective control against pregnancy. You're going to worry no matter what. I know I do and did, when my period cut out from the hormones. But after a certain point, your fears are safely negligible. 2.7k Views · View Upvoters   Gnanasingh Arputhadas , 1.2 Million Answer Views, 3x Most Viewed Writer.

When properly used, a condom is 98% safe. However, many people don’t use it correctly or even reuse condoms over and over again making the effectiveness of a condom as low as 80%. One common mistake is that someone left no space for the semen inside the condom. So, when you ejaculate, the sperm can’t collect in this spare room and thus gets squished around the side of the penis or is just kept inside. Both would make it more likely that the semen can still escape and if it somehow manages to get inside the vagina, then you might become a daddy. ;-) Still, a woman only has about 25% chance of getting pregnant per month. Multiply this with the 80% of handling the condom badly and the chance that you filled her up is still very low.

Condoms, when used correctly, are 98 percent effective. That's pretty good. Unfortunately, people don't use them perfectly every single time. In practice, they're about 86 percent effective at preventing pregnancy and STDs. Birth control pills, by comparison, are 0 percent effective against STDs and 99.9 percent effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly. They're not used correctly by every person either. Bottom line, your best shot at preventing pregnancy while still having a healthy sex life is to double up on your contraceptive use. She should use some form of birth control and you should use a condom. It's always better to have a back up plan. 199 Views · View Upvoters Quora User , sex health educator, reproductive rights advocate Answered Mar 25, 2018 · Author has 171 answers and 112.5k answer views Originally Answered: Is it possible to get pregnant after using protection as only condom? I’m guessing you mean using condom as your only protection, in which case, yes. It’s unlikely, as condoms have an over 99% success rate in preventing pregnancy (when used correctly!!) but it’s still technically possible. And there are many ways in which one could misuse the condom. Here is the proper usage procedure for a condom. It may seem obvious but there are a lot of frequently skipped details. Check expiration date on wrapper. Feel for a slight air bubble in the wrapper to make sure the seal is still good. Push the condom to one side of the wrapper, then on the other, tear open the wrapper USING YOUR FINGERS, NEVER YOUR TEETH (or you could risk tearing the condom itself). Pinch the tip of the rolled up condom. Keeping the tip pinched, pull it down the erect penis. If you have difficulty doing this, it’s probably because you put it on the wrong way. GET A NEW CONDOM! Don’t use this one; it’s no good anymore. Do your thing, making sure to switch condoms every time you go to a new orifice (or partner) to prevent infection. After ejaculation, hold the base of the still erect penis and pull out carefully. Carefully slide the condom off, making sure not to spill anything. If anything gets near the vagina, you could be at risk for pregnancy or an STI. Toss out the condom, and you’re done! Some people insist on tying it up first to prevent a mess in the trash can, but that’s up to you. I know this may sound overly rigorous, but with practice this procedure will feel like a natural part of foreplay. 49 Views Quora User , Sexually active for 11 years Answered Dec 14, 2017 · Author has 2.7k answers and 1.8m answer views Originally Answered: Is it possible to be pregnant when using condom?

Answered Dec 14, 2017 · Author has 3.5k answers and 2.3m answer views Originally Answered: Is it possible to be pregnant when using condom? There isn’t a single birth control method that totally prevents pregnancies, 100% valid. A woman who does not use any birth control method has a 50–80% risk of getting pregnant within the year (depending mostly on age). Condoms, if used properly, bring down this risk to the 2%, which is quite a lot less. Unfortunately, many people use the condom badly: they don’t use new condoms, reuse the same condom two or more times, use condoms with oil-based lubricants, do not hold the condom while extracting the penis immediately after the orgasm, use the wrong sized condom, extract the penis before orgasm, do not use the condom always, only on days they perceive as risky, etc. All of these behaviors accentuate the risk of the condom breaking or leaking. A break is usually very quickly noticeable and (unlike with other methods) it’s easy to go grab an emergency pill if you really feel in danger of getting pregnant (danger as you are not wanting the pregnancy, not because pregnancy is a bad thing). But yes, a modest risk of getting pregnant is always present with any birth control methods. 252 Views   Diana Lucas , Business Owner (1998-present) Answered Aug 29, 2017 · Author has 626 answers and 1.8m answer views Originally Answered: Can I get pregnant even after we used a condom? Condoms, when used correctly, are 98% effective in preventing pregnancy (and STDs.) Pregnancy can occur if the condom is not put on properly, put on too late during sex, has a defect or is not the correct size. Sometimes, a condom may break during sex, which is the same as not using a condom at all. Since condoms are not 100% effective, there is always a slight chance of pregnancy, however, in most cases they are effective. The only 100% effective way not to get pregnant is not to have sex, but that is hardly practical for most people. 757 Views   Amy Oakes , Dressmaker, Fashion Designer and Artist.

Pills with a placebo week are designed that way so you don’t lose the habit of taking the pill everyday, it does not mean in any way you’re not protected during this week. On the other hand, as many have said, if you had not been on the pill, then yes you might have been at risk there. Spermatozoides are not only found in sperm but also in seminal liquid which is used as lubricant by the penis long before ejaculation.

Ask New Question   Gabriela Gomez , studied at University of Arkansas Updated Apr 5, 2016 I would take the day after pill because I am paranoid. I am not a gynecologist, but I was young and stupid and had unprotected sex and then got worried. I never got pregnant, but that is no the point. Supposing that he washed himself and peed at least one time before the second time and that he truly pulled out on time, you wouldn't get pregnant since any sperm left is too (weak?). I don't remember the word, but there was a study that concluded they the remaining sperm in the conducts  was not enough to get pregnant in most cases. If he did not peed before the second time you can get pregnant since some sperm stays in the penis conduct and is later released either when he pees or in seminal liquid when he has sex again. Also do not always believe him when he says he pulled out on time, specially if he has little experience. In those cases men tend to say anything just to male you not worry or to have sex again with you in the future. Just buy condoms and avoid the fear. I got a suggestion for my answer: "I guess I could be wrong but I have always heard that for you Dracula or pre-come is higher in potency if you're not familiar with what this is this is small amounts of sperm, that are released during sex while not having an orgasm cause many many pregnancies due to fact of pulling out was 100% or even 90s it wouldn't be such a sketchy thing but speaking from care pregnancy it's not enough specially if you're a teenager you should do more to prevent getting pregnant it's just especially harder when you're a teenager to do this but I was a teenager wants to I know but the fact that you had sex earlier may not really matter depending on the guy was me five times it would not hire six" Since I am not an expert, I cannot give you a sound conclusion. However, I do recommend reading this page: Can Pregnancy Occur | Pregnancy Myths on How Pregnancy Occurs  That page answers questions that you may have like the following: Can pregnancy occur if penetration only happens for a few seconds? Anytime the penis comes into direct contact with the vaginal area, there is the chance of pregnancy. The probability is extremely low, particularly compared to if intercourse with ejaculation took place, but there is still a risk. The transmission of STIs can also happen through any type of skin to skin contact like this. Can pregnancy occur if a woman and a guy have faux sex or dry sex? This is when there is no penetration, but there is skin to skin contact of the genital area. Again, anytime the penis and the vaginal area come into contact, there is the slight risk of pregnancy and a risk for STD transmission. All that needs to happen is for seminal fluid to leak inside the vagina. Can a woman get pregnant from pre-ejaculation? Pre-ejaculation is the liquid that seeps out of the penis before ejaculation occurs. This fluid is released from the cowpers gland, located at the top of the urethra. The purpose of this fluid is to reduce the acidity in the urethra and provide lubricant for the sperm that is released once ejaculation occurs. Most men have no control over it and cannot feel it coming out. There is much conflicting data on whether this fluid contains sperm that can result in pregnancy. Some studies have concluded it does contain sperm and others have concluded it does not. Most sources do agree that without definitive confirmation, other precautions should still be taken to protect from pregnancy and STI transmission. According to this other page " Can You Get Pregnant With Precum? " you should be safe: "(...) investigation revealed that the majority of pre-ejaculate fluid had dead or no sperm at all. It is possible for small amounts of sperm to exit your reproductive system and make its way into the precum or pre-ejaculate. Can you get pregnant with precum?  Well the expected answer and usual answer is no . There are rare cases where living sperm can be presented in the precum and conception subsequently possible." 92.6k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Men will generate semen before they orgasm, that will seep out during the course of sex (so-called “pre-cum”), and this is fully capable of impregnating a woman. This is why pulling out doesn’t really work, because the man has already released semen inside of you long before he actually ejaculated. So yes, pregnancy is still possible.

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers   Prateek Bagri , Selective learner Answered Jan 26, 2015 · Author has 187 answers and 1.2m answer views Originally Answered: Sex: Could my girlfriend be pregnant while practicing pull-out method? Pull out method is the best method to avoid pregnancy but, it comes with a caveat, you have to have a great self control and a lot and I mean a lot of practice to perform it safely. Like Virali said pre-ejaculation is also an issue, hence it comes with its own set of contingencies. I would recommend you to go traditional than being adventurous in this case. Contraceptive pills have side effects too. Like nausea, vomiting, missing periods or haywired periods.  It's likely the pill is reacting with her system. But pills do not claim to be the most accurate solution to unwanted pregnancy. Nonetheless, take a pregnancy test when she's off her period to be sure. No, sperm count does not drop like this. Choice of lifestyle and too much stress affects the sperm count and you cannot tell just by looking at it. Watery and thin is probably due to too much sex/masturbation per day. Testicles need time produce sperm, if you're not giving them enough time it is very likely that you will get that kind of condition, so relax. Practice safe sex. India is already a taboo country where it is okay to have sculptures having sex in the caves but not okay for non-sculptures to have sex. Situations like these puts not only you but your respective families in a jeopardy. It's better to practice safe than to worry about what and whatnot.

Updated Apr 5, 2017 Ahh, the favored method of birth control advocated by none other than the Catholic Church, an institution whose future relies upon an unending stream of new participants. According to them it's the only way to safely screw and get to heaven. As a concerned human I have to say that since you have asked this question in the first place that my sarcasm may elude you. The chances of getting pregnant by using the “pull out" method cannot be scientifically quantified simply because there are way too many variables. You have to realize that and should not rely upon it as a method of birth control. The only sure method of birth control is not to have sex, period. The next best method is to keep the female's knees tightly together in order to make sure that no penises enter the vagina. 3k Views · View Upvoters   Ariane Woods , engineer, wife, mother of 2, and very very curious Answered Oct 27, 2015 · Author has 1k answers and 1.9m answer views Originally Answered: If your partner pulls out could you still potentially get pregnant? Yes. According to Guttmacher's Contraceptive Use in the United States (chart is about 60% of the way down the page) , even if used perfectly withdrawl will still result in pregnancy in a year for approximately 2% of couples.  With typical use, pregnancy rates are nearly 1 in 4, which is about where condoms are (in comparison, no attempt at prevention results in pregnancy within a year for a whopping 85% of couples). If you are planning to use withdrawl as a primary line of contraception, I strongly recommend adding in the more involved Fertility Awareness Method (excellent resource here: Taking Charge of Your Fertility, 10th Anniversary Edition) which includes the female partner trcking her cycle via thermometer and cervix position and cervical mucous then practicing periodic abstinance during the very high fertility days (or just being very aware that the male HAS to pull out a few strokes before orgasm those days).  This keeps you from using a barrier and hormones if that is your aim and the combination of methods will drop you back into the single digit percentage odds of pregnancy. (22% failure for withdrawl, 24% failure for FAM, so combined is about 5%). My spouse and I used withdrawl and FAM with occasional condoms to space our second pregnancy out after I decided to go off the pill and were successful until we decided to try for this one. Please note that withdrawl provides only slight protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) so you will still want to have both of you tested. 4.3k Views   John Burgess , Former US Foreign Service Officer who's been around the block (and the world) a few times.

Firstly, you cannot determine sperm count on the appearance of your semen. Secondly, the pull out method is not safe, there's something called pre-ejaculate which also contains sperm, if I'm not mistaken, which can get your girlfriend pregnant. Thirdly, contraceptive pills do not work like birth control pills, they might reduce the chance of pregnancy, but it's not always accurate. Fourthly, even though you didn't mention it, she can get pregnant if you have unprotected sex while she's on her period. You might want to wait a couple days and have her take a pregnancy test to be sure that she isn't pregnant. Also, always practice safe sex, use a condom or ask her to start taking birth control pills. You're asking for trouble, as you're both very young, and it can cause unwanted consequences where you, your girlfriend, and your families will have to suffer if no one is cooperative. 9.5k Views · View Upvoters   Valarie Serviss Answered Oct 1, 2016 Well, from my experience, my fiance and i never got pregnant from that method until the last child was conceived.

Wait let me get through laughing first - pull out is not ever a good plan. Trust me I have 2 children "being careful."  Birth control doesn't work unless they are taken everyday and condoms never work unless you use them and then it is a hit or miss and pray. Have you ever heard of "precum?"

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 3 Answers   Liang-Hai Sie , retired general internist, former intensive care physician. Answered Nov 1, 2014 · Author has 24.8k answers and 48.6m answer views It depends on how well the male uses the condom, even if the condom didn't break, if after ejaculating and losing one's erection - so the penis has shrunk and the condom has become too loose on the penis - the male hasn't yet exited the vagina, sperm will leak into the vagina and could impregnate the woman. Some males use a condom after penetrating the woman vaginally without a condom first, the pre-cum which could have come out of the penis does  rarely contain viable sperm too. So optimally one needs to use a condom before entering the woman vaginally, and get out as soon as one has ejaculated before by losing one's erection will make the condom too loose for the shrunken penis and leak sperm into the vagina. In such a "perfect use" the Pearl Index (number of women getting pregnant using this contraceptive per 100 women per year) is 2%, but beware that in typical use (including all the sloppiness humans are prone to) is is 18%!!!!
