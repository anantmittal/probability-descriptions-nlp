                  Game Theory (Part 9)  John Baez  Last time we talked about independence of a pair of outcomes, but we can easily go on and talk about independence of a longer sequence of outcomes.  For example, suppose we have three coins.   Suppose:   the 1st coin has probability \( p_H\) of landing heads up and \( p_T\) of landing tails up;  the 2nd coin has probability \( q_H\) of landing heads up and \( q_T\) of landing tails up;  the 3rd coin has probability \( r_H\) of landing heads up and \( r_T\) of landing tails up.   Suppose we flip all of these coins: the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  What's the probability that we get this sequence of results: \( (H, T, T)\) If the coin flips are independent , the probability is just this product: \( p_H \, q_T \, r_T \) See the pattern?  We just multiply the probabilities.  And there's nothing special about coins here, or the number three . We could flip a coin, roll a die, pick a card, and see if it's raining outside. For example, what's the probability that we get heads with our coin, the number 6 on our die, an ace of spades with our cards, and it's raining? If these outcomes are independent , we just calculate: the probability that we get heads, times
the probability that we roll a 6, times
the probability that we get an ace of spades, times
the probability that it's raining outside. Let's solve some puzzles using this idea! Three flips of a fair coin Example 1. Suppose you have a fair coin: this means it has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up.  Suppose you flip it three times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up, then tails up, then heads up? We're asking about the probability of this outcome: \( (H, T, H)\) Since the flips are independent this is \( p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H \, p_T \, p_H \) Since the coin is fair we have \( \displaystyle{ p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2} } \) so \(  \displaystyle{ p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} } \) So the answer is 1/8, or 12.5%. Example 2. In the same situation, what's the probability that the coin lands heads up exactly twice? There are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 outcomes that can happen: \( (H,H,H) \)
\( (H,H,T), \; (H,T,H), \; (T,H,H) \)
\( (H,T,T), \; (T,H,T), \; (T,T,H) \)
\( (T,T,T) \) We can work out the probability of each of these outcomes.  For example, we've already seen that \( (H,T,H)\) is \( \displaystyle{ p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{8} }\) since the coin is fair and the flips are independent.  In fact, all 8 probabilities work out the same way.  We always get 1/8.  In other words, each of the 8 outcomes is equally likely! But we're interested in the probability that we get exactly two heads.  That's the probability of this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) Using the rule we saw in Part 7 , this probability is \( \displaystyle{ p(S) = p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) So the answer is 3/8, or 37.5%. I could have done this a lot faster.  I could say "there are 8 outcomes that can happen, each equally likely, and three that give us two heads, so the probability is 3/8."   But I wanted to show you how we're just following rules we've already seen! Three flips of a very unfair coin Example 3. Now suppose we have an unfair coin with a 90% chance of landing heads up and 10% chance of landing tails up!  What's the probability that if we flip it three times, it lands heads up exactly twice?  Again let's assume the coin flips are independent. Most of the calculation works exactly the same way, but now our coin has \( \displaystyle{ p_H = 0.9, \quad p_T = 0.1 } \) We're interested in the outcomes where the coin comes up heads twice, so we look at this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) The probability of this subset is \( \begin{array}{ccl} p(S) &=& p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} \\  &=& p_T \, p_H  \, p_H + p_H \, p_T \, p_H + p_H \, p_H \, p_T \\ &=& 3 p_T p_H^2 \\ &=& 3 \times 0.1 \times 0.9^2 \\ &=& 0.3 \times 0.81 \\ &=& 0.243 \end{array}\) So now the probability is just 24.3%. Six flips of a fair coin Example 4. Suppose you have a fair coin.  Suppose you flip it six times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up exactly twice? We did a similar problem already, where we flipped the coin three times.  Go back and look at that if you forget!  The answer to that problem was \( \displaystyle{ 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) Why?  Here's why: there were 3 ways to get two heads when you flipped 3 coins, and each of these outcomes had probability \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} }\) We can do our new problem the same way.  Count the number of ways to get two heads when we flip six coins.  Then multiply this by \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} }\) The hard part is to count how many ways we can get two heads when we flip six coins.  To get good at probabilities, we have to get good at counting.  It's boring to list all the outcomes we're trying to count: (H,H,T,T,T,T), (H,T,H,T,T,T), (H,T,T,H,T,T), ... So let's try to come up with a better idea. We have to pick 2 out of our 6 flips to be H's.  How many ways are there to do this? There are 6 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, and then 5 ways left over to pick another and draw a blue H on it... letting the rest be T's.  For example: (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, we've got 6 × 5 = 30 choices.  But we don't really care which H is red and which H is blue—that's just a trick to help us solve the problem.  For example, we don't want to count (T, H , T, T, H , T) as different from (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, there aren't really 30 ways to get two heads.  There are only half as many!  There are 15 ways. So, the probability of getting two heads when we flip the coin six times is \( \displaystyle{ 15 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{15}{64} \approx .234 } \) where the squiggle means 'approximately'.  So: about 23.4%. Binomial coefficients Now for some jargon, which will help when we do harder problems like this.  We say there are 6 choose 2 ways to choose 2 out of 6 things, and we write this as \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2} } \) This sort of number is called a binomial coefficient . We've just shown that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2}  = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 }\) Why write it like this funky fraction: \( \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}\)?  Because it'll help us see the pattern for doing harder problems like this! Nine flips of a fair coin If we flip a fair coin 9 times, and the flips are independent, what's the probability that we get heads exactly 6 times? This works just like the last problem, only the numbers are bigger.  So, I'll do it faster! When we flip the coin 9 times there are \( 2^9\) possible outcomes that can happen.   Each of these is equally likely if it's a fair coin and the flips are independent.  So each has probability \( \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{2^9} } \) To get the answer, we need to multiply this by the number of ways we can get heads exactly 6 times.  This number is called '9 choose 6' or \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6}  }\) for short.  It's the number of ways we can choose 6 things out of a collection of 9. So we just need to know: what's 9 choose 6?  We can work this out as before.  There are 9 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, then 8 ways left to pick another and draw a blue H on it, and 7 ways left to pick a third and draw a orange H on it.  That sounds like 9 × 8 × 7. But we've overcounted!   After all, we don't care about the colors.  We don't care about the difference between this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) and this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) In fact we've counted each possibility 6 times!  Why six?   The first H could be red, green or blue — that's 3 choices.  But then the second H could be either of the two remaining 2 colors... and for the third, we just have 1 choice.  So there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to permute the colors. So, the actual number of ways to get 6 heads out of 9 coin flips is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) In other words: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) To get the answer to our actual problem, remember we need to multiply \( 1/2^9\) by this.  So the answer is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6} }\) If you're a pure mathematician, you can say you're done now.  But normal people won't understand this answer, so let's calculate it out.  I hope you know the first ten powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.  So: \( \displaystyle{ 2^9 = 512 }\) I hope you can also do basic arithmetic like this: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84} \) So, the probability of getting 6 heads when you do 9 independent flips of a fair coin is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6}  = \frac{84}{512} = 0.164025 } \) or 16.4025%. I broke down and used a calculator at the last step.   We're becoming serious nerds here. Okay, that's enough for now.  We've been counting how many ways we can get a certain number of heads from a certain number of coin flips.  What we're realy doing is taking a set of coin flips, say \( n\) of them, and choosing a subset of \( k\) of them to be heads.  So, we say Definition. The binomial coefficient  \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} } \) called \( n\) choose \( k,\) is the number of ways of choosing a subset of \( k\) things from a set of \( n\) things. We have seen in some examples that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1} } \) Here there's a product of \( k\) consecutive numbers on top, and \( k\) on bottom too.  We didn't prove this is true in general, but it's not hard to see, using the tricks we've used already.

Sunday, March 29, 2009  Have you ever flipped a coin as a way of deciding something with another person? The answer is probably yes. And you probably did so assuming you were getting a fair deal, because, as everybody knows, a coin is equally likely to show heads or tails after a single flip—unless it's been shaved or weighted or has a week-old smear of coffee on its underbelly.   So when your friend places a coin on his thumb and says "call it in the air", you realize that it doesn't really matter whether you pick heads or tails. Every person has a preference, of course—heads or tails might feel "luckier" to you—but logically the chances are equal.  Or are they?   Granted, everybody knows that newly-minted coins are born with tiny imperfections, minute deviations introduced by the fabrication process. Everybody knows that, over time, a coin will wear and tear, picking up scratches, dings, dents, bacteria, and finger-grease. And everybody knows that these imperfections can affect the physics of the coin flip, biasing the results by some infinitesimal amount which in practice we ignore.  But let's assume that's not the case.  Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer . And, since it's possible to train one's thumb to flip a coin such that it comes up heads or tails a huge percentage of the time, let's assume the person flipping the coin isn't a magician or a prestidigitator. In other words, let's assume both a perfect coin and an honest toss, such as the kind you might make with a friend to decide who pays for lunch.  In that case there's an absolute right and wrong answer to the age-old question...  Heads or tails?  ...because the two outcomes of a typical coin flip are not equally likely.  The 50-50 proposition is actually more of a 51-49 proposition, if not worse. The sacred coin flip exhibits (at minimum) a whopping 1% bias , and possibly much more. 1% may not sound like a lot, but it's more than the typical casino edge in a game of blackjack or slots. What's more, you can take advantage of this little-known fact to give yourself an edge in all future coin-flip battles.  The Physics of Coin Flipping  In the 31-page Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss , Persi Diaconis, Susan Holmes, and Richard Montgomery lay out the theory and practice of coin-flipping to a degree that's just, well, downright intimidating.   Suffice to say their approach involved a lot of physics, a lot of math, motion-capture cameras, random experimentation, and an automated "coin-flipper" device capable of flipping a coin and producing Heads 100% of the time.   Here are the broad strokes of their research:   If the coin is tossed and caught , it has about a 51% chance of landing on the same face it was launched. (If it starts out as heads, there's a 51% chance it will end as heads).  If the coin is spun, rather than tossed , it can have a much-larger-than-50% chance of ending with the heavier side down. Spun coins can exhibit "huge bias" (some spun coins will fall tails-up 80% of the time).  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor , this probably adds randomness.  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor where it spins , as will sometimes happen, the above spinning bias probably comes into play.  A coin will land on its edge around 1 in 6000 throws , creating a flipistic singularity .  The same initial coin-flipping conditions produce the same coin flip result . That is, there's a certain amount of determinism to the coin flip.  A more robust coin toss (more revolutions) decreases the bias .   The 51% figure in Premise 1 is a bit curious and, when I first saw it, I assumed it was a minor bias introduced by the fact that the "heads" side of the coin has more decoration than the "tails" side, making it heavier. But it turns out that this sort of imbalance has virtually no effect unless you spin the coin on its edge, in which case you'll see a huge bias. The reason a typical coin toss is 51-49 and not 50-50 has nothing to do with the asymmetry of the coin and everything to do with the aggregate amount of time the coin spends in each state, as it flips through space.  A good way of thinking about this is by looking at the ratio of odd numbers to even numbers when you start counting from 1.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  No matter how long you count, you'll find that at any given point, one of two things will be true:   You've touched more odd numbers than even numbers  You've touched an equal amount of odd numbers and even numbers   What will never happen, is this:   You've touched more even numbers than odd numbers.   Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether:  H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Heads state. In the aggregate, it's slightly more likely that the coin shows Heads at a given point in time—including whatever time the coin is caught. And vice-versa if you start the coin-flip from the Tails position.  The Strategy of Coin Flipping  Unlike the article on the edge in a game of blackjack mentioned previously, I've never seen a description of "coin flipping strategy" which takes the above science into count. When it's a true 50-50 toss, there is no strategy. But if we take it as granted, or at least possible, that a coin flip does indeed exhibit a 1% or more bias, then the following rules of thumb might apply.   Always be the chooser, if possible . This allows you to leverage Premise 1 or Premise 2 for those extra percentage points.  Always be the tosser , if you can. This protects you from virtuoso coin-flippers who are able to leverage Premise 6 to produce a desired outcome. It also protects you against the added randomness (read: fairness) introduced by flippers who will occasionally, without rhyme or reason, invert the coin in their palm before revealing. Tricksy Hobbitses.  Don't allow the same person to both toss and choose . Unless, of course, that person is you.  If the coin is being tossed, and you're the chooser, always choose the side that's initially face down . According to Premise 1, you'd always choose the side that's initially face up, but most people, upon flipping a coin, will invert it into their other palm before revealing. Hence, you choose the opposite side, but you get the same 1% advantage. Of course, if you happen to know that a particular flipper doesn't do this, use your better judgment.  If you are the tosser but not the chooser, sometimes invert the coin into your other palm after catching, and sometimes don't . This protects you against people who follow Rule 4 blindly by assuming you'll either invert the coin or you won't.  If the coin is being spun rather than tossed , always choose whichever side is lightest . On a typical coin, the "Heads" side of the coin will have more "stuff" engraved on it, causing Tails to show up more frequently than it should. Choosing Tails in this situation is usually the power play.  Never under any circumstances agree to a coin spin if you're not the chooser . This opens you up to a devastating attack if your opponent is aware of Premise 2.   I hope I've made it clear that none of this is really to be taken seriously. The point is that adding even 1% of wobble to a situation of pure chance can create a lot of additional complexity, and that in turn, can create strategy where none existed before.  Tags: probability , coin flipping    54 comment(s)   Great little article. I very much enjoyed this.  I would add to your "coin flip strategy" that if you suspect you're facing a "virtuoso tosser" and he won't let you do the toss, make him toss it on the ground.  Cheers.   Heads I Win Tails You Lose on Sunday, March 29, 2009   Lol. Interesting.  I may be mistaken here, but I believe your term "one vigintillionth of a yoctometer" is below the Plank length, making it so small as to be meaningless. Been a while since I looked at this stuff (college in fact) but...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length   Anonymous Coward on Sunday, March 29, 2009   that's the point.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, October 17, 2011   Awesome article. Really enjoyed reading it and having a break from the indepth computer science. Thanks.   Poker Forums on Monday, March 30, 2009   One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should atleast adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.  Jokes aside, nice article. For a moment, I was thinking that, even given your explanation of the inherent bias, it doesn't make sense since the coin would never land in the position it started at without flipping, as that would really be an invalid flip. But then, I guess all you do is move the minimum number of flips ahead to 2 or 3, and the state of the coin there is your new "initial" state, and you can set up the same argument. Nice.  However, I wonder what the case would be if one started the coin at a half-flip, on its edge? You might say that the initial face would correspond to the next face to show up after it performs a half-flip. But instead of a half-flip, what if you had just behind a half-flip? What about a quarter flip? I don't know a good line of reasoning to take care of these cases, it almost seems arbitrary.  And of course, it's totally pointless too. But who cares, interesting nonetheless!   ehsanul on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   [i]>One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should at least adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.[/i]  Yes, major fail. Guilty! But more memorable than "down to the last molecule/nanometer/etc". I got the idea for the phrase from Neal Stephenson's book in which the villain has a knife with an edge "one molecule wide".  If you managed to flip the coin from the edge position (let E represent the edge state):  E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H  I still think the sequence exhibits the clumping shown above, because the coin spends only a tiny fraction of its time in those E states (it's really only in E when it's perfectly vertical). Because the aggregate time in E is so small, the probabilities would still favor whatever state immediately followed the initial E state (in this case, heads). At least, it seems you could make the argument.   Coding the Wheel on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Another strategy. If not obvious:   If you are the tosser, and not the chooser, flip the coin into your palm after the toss only if they pick the face up side.    James R on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   You missed an important strategy.  I used to earn lunch money in high school thusly:
I could flip a coin to come out "heads" about 90% of the time (with practice, same as knife throwing, control # of flips through the air during a certain time between flip and catch).  Anyhow, I flip, you call while in the air.
I catch and you most always lose because after you call it in the air, I choose to catch, or catch and invert (your #5. above). You assume it was fair because you called it in the air. No one ever figured out what I was doing (or I would have been beaten up!).   Comfortable on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Persi Diaconis is also the guy who did the (often-misquoted) research into how many times you should shuffle a deck of cards.   bmm6o on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   So, to paraphrase Vizzini:  "But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the coin into his own hand or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the coin into his own hand, because he would know that only a great fool would request to make the call. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the side facing up. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the side facing down."  But we all know how Vizzini ended up. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha...   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Just found your blog and have read quite a few of your posts - excellent job.  I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however.  In fact the paper does show that a coin flipped without precession does have a 50/50 chance (even though your H T H T H T H argument would still apply).  But with precession the coin will spend a greater frequency of it's time in the starting position (in fact with enough precession it will appear to flip but be 100% in the up position - alas I can not seem to master that).  If you take a coin and manually flip it end over end while precessing it at the same time you can kind of visualize this.  In the case without precession it's irrelevant that it starts as heads or tails.  What's relevant is that after flipping the coin spends equal amounts of time in the air in both states.  Again with precession this is not true.  Apparently their experiments showed that a typical coin flip done by hand precesses enough to give the 1% bias.   Anonymous Coward on Saturday, April 04, 2009   How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?  Seems low to my thinking. BTW, happened to me, a long time ago over who buys the next pitcher of beer.  I never met anyone else who has seen a coin land on its edge.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, April 06, 2009   [i]>I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however. In fact the paper does show that[/i]  You're right. The entire argument is an oversimplification.  [i]>How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?[/i]  That figure was for a nickel and I think it would be less for other coins. It was buried on page 10 of [url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf]Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss[/url] which references [url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993PhRvE..48.2547M]the original research[/url]. There's also some other [url=http://www.google.com/search?q=coin+landing+on+edge]research[/url] on this.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, April 06, 2009   A couple days ago I flipped a coin (nickel) and it landed, rolled, and stayed on edge. It was a new nickel and a flat (glass) table but it happened.  One of the more interesting "light reading" posts I've come across in weeks.   jzx on Wednesday, April 08, 2009   I'm neither a mathematician nor a physicist, having found my way here via the link from Freakonomics (I suppose I should say I'm not an economist either), but I think the HTHT analysis would lead to a conclusion opposite to the one given here.  If we assume that the coin is in fact flipped, and not simply "moved from Point A to Point B by a process that may or may not involve flipping," then isn't it correct to deem the initial state of a flipped coin as being 180 degrees revolved from its state in the flipper's hand? If so (and that seems right to me), the HTHT analysis leads to the conclusion that the side of the coin more likely to be up at the end of the flip is the side that was down in the flipper's hands.   DBH on Thursday, April 16, 2009   I would appreciate a strategy for Two-up
Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated 'Spinner' throwing two coins into the air. Traditionally, these coins are pennies. Incidentally, their weight size and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the 'kip' and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and they don't 'fly' so well. The design of pennies that date pre 1939 had the soveriegns head on the obverse(front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing making the result very easy and quick to see. Pennies can often be obseved being used at games on Anzac Day, they are and brought out specifically for the purpose each year.  Players gamble on whether the coins will fall with both (obverse) heads up, both (reverse) tails up, or with one coin a head, and one a tail (known as 'Odds'). It is traditionally played on ANZAC Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages.   Pablo Uribe on Monday, April 27, 2009   "Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer."  Its not. The research is highly biased based on the perfect flip and the coin not being a perfect coin.  On top of this, the coin may be flipped 500 million times showing a 51-49, but you could flip it 1 trillion times resulting in 50-50.  If I gave Sally half my meal, am I left with 49% or 50%? Yeah...  If anything, its more likely the coin has a 49.99999999....-49.9999999 probability, giving room for the randomness of variables like the blatant bias in this research.   Anonymous Coward on Friday, July 31, 2009   Impresive reasearch man...   John on Monday, August 03, 2009   The aggregate time hypothesis doesn't work. If you just shift the frame to the, say, third flip in the air - since it's highly unlikely that the coin will land before it's third flip - you'll get the same argument reversed. I.e., if I start with heads, let it flip 3 times with tails up, and then start counting aggregate time, I'll get a THTHTHTHT... pattern and tails will now win 51% of the time.   Nyet on Monday, August 24, 2009   I used to work with a guy who was sure that coins had memory.  To him if you had a fair coin and you flipped it 100 times and got heads the odds would be better that you would get a tail on the next flip.  No matter how I explained it to him he would not believe that it was still 50/50.  I asked him how the coin "remembered what it's last 100 flips were?"   Sitelinker on Monday, August 24, 2009   Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame!  "A weaker man might be moved to re-examine his faith, if in nothing else at least in the law of probability."  Fascinating piece, by the way.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm afraid that the HTHTH... argument appears to me to be completely bogus.  The only reason that there might be one more heads is that you decided to start counting on heads. Why did you start counting on heads? Because that was what was showing in the beginning, when it was resting on the thumb.  But you could equally argue that that is the very worst place to start counting. A coin flip isn't a coin flip if it doesn't leave the thumb. Indeed, it has to have at least one flip. Therefore, it is completely impossible that the first H would ever be counted.  So you could make an equally good argument saying  [quote]Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether. After the first flip, naturally, it will be on Tails:  T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Tails state.[/quote]  This argument sounds just as reasonable as the first one, if not more so, which implies to me that the whole argument doesn't work.  Note that if this [b]did[/b] make sense, then the coin would show a bias of much, much more than 51%, because the coin would have to flip at least 100 times before the effect of that "first side" bias, were it true, was as low as 1%. Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame![/i]  I thought long and hard about it. Seriously. Great movie.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjOqaD5tWB0#t=0m50  [i]>Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).
[/i]  Yes. Excellent points. The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate, not necessarily meant to be an accurate portrayal of the physics. For example, if you flip the coin for say 1.5 revolutions it's obviously not approximating 51-49. This was a device, but an innocent one.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate[/i]  Yes, but you do specifically say that the reason (according to you) that the coin spends more of its time on "Heads" is that there are more H's then T's in your sequence, and that this is because you started with "H."  Simplification or not, this is fundamentally a wrong way to look at it, as several people have said. The problem with your approach is that it all depends on where you start counting, and you can pick wherever you want depending on what you want to prove, which is not good physics. The article doesn't suggest your explanation.  Although the article doesn't appear to suggest any explanation, a better explanation of the idea that the coin spends more time on one face than the other "in aggregate" would be one where this really is displayed where ever you start counting from. For example, the following argument, though not necessarily true, displays this property:  [quote]"Due to the asymmetry of flipping, the coin spends more time in the 360 degree flipped position than the 180 degree flipped position. If we write out the sequence showing what face is showing at time T, with the dT between values being 0.01 s, it would look like  ....2211111122211111222111111222...  as you can see, it spends more time on the first face ("1") than the second, so is more likely to be caught when displaying the first face."[/quote]  This argument, while probably incorrect and not supported by the article, at least is an explanation that doesn't depend on whether you start counting when the coin being on your thumb or after the first flip.   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm surprised no one mentioned (or at least I didn't notice) the fair coin flip where it doesn't matter whether the coin is biased or not. It can be done in the following way:  Flip coin two times. If it ends up HT or TH, the result is the first one of the sequence. If it ends up HH or TT, continue flipping it again two times until you get HT or TH.  p(1-p) = (1-p)p   Stephen on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Agree with Stephen. Good idea!  Disagree with SamSam: the research clearly states the coin is biased based on where it starts.  Disagree with the author: it has nothing to do with aggregate time. The precession/wobbling of the coin around it's horizontal center of gravity is what creates the bias. At least that's my reading of the research.  You're all wrong.   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Very nice written, very clear and contains useful link to original research...only one problem with the above that seemed to me immediately clear:  there's no  empirical data supporting it's main conclusion of a 1% bias. Not even "my friend Jim and other graduate  students tossed a coin drawn from circulation ..." With a Ph.D in probability theory from Oxford I persisted and skimmed the origianl research (I have been developing my skimming skills by working on the redacted parts of the CIA's Inspector General's report - I have become most adept at getting through the large black blanks.) Low and behold I find in the original article on page 10 the staement that no empirical data has been found to support the hypothesis.  The coins studied have been gussied up like kids  going to a party... faces painted, ribbons attached etc. Without real experiments on mature coins (those drawn from circulation), the conclusions here seems highly questionable.

Starting on H and assuming a constant spin rate & time on one side = t, the ratio of time on each side would be H t, H t:T t, H 2t:T t, H 2t:T 2t, H 3t:T*2t,...  (that's 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:1, 3:2, 1:1, 4:3, 1:1, 5:4, 1:1, 6:5, 1:1, 7:6,...)

Greater only means greater = not less than or equal to.  While I think it was fair to say the odds increased. Quantifying the increase involved voodoo & was clearly used for illustrative purposes only.  Great article! A+  and Bruce sent me, too :-)   DoNoEvil on Thursday, October 15, 2009   Great article.

Well, in that case the probability of it ending up in a the state it started in would be  51% only if there were about 100 flips in the air. However, I'm sure the actual number of flips when you flip a coin is more than that? Has anyone measured this? In that case, the offset is probably a lot less than 1%.

Home | About | Contact | Subscribe  Copyright © 2011 | All Rights Reserved     Introduction to Probability and Statistics    Calculation and Chance  Most experimental searches for paranormal phenomena are statistical in
nature.  A subject repeatedly attempts a task with a known probability
of success due to chance, then the number of actual successes is compared
to the chance expectation.  If a subject scores consistently higher or
lower than the chance expectation after a large number of attempts,
one can calculate the probability of such a score due purely to
chance, and then argue, if the chance probability is sufficiently
small, that the results are evidence for the existence of some
mechanism (precognition, telepathy, psychokinesis, cheating, etc.)
which allowed the subject to perform better than chance would seem to
permit.  Suppose you ask a subject to guess, before it is flipped, whether a
coin will land with heads or tails up.  Assuming the coin is fair (has
the same probability of heads and tails), the chance of guessing
correctly is 50%, so you'd expect half the guesses to be correct and
half to be wrong.  So, if we ask the subject to guess heads or tails
for each of 100 coin flips, we'd expect about 50 of the guesses to be
correct.  Suppose a new subject walks into the lab and manages to
guess heads or tails correctly for 60 out of 100 tosses.  Evidence of
precognition, or perhaps the subject's possessing a telekinetic power
which causes the coin to land with the guessed face up?  Well,…no.
In all likelihood, we've observed nothing more than good luck.  The
probability of 60 correct guesses out of 100 is about 2.8%, which
means that if we do a large number of experiments flipping 100 coins,
about every 35 experiments we can expect a score of 60 or better,
purely due to chance.  But suppose this subject continues to guess about 60 right
out of a hundred, so that after ten runs of 100 tosses—1000
tosses in all, the subject has made 600 correct guesses.
The probability of that happening purely by chance is less
than one in seven billion, so it's time to start thinking
about explanations other than luck.  Still, improbable things
happen all the time: if you hit a golf ball, the odds it
will land on a given blade of grass are millions to one, yet
(unless it ends up in the lake or a sand trap) it is
certain to land on some blades of grass.  Finally, suppose this “dream subject” continues to guess 60%
of the flips correctly, observed by multiple video cameras,
under conditions prescribed by skeptics and debunkers, using
a coin provided and flipped by The Amazing Randi himself, with
a final tally of 1200 correct guesses in 2000 flips.  You'd
have to try the 2000 flips more than 5×10 18 times before you'd expect that result to occur by chance.
If it takes a day to do 2000 guesses and coin flips, it
would take more than 1.3×10 16 years of
2000 flips per day before you'd expect to see 1200 correct
guesses due to chance.  That's more than a million times
the age of the universe, so you'd better get started soon!  Claims of evidence for the paranormal are usually based upon
statistics which diverge so far from the expectation due to chance
that some other mechanism seems necessary to explain the experimental
results.  To interpret the results of our RetroPsychoKinesis
experiments, we'll be using the mathematics of probability and
statistics, so it's worth spending some time explaining how we go
about quantifying the consequences of chance.     Note to mathematicians: The following discussion of probability
is deliberately simplified to consider only binomial and normal distributions
with a probability of 0.5, the presumed probability of success in
the experiments in question.  I decided that
presenting and discussing the equations for arbitrary probability
would only decrease the probability that readers would persevere
and arrive at an understanding of the fundamentals of probability
theory.    Twelve and a half cents: one bit!  In slang harking back to the days of gold doubloons and pieces of
eight, the United States quarter-dollar coin is nicknamed “two bits”.
The Fourmilab radioactive random
number generator produces a stream of binary ones and zeroes, or bits .  Since we expect the generator to produce ones and
zeroes with equal probability, each bit from the generator is
equivalent to a coin flip: heads for one and tails for zero.  When we run
experiments with the generator, in effect, we're flipping a binary coin , one bit —twelve and a
half cents!     Two Bits    One Bit            Heads  Tails    Heads  Tails     (We could, of course, have called zero heads and one tails; since both
occur with equal probability, the choice is arbitrary.) Each bit
produced by the random number generator is a flip of our one-bit coin.
Now the key thing to keep in mind about a genuine random number
generator or flip of a fair coin is that it has no memory or,
as mathematicians say, each bit from the generator or flip is independent .  Even if, by chance, the coin has come up heads
ten times in a row, the probability of getting heads or tails on the
next flip is precisely equal.  Gamblers who've seen a coin come up
heads ten times in a row may believe “tails is way overdue”, but the
coin doesn't know and couldn't care less about the last ten flips; the
next flip is just as likely to be the eleventh head in a row as the
tail that breaks the streak.  Even though there is no way whatsoever to predict the outcome of the
next flip, if we flip a coin a number of times, the laws of
probability allow us to predict, with greater accuracy as the number
of flips increases, the probability of obtaining various results.  In
the discussion that follows, we'll ignore the order of the flips and
only count how many times the coin came up heads.  Since heads is one
and tails is zero, we can just add up the results from the flips, or
the bits from the random generator.  Four Flips  Suppose we flip a coin four times.  Since each flip can come up heads
or tails, there are 16 possible outcomes, tabulated below, grouped by
the number of heads in the four flips.     Number of Heads  Results of Flips  Number of Ways    0       1    1                       4    2                                 6    3                       4    4       1      Number of Ways summarises how many different ways the results
of the four flips could end up with a given number of heads.  Since
the only way to get zero heads is for all four flips to be tails,
there's only one way that can occur.  One head out of four flips can
happen four different ways since each of the four flips could have
been the head.  Two heads out of four flips can happen six different
ways, as tabulated.  And since what's true of heads applies equally to
tails, there are four ways to get three heads and one way to get four.  Mathematically, the number of ways to get x heads (or tails) in n flips is spoken of as
the “number of combinations of n things taken x at a time”, which is written as:     This, it turns out, can be calculated for any positive integers n and x whatsoever, as follows.     For example, if we plug in 4 for n and 2 for x ,
we get  4! / (2! (4 − 2)!) = 4! / (2! 2!) = 24 / (2 2) = 24 / 4 = 6  as expected.
Plotting the number of ways we can get different numbers of
heads yields the following graph.     Probability  Since the coin is fair, each flip has an equal chance of coming up
heads or tails, so all 16 possible outcomes tabulated above are
equally probable.  But since there are 6 ways to get 2 heads, in four
flips the probability of two heads is greater than that of
any other result.  We express probability as a number between 0 and 1.
A probability of zero is a result which cannot ever occur: the
probability of getting five heads in four flips is zero.  A
probability of one represents certainty: if you flip a coin, the
probability you'll get heads or tails is one (assuming it
can't land on the rim,  fall into a black hole, or some such).  The probability of getting a given number of heads from
four flips is, then, simply the number of ways that
number of heads can occur, divided by the number of total
results of four flips, 16.  We can then tabulate the
probabilities as follows.     Number of Heads  Number of Ways  Probability    0  1  1/16 = 0.0625    1  4  4/16 = 0.25    2  6  6/16 = 0.375    3  4  4/16 = 0.25    4  1  1/16 = 0.0625     Since we are absolutely certain the number of heads we get in four
flips is going to be between zero and four, the probabilities of the
different numbers of heads should add up to 1.  Summing the
probabilities in the table confirms this.  Further, we can calculate
the probability of any collection of results by adding the individual
probabilities of each.  Suppose we'd like to know the probability of
getting fewer than three heads from four flips.  There are three ways
this can happen: zero, one, or two heads.  The probability of fewer
than three, then, is the sum of the probabilities of these results,
1/16 + 4/16 + 6/16 = 11/16 = 0.6875, or a little more than two out of
three.  So to calculate the probability of one outcome or another, sum the probabilities.  To get probability of one result and another from two
separate experiments, multiply the individual
probabilities.  The probability of getting one head in four flips is
4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25.  What's the probability of getting one head in each
of two successive sets of four flips?  Well, it's just 1/4 × 1/4 =
1/16 = 0.0625.  The probability for any number of heads x in
any number of flips n is thus:     the number of ways in which x heads can occur
in n flips, divided by the number of different possible
results of the series of flips, measured by number of heads.
But there's no need to sum the combinations in the denominator,
since the number of possible results is simply two raised
to the power of the number of flips.  So, we can simplify
the expression for the probability to:     More Flips  Let's see how the probability behaves as we make more and more flips.
Since we have a general formula for calculating the probability for
any number of heads in any number of flips, we can graph of the
probability for various numbers of flips.   8 Flips  16 Flips  32 Flips  64 Flips  128 Flips   In every case, the peak probability is at half the number of flips and
declines on both sides, more steeply as the number of flips increases.
This is the simple consequence of there being many more possible ways
for results close to half heads and tails to occur than ways that
result in a substantial majority of heads or tails.
The RPKP experiments involve a sequence of 1024
random bits, in which the most probable results form a narrow
curve centred at 512.  A document giving
probabilities for results of 1024 bit experiments with
chance expectations greater than one in 100 thousand million
runs is available , as is a much
larger table listing probabilities for
all possible results .  (The latter document is more than 150K bytes
and will take a while to download, and contains a very large
table which some Web browsers, particularly on machines with
limited memory, may not display properly.)  Perfectly Normal  As we make more and more flips, the graph of the probability of a
given number of heads becomes smoother and approaches the
“bell curve”, or normal distribution , as a limit.  The
normal distribution gives the probability for x heads
in n flips as:     where μ= n /2 and
σ is the standard deviation , a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for equal probability coin flipping, is:     We keep the standard deviation separate, as opposed to merging it into
the normal distribution probability equation, because it will play an
important rôle in interpreting the results of our experiments.  To
show how closely the probability chart approaches the normal
distribution even for a relatively small number of flips, here's the
normal distribution plotted in red, with the actual probabilities for
number of heads in 128 flips shown as blue bars.     The probability the outcome of an experiment with

Probability Calculator .  Calculation and Reality  This is all very persuasive, you might say, and the formulas are
suitably intimidating, but does the real world actually behave this
way?  Well, as a matter of fact, it does, as we can see from a simple
experiment.  Get a coin, flip it 32 times, and write down the number
of times heads came up.  Now repeat the experiment fifty thousand
times.  When you're done, make a graph of the number of 32-flip sets
which resulted in a given number of heads.  Hmmmm…32 times
50,000 is 1.6 million, so if you flip the coin once a second,
twenty-four hours per day, it'll take eighteen and a half days to
complete the experiment….  Instead of marathon coin-flipping, let's use the same HotBits hardware random number generator our
experiments employ.  It's a simple matter of programming to withdraw
1.6 million bits from the generator, divide them up into 50,000 sets
of 32 bits each, then compute a histogram of the number of sets
containing each possible number of one bits (heads).  The results from
this experiment are presented in the following graph.     The red curve is the number of runs expected to result in each value
of heads, which is simply the probability of that number of heads
multiplied by the total number of experimental runs, 50,000.  The blue
diamonds are the actual number of 32 bit sets observed to contain each
number of one bits.  It is evident that the experimental results
closely match the expectation from probability.  Just as the
probability curve approaches the normal distribution for large numbers
of runs, experimental results from a truly random source will
inexorably converge on the predictions of probability as the number of
runs increases.   If
your Web browser supports Java applets, our Probability Pipe
Organ lets you run interactive experiments which demonstrate how
the results from random data approach the normal
curve expectation as the number of experiments grows large.   Experiments and Expectations  Performing an experiment amounts to asking the Universe a
question.  For the answer, the experimental results, to be
of any use, you have to be absolutely sure you've phrased the
question correctly.  When searching for elusive effects
among a sea of random events by statistical means, whether
in particle physics or parapsychology, one must take care
to apply statistics properly to the events being studied.
Misinterpreting genuine experimental results yields errors
just as serious as those due to faults in the design of the
experiment.  Evidence for the existence of a phenomenon must be significant , persistent , and consistent .
Statistical analysis can never entirely rule out the
possibility that the results of an experiment were entirely due to
chance—it can only calculate the probability of occurrence by
chance.  Only as more and more experiments are performed, which
reproduce the supposed effect and, by doing so, further decrease the
probability of chance, does the evidence for the effect become
persuasive.  To show how essential it is to ask the right question, consider an
experiment in which the subject attempts to influence a device which
generates random digits from 0 to 9 so that more nines are generated
than expected by chance.  Each experiment involves generation of one
thousand random digits.  We run the first experiment and get the
following result:   51866599999944246273322297520235159670265786865762

(we'll see how to calculate this numerically before long).
There was an excess of nines over the chance expectation, 100,
but greater excesses occurred for the digits 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .  But take a look at the first line of
the results!  518665 999999 44246273322297520235159670265786865762
                            .
                            .
                            .  These digits were supposed to be random , yet in the first
thousand, the first dozen for that matter, we found a pattern as
striking as “999999”.  What's the probability of that happening?  Just
the number of possible numbers of d digits which contain one
or more sequences of p or more consecutive nines:     Plugging in 1000 for d and 6 for p yields:     So the probability of finding “999999” in a set of 1000 random digits
is less than one in a thousand!  So then, are the digits not random,
after all?  Might our subject, while failing to influence the outcome
of the experiment in the way we've requested, have somehow marked the
results with a signature of a thousand-to-one probability of appearing
by chance?  Or have we simply asked the wrong question and gotten a
perfectly accurate answer that doesn't mean what we think it does at
first glance?  The latter turns out to be the case.  The data are right before our
eyes, and the probability we calculated is correct, but we asked
the wrong question , and in doing so fell into a trap littered
with the bones of many a naïve researcher.  Note the order in which we
did things.  We ran the experiment, examined the data, found something
seemingly odd in it, then calculated the probability of that
particular oddity appearing by chance.  We asked the question,
“ What is the probability of ‘999999’ appearing in a 1000 digit
random sequence? ” and got the answer “less than one in a
thousand”, a result most people would consider significant.  But since
we calculated the probability after seeing the data, in fact we were
asking the question “ What is the chance that ‘999999’ appears in a
1000 digit random sequence which contains one occurrence of
‘999999’?” .  The answer to that question is, of course,
“certainty”.  In the original examination of the data, we were really asking
“ What is the probability we'll find some striking sequence
of six digits in a random 1000 digit number? ”.  We can't
precisely quantify that without defining what “striking” means to the
observer, but it is clearly quite high.  Consider that I could have
made the case just as strongly for “000000”, “777777” or any other
six-digit repeat.  That alone reduces the probability of occurrence by
chance to one in ten.  Or, perhaps I might have pointed out a run of
digits like “123456”, “012345”, “987654”, and so on; or the first five
or six digits of a mathematical constant such as Pi, e, or the square
root of two; regular patterns like “101010”, “123321”, or a multitude
of others; or maybe my telephone or license plate number, or the
subject's!  It is, in fact, very likely you'll find some pattern you consider striking in a random 1000-digit number.  But, of course, if you don't examine the data from an experiment, how
are you going to notice if there's something odd about it?  Now we'll
see how a hypothesis is framed, tested by a series of experiments, and
confirmed or rejected by statistical analysis of the results.  So,
let's pursue this a bit further, exploring how we frame a hypothesis
based on an observation, run experiments to test it, and then analyse the
results to determine whether they confirm or
deny the hypothesis, and to what degree of certainty.  Our observation, based on examining the first thousand random digits,
is that “999999” appears once, while the probability of “999999”
appearing in a randomly chosen 1000 digit number is less than one in a
thousand.  Based on this observation we then suggest:    Hypothesis:  The sequence “999999” appears more frequently
in 1000-digit sequences with the subject attempting to influence
the generator than would be expected by chance.    We can now proceed to test this experimentally.  If the sequence
“999999” has a probability of occurring in a 1000 digit sequence of
0.000995, then for a thousand consecutive 1000 digit sequences (a
million digits in all), the probability of “999999” appearing will
be 0.995, almost unity. (To be correct, it's important
to test each 1000 digit sequence separately, then sum the results for
1000 consecutive sequences.  If we were to scan all million digits as
one sequence, we would count cases where the sequence “999999” begins
in one 1000 digit sequence and ends in the next.  The probability
(which you can calculate from the equation above) of finding “999999”
in a million digit sequence is 0.999995, somewhat higher than the
0.995 with the million digits are treated as separate 1000 digit
experiments.)   We will perform, then, the following experiment.  With our
ever-patient subject continuing to attempt to influence the output of the
generator, we will produce a million more sequences
of 1000 digits and, in each, count occurrences of “999999”.  Every
1000 sequences, we'll record the number of occurrences,
repeating the process until we've generated a thousand
runs of a million digits—10 9 digits in all.
With that data in hand, we'll see whether the “999999 effect”
is genuine or a fluke attributable to chance.  Here is a plot of the number of occurrences of the sequence “999999”
per block of 1000 digits over the thousand repetitions of the thousand
sequence experiment.  The number of occurrences expected by chance,
0.995, is marked by the green line.     At the outset, the results diverged substantially from chance, as is
frequently the case for small sample sizes.  But as the number of
experiments increased, the results converged toward the chance
expectation, ending up in a decreasing magnitude random walk around
it.  This is precisely what is expected from probability theory, and
hence we conclude no “999999 effect” exists.  Ensembles of Experiments: the X ² (Chi-Square) Test  So far, we've seen how the laws of probability predict the outcome of
large numbers of experiments involving random data, how to calculate
the probability of a given experimental result being due to chance,
and how one goes about framing a hypothesis, then designing and
running a series of experiments to test it.  Now it's time to examine
how to analyse the results from the experiments to determine whether
they provide evidence for the hypothesis and, if so, how much.  Since its introduction in 1900 by Karl Peterson, the chi-square
( X ²) test has become the most widely used measure of the
significance to which experimental results support or refute a
hypothesis.  Applicable to any experiment where discrete results can
be measured, it is used in almost every field of science.  The
chi-square test is the final step in a process which usually proceeds
as follows.   Based either on theory or examination of empirical
        data, a phenomenon is suggested to exist.  A hypothesis is framed incorporating the supposed
        phenomenon.  An experiment is designed to test the hypothesis.
        The experiment must produce results which differ
        based on the validity of the hypothesis.  The
        results of the experiment for the hypothesis-false
        ( null hypothesis ) case are calculated and,
        if appropriate, verified by a control experiment
        in which the hypothesised effect is excluded.  A series of experiments are conducted, and the
        results tabulated.  The chi-square test is applied to determine the
        significance of the discrepancy between the
        calculated null hypothesis case and the
        experimental results, and the probability that
        the discrepancy is the result of chance.  If
        that probability is very low, the experiment
        provides evidence for the hypothesis.   No experiment or series of experiments can ever prove a
hypothesis; one can only rule out other hypotheses and provide
evidence that assuming the truth of the hypothesis better explains the
experimental results than discarding it.  In many fields of science,
the task of estimating the null-hypothesis results can be formidable,
and can lead to prolonged and intricate arguments about the
assumptions involved.  Experiments must be carefully designed to
exclude selection effects which might bias the data.  Fortunately, retropsychokinesis experiments have an easily stated and
readily calculated null hypothesis: “The results will obey the
statistics for a sequence of random bits.” The fact that the data are
prerecorded guarantees (assuming the experiment software is properly
implemented and the results are presented without selection or
modification) that run selection or other forms of cheating cannot
occur.  (Anybody can score better than chance at coin flipping if
they're allowed to throw away experiments that come out poorly!)
Finally, the availability of all the programs in source code form and
the ability of others to repeat the experiments on their own premises
will allow independent confirmation of the results obtained here.  So, as the final step in analysing the results of a collection of n experiments, each with k possible outcomes, we
apply the chi-square test to compare the actual results with the
results expected by chance, which are just, for each outcome, its
probability times the number of experiments n .  Mathematically,
the chi-square statistic for an experiment with k possible outcomes, performed n times, in which Y 1 , Y 2 ,… Y k are the number of
experiments which resulted in each possible outcome, where the
probabilities of each outcome are p 1 ,
p 2 ,… p k is:     It's evident from examining this equation that the closer the
measured values are to those expected, the
lower the chi-square sum will be.  Further, from a chi-square
sum, the probability Q that the X ² sum for an experiment with d degrees of freedom (where d = k −1, one less
the number of possible outcomes) is consistent with the
null hypothesis can be calculated as:     Where Γ is the generalisation of the factorial
function to real and complex arguments:     Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for Q , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  If your Web browser supports
JavaScript, you can use the Chi-Square
Calculator to calculate the probability from a chi-square value
and number of possible outcomes, or calculate the chi-square from the
probability and the number of possible outcomes.  In applying the chi-square test, it's essential to understand that only
very small probabilities of the null hypothesis are significant.
If the probability that the null hypothesis can explain the experimental
results is above 1%, an experiment is generally not considered evidence
of a different hypothesis.  The chi-square test takes
into account neither the number of experiments performed nor the
probability distribution of the expected outcomes; it is valid
only as the number of experiments becomes large, resulting in
substantial numbers for the most probable results.  If a hypothesis
is valid, the chi-square probability should converge on a
small value as more and more experiments are run.  Now let's examine an example of how the chi-square test identifies
experimental results which support or refute a hypothesis.  Our
simulated experiment consists of 50,000 runs of 32 random bits each.
The subject attempts to influence the random number generator to emit
an excess of one or zero bits compared to the chance expectation of
equal numbers of zeroes and ones.  The following table gives the
result of a control run using the random number generator without the
subject's attempting to influence it.  Even if the probability of
various outcomes is easily calculated, it's important to run control
experiments to make sure there are no errors in the experimental
protocol or apparatus which might bias the results away from those
expected.  The table below gives, for each possible number of one
bits, the number of runs which resulted in that count, the expectation
from probability, and the corresponding term in the chi-square sum.
The chi-square sum for the experiment is given at the bottom.

(32, one less than the 33 possible outcomes of the experiment)
into the Chi-Square Calculator gives a probability of 0.85.  This falls within the “fat region” of the
probability curve, and thus supports the null hypothesis, just as we
expected.  Next, we invite our subject to attempt to influence the random output
of our generator.  How? Hypotheses non
fingo. Let's just presume that by some means: telekinesis,
voodoo, tampering with the apparatus when we weren't
looking—whatever, our subject is able to bias the generator so
that out of every 200 bits there's an average of 101 one bits and 99
zeroes.  This seemingly subtle bias would result in an experiment like
the following.

terribly obvious divergence from the expectation, yet the chi-square
test unambiguously fingers the bias.  A X ² sum of 89.6775 in
an experiment with 33 possible outcomes (32 degrees of freedom)
has a probability of occurring by chance of 0.00000022—about
two in ten million—a highly significant result, worthy of
follow-up experiments and investigation of possible mechanisms which
might explain the deviation from chance.

Tossed coin    Coin flipping , coin tossing , or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands to choose between two alternatives, sometimes to resolve a dispute between two parties. It is a form of sortition which inherently has only two possible and equally likely outcomes .

Coin flipping was known to the Romans as navia aut caput ("ship or head"), as some coins had a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the other. [1] In England, this was referred to as cross and pile . [1] [2] The expression Heads or Tails results from heads and tails being considered complementary body parts.  Process [ edit ]  During a coin toss, the coin is thrown into the air such that it rotates edge-over-edge several times. Either beforehand or when the coin is in the air, an interested party calls "heads" or "tails", indicating which side of the coin that party is choosing. The other party is assigned the opposite side. Depending on custom, the coin may be caught; caught and inverted; or allowed to land on the ground. When the coin comes to rest, the toss is complete and the party who called correctly or was assigned the upper side is declared the winner.  It is possible for a coin to land on its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even on a flat surface it is possible for a coin to land on its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. [3]  Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped. [4]  The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides; it need not be a circulating coin as such. Larger coins tend to be more popular than smaller ones. Some high-profile coin tosses, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Super Bowl, use custom-made ceremonial medallions. [5] [6]  Three-way [ edit ]  Three-way coin flips are also possible, by a different process – this can be done either to choose two out of three, or to choose one out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, either reverse this (the odd coin out is the winner ), or add a regular two-way coin flip between the remaining players as a second step. Note that the three-way flip is 87.5% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, which occurs 1/8 of the time due to the chances being 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.5, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that "heads" or "tails" be called. A famous example of such a three-way coin flip (choose two out of three) is dramatized in Friday Night Lights (originally a book , subsequently film and TV series ), where three high school football teams with identical records use a three-way coin flip – at a truck stop – to determine which two will advance to the playoffs. [7] [8] A legacy of this coin flip was to reduce the use of coin flips to break ties in Texas sports, instead using point-systems to reduce the frequency of ties.  Use in dispute resolution [ edit ]     The coin toss at the start of Super Bowl XLIII    Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.     Navy-Notre Dame coin toss    Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football , volleyball , and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame , and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The XFL , a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style "opening scramble," in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football , in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football.  In an association football match, the team winning the coin toss chooses which goal to attack in the first half; the opposing team kicks off for the first half. For the second half, the teams switch ends, and the team that won the coin toss kicks off. Coin tosses are also used to decide which team has the pick of going first or second in a penalty shoot-out . Before the early-1970s introduction of the penalty shootout , coin tosses were occasionally needed to decide the outcome of tied matches. The most famous instance of this was the semifinal game of the 1968 European Championship in Italy between Italy and the Soviet Union , which finished 0-0 after extra time. Italy won, and went on to become European champions. [9]     Tossing a coin is common in many sports, such as cricket , where it is used to decide which team gets the choice of bowling or batting first. Shown are Don Bradman and Gubby Allen  tossing for innings .    In cricket the toss is often significant, as the decision whether to bat or bowl first can influence the outcome of the game. Similarly, in tennis a coin toss is used in professional matches to determine which player serves first. The player who wins the toss decides whether to serve first or return, while the loser of the toss decides which end of the court each player plays on first.  In duels a coin toss was sometimes used to determine which combatant had the sun at his back. [10] In some other sports, the result of the toss is less crucial and merely a way to fairly choose between two more or less equal options.  The National Football League also has a coin toss for tie-breaking among teams for playoff berths and seeding, but the rules make the need for coin toss, which is random rather than competitive, very unlikely. A similar procedure breaks ties for the purposes of seeding in the NFL Draft ; these coin tosses are more common, since the tie-breaking procedure for the draft is much less elaborate than the one used for playoff seeding.  Major League Baseball once conducted a series of coin flips as a contingency on the last month of its regular season to determine home teams for any potential one-game playoff games that might need to be added to the regular season. Most of these cases did not occur. From the 2009 season , the method to determine home-field advantage was changed. [11]  Fédération Internationale d'Escrime rules use a coin toss to determine the winner of a fencing match that remains tied at the end of a " sudden death " extra minute of competition. Although in most international matches this is now done electronically by the scoring apparatus. [ citation needed ]  In the United States  Asa Lovejoy and Francis W. Pettygrove , who each owned the claim to the land that would later become Portland, Oregon , wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns of Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine ; Pettygrove won the coin flip . [12]  Scientists sometimes use coin flipping to determine the order in which they appear on the list of authors of scholarly papers . [13]  Politics [ edit ]  Australia [ edit ]  In December 2006, Australian television networks Seven and Ten , which shared the broadcasting of the 2007 AFL Season , decided who would broadcast the Grand Final with the toss of a coin. Network Ten won. [ citation needed ]  Canada [ edit ]  In some jurisdictions, a coin is flipped to decide between two candidates who poll equal number of votes in an election , or two companies tendering equal prices for a project. For example, a coin toss decided a City of Toronto tender in 2003 for painting lines on 1,605 km of city streets: the bids were $161,110.00 ($100.3800623 per km), $146,584.65 ($91.33 per km, exactly), and two equal bids of $111,242.55 ($69.31 per km, exactly).  Philippines [ edit ]  " Drawing of lots " is one of the methods to break ties to determine a winner in an election; the coin flip is considered an acceptable variant. Each candidate will be given five chances to flip a coin; the candidate with the most number of "heads" wins. The 2013 mayoral election in San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro was decided on a coin flip, with a winner being proclaimed after the second round when both candidates remained tied in the first round. [14]  United Kingdom [ edit ]  In the United Kingdom, if a local or national election has resulted in a tie where candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, then the winner can be decided either by drawing straws/lots, coin flip, or drawing a high card in pack of cards. [15] [16]  United States [ edit ]  In the United States , a coin toss determines the class of the senators of a state being added to the Union, with the new state's senators due to be entering the US Senate . [17] A number of states provide for "drawing lots" in the event an election ends in a tie - this is usually resolved by a coin toss or picking names from a hat. [18] A 2017 election to the 94th District of the Virginia House of Delegates resulted in both Republican incumbent David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds tied with exactly 11,608 votes. Under state law, the election was to be decided by drawing a name from a bowl, although a coin toss would also have been an acceptable option. The chair of the Board of Elections drew the film canister with Yancey's name, and he was declared the winner. [19] Additionally, the outcome of the draw determined control of the entire House, as Republicans won 50 of the other 99 seats and Democrats 49. A Yancey win extended the Republican advantage to 51-49, whereas a Simmonds win would have resulted in a 50-50 tie. As there is no provision for breaking ties in the House as a whole, this would have forced a power sharing agreement between the two parties. [20]  Physics [ edit ]  The outcome of coin flipping has been studied by Persi Diaconis and his collaborators. They have demonstrated that a mechanical coin flipper which imparts the same initial conditions for every toss has a highly predictable outcome – the phase space is fairly regular. Further, in actual flipping, people exhibit slight bias – "coin tossing is fair to two decimals but not to three. That is, typical flips show biases such as .495 or .503." [21]  In studying coin flipping, to observe the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, so that when the speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time. [21]  Moreover, their theoretical analysis of the physics of coin tosses predicts a slight bias for a caught coin to be caught the same way up as it was thrown, with a probability of around 0.51, [22] though a subsequent attempt to verify this experimentally gave ambiguous results. [23] Stage magicians and gamblers, with practice, are able to greatly increase this bias, whilst still making throws which are visually indistinguishable from normal throws. [21]  Since the images on the two sides of actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to slightly favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing. Coin spinning is much more likely to be biased than flipping, and conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.  Counterintuitive properties [ edit ]  Human intuition about conditional probability is often very poor and can give rise to some seemingly surprising observations. For example, if the successive tosses of a coin are recorded as a string of "H" and "T", then for any trial of tosses, it is twice as likely that the triplet TTH will occur before THT than after it. It is three times as likely that THH will precede HHT, than that THH will follow HHT. [24] (See Penney's game )  Mathematics [ edit ]  The mathematical abstraction of the statistics of coin flipping is described by means of the Bernoulli process ; a single flip of a coin is a Bernoulli trial . In the study of statistics, coin-flipping plays the role of being an introductory example of the complexities of statistics. A commonly treated textbook topic is that of checking if a coin is fair .  Telecommunications [ edit ]  Further information: Commitment scheme  There is no reliable way to use a true coin flip to settle a dispute between two parties if they cannot both see the coin—for example, over the phone. The flipping party could easily lie about the outcome of the toss. In telecommunications and cryptography , the following algorithm can be used:   Alice and Bob each choose a random string, "ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd" and "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" respectively.  Alice chooses an outcome for an imaginary coin flip, such as "tail"  Bob sends Alice his random string "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd"  Alice immediately computes a cryptographic hash of the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd", which is 59dea408d43183a3937957e71a4bcacc616d9cbc and sends it to Bob  Alice asks Bob: "heads or tails"?  Bob says, for instance, "heads".  Alice tells him she's just won, and proves it by showing the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd".  Bob can check that Alice didn't lie by computing the SHA-1 of the string himself  Furthermore, Bob by providing his own randomly generated string guarantees that Alice wasn't able to precompute an image pair of "tail/random string" or "head/random string".   Lotteries [ edit ]  The New Zealand  lottery game Big Wednesday uses a coin toss. If a player matches all 6 of their numbers, the coin toss will decide whether they win a cash jackpot (minimum of NZ$25,000) or a bigger jackpot with luxury prizes (minimum of NZ$2 million cash, plus value of luxury prizes.) The coin toss is also used in determining the Second Chance winner's prize.  Clarifying feelings [ edit ]  A technique attributed to Sigmund Freud to help in making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I want you to do is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." [25]  Danish poet Piet Hein 's book Grooks includes a poem on a similar theme:   A Psychological Tip  Whenever you're called on to make up your mind, And you're hampered by not having any, The best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find, Is simply by spinning a penny. No—not so that chance shall decide the affair While you're passively standing there moping; But the moment the penny is up in the air, You suddenly know what you're hoping.

that we have a well defined repeatable (in principle) experiment,
which has as its outcome a set of well defined, mutually exclusive ,
events.  Examples:  In the experiment of flipping a coin, the mutually
exclusive outcomes are the coin landing either heads up or tails up.  In the experiment of rolling one die, the mutually
exclusive outcomes are the die landing with either the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or
6 face up.  (When we speak of the "probability" that the Buffalo
Bills will win the Super Bowl next year, we are using the word 
"probability"
in its colloquial sense, not its mathematical sense. This is because the
Buffalo Bills winning the Super Bowl in a given year is not a repeatable
experiment.)  2) We assume that in any particular individual trial
of the experiment, the outcome for that individual trial cannot be 
predicted
or known before hand - it is controlled by chance. However, when a very
large number of independent trials of the experiment are performed,
one finds that each possible outcome occurs a well defined fraction of
the time. This fraction is called the probability for that 
particular
outcome to occur. The probability for an outcome is always a number between
0 and 1. If the probability is zero, we say that this outcome can never
occur. If the probability is one, we say that this outcome always occurs
with complete certainty.  Examples:  When we flip a coin a very large number of times,
we find that we get half heads, and half tails. We conclude that the 
probability
to flip a head is 1/2, and the probability to flip a tail is 1/2.  When we role a die a very large number of times,
we find that we get any given face 1/6 of the time. The probability for
the 1 face to appear is therefore 1/6. Similarly the probability for the
2 (3, 4, 5, or 6) face to appear is also 1/6.  What exactly we mean when we say "a very large number
of times" we will come to in a little while (is 10 times "large" enough?
is 100 times?)  3) The probability for a given outcome might be 
calculable
from some underlying assumptions. Or the probability for an outcome can
be determined experimentally by doing many trials.  Example:  When we flip a coin, we assume that there is no major
difference between the two sides, and there is no exacting way we perform
the flip in order to try and influence the outcome. Because of all the
random factors beyond our control that enter the flipping process (force
with which the coin is flipped, motion of the air in the room, position
of our hand when we catch the coin...) we therefore expect a probability
of 1/2 for heads, and 1/2 for tails. Each possible outcome is equally
likely . However, if we did a very large number of trial flips, and
consistently found heads occurring 3/4 of the time, and tails 1/4 of the
time, we would know that our assumption of equally likely outcomes was
false - we are dealing with a loaded coin. Performing the experiment is
the way to test the assumptions!  Let's now see how these ideas work for some more
complicated examples.  1) Consider the experiment of flipping of 4 
coins.  Each coin flip has 2 possible outcomes, so the 
flipping
of 4 coins has 2 x 2 x 2 x 2
= 16 possible outcomes. We can enumerate all possible outcomes as follows,
where H indicates a head, and T a tail:  HHHH      THHH  HHHT      THHT  HHTH      THTH  HHTT      THTT  HTHH      TTHH  HTHT      TTHT  HTTH      TTTH  HTTT       TTTT  If we assume that each individual coin is equally
likely to come up heads or tails, then each of the above 16 outcomes to
4 flips is equally likely. Each occurs a fraction one out of 16 times,
or each has a probability of 1/16.  Alternatively, we could argue that the 1st coin has
probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, the 2nd coin has probability
1/2 to come up heads or tails, and so on for the 3rd and 4th coins, so
that the probability for any one particular sequence of heads and tails
is just (1/2)x(1/2) x (1/2)x(1/2)=(1/16).  Now lets ask: what is the probability that in 4 
flips,
one gets N heads, where N=0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. We can get this just by 
counting
the number of outcomes above which have the desired number of heads, and
dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, 16.    N  # outcomes with
N heads  probability to get N 
heads  0

1/16 = 0.0625  1

1/16 = 0.0625  We can plot these results on a graph as shown 
below.   The dashed line is shown just as a guide to the
eye. Notice that the curve has a "bell" shape. The most likely outcome
is for N=2 heads, where the curve reaches its maximum value. This is just
what you would expect: if each coin is equally likely to land heads as
tails, in four flips, half should come up heads, that is N = 
4 x (1/2)
= 2 is the most likely outcome. Note however that an occurrence of N =
1 or N = 3 is not so unlikely - they occur 1/4 or 25% of the time. To have
an occurrence of only N = 0, or N = 4 (no heads, or all heads) is much
less likely - they occur only 1/16 or 6.25% of the time.  The above procedure is in principle the way to solve
all problems in probability. Define the experiment, enumerate all possible
mutually exclusive outcomes (which are usually assumed to be each equally
likely), and then count the number of these outcomes which have the 
particular
property being tested for (here for example, the number of heads). Dividing
this number by the total number of possible outcomes then gives the 
probability
of the system to have that particular property.  Often, however, the number of possible outcomes may
be so large that an explicit enumeration would become very tedious. In
such cases, one can resort to more subtle thinking to arrive at the desired
probabilities. For example, we can deduce the probabilities to get N heads
in 4 flips as follows:  N=0: There is only one possible outcome that gives
0 heads, namely when each flip results in a tail. The probability is 
therefore
1/16.  N=4: There is only one possible outcome that gives
4 heads, namely when each flip results in a head. The probability is 
therefore
1/16.  N=1: There are 4 possible outcomes which will have
only one coin heads. It may be that the 1st coin is heads, and all others
are tails; or it may be that the 2nd coin is heads, and all others are
tails; or it may be that the 3rd (or the 4th) coin is heads, and all others
are tails. Since there are 4 possible outcomes with one head only, the
probability is 4/16 = 1/4.  N=3: To get 3 heads, means that one gets only one
tail. This tail can be either the 1st coin, the 2nd coin, the 3rd, or the
4th coin. Thus there are only 4 outcomes which have three heads. The 
probability
is 4/16 = 1/4.  N=2: To enumerate directly all the possible outcomes
which have exactly 2 heads only, is a bit trickier than the other cases.
We will come to it shortly. But we can get the desired probability for
N=2 the following way: We have already enumerated all possible outcomes
with either N = 0, 1, 3, or 4 heads. These account for 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 =
10 possible outcomes. The only outcomes not include in these 10 are those
with exactly N=2 heads. Since there are 16 possible outcomes, and 10 do
not have N=2 heads, there must therefore be exactly 16 - 10 = 6 outcomes
which do have exactly N=2 heads. The probability for N=2 is therefore 6/16
= 3/8.  2) Consider the experiment of rolling 3 dice, each
of which has 6 sides.  What is the probability that no two dice land with
the same number side up, i.e. each of the three dice rolls a different
number?  Since each die has 6 possible outcomes, the number
of possible outcomes for the roll of three dice is 6x6x6 = 216. We could
enumerate all these 216 possibilities, and then count the number of 
outcomes
in which each die has a different number. This is clearly too tedious!
Instead we reason as follows:  When the 1st die is rolled, it can land with anyone
of its 6 faces up. When the 2nd die is rolled, there are only 5 possible
sides which will be consistent with our criterion that no two die land
the same. When the 3rd die is rolled, it must land with a face different
from die one and two; there are 4 possibilities. Therefore the total number
of outcomes which have each of the three dice with a different side up
is 6x5 x 4 = 120.  The probability for this to happen is then 120/216
= 5/9 = .55555...  Alternatively, we can say that the probability for
the 1st die to land with any side up is 1, the probability for the 2nd
die to land with a side different from the 1st die is 5/6, and the 
probability
for the 3rd die to land with a side different from both the 1st and the
2nd die is 4/6. The probability that each of the three dice has a different
side up is then (1) x (5/6) x (4/6)
= 20/36 = 5/9.  We learn from the above examples three general rules
about probabilities:  1) The probability than any one of a given group
of mutually exclusive possible outcomes will actually occur in a given
experiment, is the sum of the individual probabilities for each outcome
in the group.  Example:  In counting the number of heads in 4 coin flips,
the probability that we get exactly one head is the probability that we
get anyone of the following 4 outcomes: HTTT, THTT, TTHT, or TTTH. Each
has probability 1/16, so the probability to get exactly one head in 4 flips
is 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.  A consequence of this fact is that the sum of the 
probabilities
for all the possible outcomes must equal 1. This is just saying that the
probability that the experiment yields some outcome (we don't care which
outcome) is just unity, i.e.. it is certain to happen!  2) The probability for two independent events to
both occur is just the product of the probabilities for each individual
event.  Example:  The probability for no heads to occur in four flips
was (1/2) x (1/2) x (1/2)x(1/2)
= 1/16.  3) The probability for two events to both occur, even
if they are not independent, is the probability for the first to occur,
times the probability for the second to occur given the condition that
the first has already occurred.  Example:  The probability that the second die lands with
a different face than the first is the probability that the 1st lands with
any face times the probability that the second lands with a different face,
1x(5/6)=5/6. The probability that the 3rd die lands with yet a different
face is 5/6 times the probability that the 3rd die lands with one of the
4 other faces, (5/6) x (4/6) = 20/36 = 
5/9.  Some more examples:  1) If we roll 4 dice, what is the probability that
at least one of them lands with the "6" face on top?  Since each dice can land 6 ways, and there are 4
dice, there are 6 x 6 x 6x6
= 6 4 = 1,296 different possible outcomes. We could
in principle write these all down and then count the number which have
at least one "6", but this is way too tedious. Instead, lets count the
number of outcomes which do not have any "6"s showing. To have no
"6" showing, the first dice can land in any one of 5 possible ways. 
Similarly
for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th die. Thus the number of outcomes with no "6"
showing on any die is 5 x 5 x 5x5
= 5 4 = 625. Since we must either see no "6"s, or else
we see at least one "6", it follows that the number of outcomes with at
least one "6" must be the (total number of outcomes) - (number of outcomes
with no "6") = 1,296 - 625 = 671. The probability to have at least one
"6" is therefore 671/1296 = 0.5177469...  We could also have arranged our calculation as 
follows:      Written this way, we see that (5/6) is the 
probability
that any give die lands without a "6" on top. 
(5/6)x(5/6)x(5/6) x (5/6)
is therefore (general rule #2) the probability that all 4 dice land without
a "6" on top. Since the probability of all possible outcomes must sum to
unity (general rule #1), we therefore conclude that 1 - 
(5/6)x(5/6)x(5/6) x (5/6)
is the probability that the opposite of "all 4 dice land without a "6"
on top" happens. But the opposite of "all 4 dice land without a "6" on
top" is that "at least one die lands with a "6" on top"!  In this example we see that we can divide all our
possible outcomes into two classes. One class which has the desired 
property
we are testing for (in this case, at least one "6" on top), and a second
class which does not have the desired property (no dice has a "6" on top).
Often it turns out to be hard to directly calculate the probability for
the desired property, but easy to calculate the probability not to find the desired property. The first probability is then just unity
minus the second probability.  2) What is the probability that in a group of N 
people,
we will find at least 2 people with the same birthday? For the purpose
of this question, we will consider people born on February 29 as if they
were born on February 28!  This is equal to 1 - (probability no 2 people have
same birthday)  Probability that no 2 people have the same birthday
is:  =  since the first person can have any birthday, the
second person can have only one of the remaining 364 out of 365 possible
birthdays (i.e. not the same as the first), the third person can have only
one of the remaining 363 out 365 possible birthdays (i.e. not the same
as either the first or the second), and so on, down to the last Nth person.
So the probability that at least 2 people in a group of N have the
same birthday is:  p(N) = 1 -  We can plot p(N) versus N on a graph, as shown 
below.   Note that for N=10, p(10)=0.11695, or about 12% 
chance
to have two people with the same birthday. For N=50, p(50)=0.97037, or
97% chance to have two people with the same birthday. These probabilities
are in general much larger than most people's intuition would have 
guessed.    Examples from Text:  1) Two fair dice are rolled. What is the probability
p that at least one die come up a 3?  We can do this two ways:  i) The straightforward way is as follows. To get
at least one 3, would be consistent with the following three mutually 
exclusive
outcomes:  the 1st die is a 3 and the 2nd is not: prob = 
(1/6)x(5/6)=5/36  the 1st die is not a 3 and the 2nd is: prob = 
(5/6)x((1/6)=5/36  both the 1st and 2nd come up 3: prob = 
(1/6)x(1/6)=1/36  sum of the above three cases is prob for at least
one 3, p = 11/36  ii) A faster way is as follows: prob at least one
3 = 1 - (prob no 3's)  The probability to get no 3's is (5/6)x(5/6) = 
25/36.  So the probability to get at least one 3 is, p =
1 - (25/36) = 11/36  2) What is the probability that a card drawn at 
random
from an ordinary 52 deck of playing cards is a queen or a heart?  There are 4 queens and 13 hearts, so the probability
to draw a queen is  4/52 and the probability to draw a heart is 13/52.
But the probability to draw a queen or a heart is NOT the sum 4/52 + 13/52.
This is because drawing a queen and drawing a heart are not mutually 
exclusive
outcomes - the queen of hearts can meet both criteria! The number of cards
which meet the criteria of being either a queen or a heart is only 16 -
the 4 queens and the 12 remaining hearts which are not a queen. So the
probability to draw a queen or a heart is 16/52 = 4/13.  3) Five coins are tossed. What is the probability
that the number of heads exceeds the number of tails?  We can divide all possible outcomes into the 
following
two mutually exclusive groups:  i) the number of heads flipped is more than the 
number
of tails flipped  ii) the number of tails flipped is more than the
number of heads flipped  Since the probability to flip a head is the same
as the probability to flip a tail, the probability of outcome (i) must
be equal to the probability of outcome (ii). So both must be equal to 
1/2.  Note that this answer works for any odd number of
coin flips.  4) 4 boys and 3 girls are standing in a line. If
the position of each child in line is random, what is the probability that
the first 3 places in line are all girls?  We will solve this problem two ways:  i) Lets us count the number of all the possible 
orderings
of the 7 children which are consistent with the desired outcome (i.e. 3
girls in front) and divide by the total number of all possible 
orderings.  The total number of orderings is: 7x6x5 x 4x3x2 x 1  as there are 7 children to pick to be 1st in line,
only 6 remaining children to pick to be 2nd in line, then only 5 remaining
children to pick to be 3rd in line, and so on.  The number of orderings consistent with 3 girls in
front is: (3 x 2 x 1)x(4x3 x 2x1)  as there are 3 girls to pick to be 1st in line, 2
remaining girls to pick to be 2nd in line, and the last girl must go 3rd
in line; then there are 4 boys to place 4th in line, 3 remaining boys to
place 5th in line, and so on.  So the probability to get all 3 girls in front 
is  ii) Alternatively, we can argue as follows. The 
probability
that a girl is 1st in line is (3/7) since 3 of the 7 children are girls.
The probability that a girl is 2nd in line, given that the 1st is a girl,
is (2/6) since 2 of the remaining 6 children are girls. The probability
that a girl is 3rd in line, given that the 1st and 2nd are girls, is (1/5)
since now only 1 of the remaining 5 children is a girl. So the probability
that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions are all girls is  (3/7) x (2/6)x(1/5)=1/35                                                                     Accessibility Navigation  Primary Navigation  Content      Toggle  Share   Search  Search Close    Search    Search        SUBSCRIBE (Left)    RENEW (Left)    GIVE A GIFT (Left)         Smithsonian    Subscribe (Mobile)      Facebook    Instagram    Pinterest    Twitter    Google+    Newsletter      Search  Search  Search    Search            SmartNews     History    Science    Innovation    Arts & Culture    Travel         Featured: Adélie Penguin Super-Colony Found       History     Archaeology    U.S. History    World History    Video    Newsletter         Featured: The Packhorse Librarians of the Great Depression       Science     Age of Humans    Human Behavior    Mind & Body    Our Planet    Space    Wildlife    Newsletter    Earth Optimism Summit         Featured: Life in the Cosmos       Innovation     Education    Energy    Health & Medicine    Technology    Video    Newsletter    Ingenuity Awards         Featured: Nine Innovators to Watch in 2018       Arts & Culture     Art    Books    Design    Food    Music & Film    Video    Newsletter         Featured: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking       Travel     Armenia    Austria    Norway    Taiwan    Family Travel    Travel With Us    Newsletter         Featured: Ten Major 2018 Anniversaries Worth Traveling For       At the Smithsonian     Visit    Exhibitions    New Research    Artifacts    Curators' Corner    Ask Smithsonian    Podcasts    Lodging    Newsletter    Voices         Featured: Sidedoor: A Smithsonian Podcast       Photos     Submit to Our 2018 Contest    2017 Photo Contest Winners Announced    Photo of the Day    Tumblr    Instagram       Videos & Podcasts     Ingenuity Awards    Ask Smithsonian    Smithsonian Channel    Video Contest    Podcasts       Games     Daily Sudoku    Universal Crossword    Daily Word Search    Jumble    Mah Jong Quest    KenKen    Backgammon       Subscribe (Top Menu)    Current Issue     Subscribe  Save 84% off the newsstand price!

Flipping a coin isn't as fair as it seems. (Courtesy of flickr user MagnuMicah )    By Dan Lewis    smithsonian.com   November 30, 2012         Posted from Dan Lewis' fantastic Now I Know newsletter. Subscribe here or follow him on Twitter .    Imagine you’re at a bar and another patron offers you the following wager. He’s going to flip a coin — a standard U.S. penny like the ones seen above — a dozen or so times. If it comes up heads more often than tails, he’ll pay you $20. If it comes up tails more than heads, you pay him the same. There are no hidden tricks. It’s a fair bet — safe to take, if you’re looking for a 50/50 chance.  Now, imagine the same offer, except that instead of flipping the coin, the other patron tells you he’s going to spin it. In fact, he’ll even let you provide the penny, just to guarantee there is no funny business. Twenty-five spins and if it comes up heads more often than tails, he’ll give you $20 again. But if tails comes up more often, you owe him $20.  Fair bet? Not if Persi Diaconis is right.  Diaconis is a professor of mathematics and statistics at Stanford University and, formerly, a professional magician. While his claim to fame is determining how many times a deck of cards must be shuffled in order to give a mathematically random result (it’s either five or seven, depending on your criteria), he’s also dabbled in the world of coin games. What he and his fellow researchers discovered ( here’s a PDF of their paper ) is that most games of chance involving coins aren’t as even as you’d think. For example, even the 50/50 coin toss really isn’t 50/50 — it’s closer to 51/49, biased toward whatever side was up when the coin was thrown into the air.  But more incredibly, as reported by Science News , spinning a penny, in this case one with the Lincoln Memorial on the back, gives even more pronounced odds — the penny will land tails side up roughly 80 percent of the time. The reason: the side with Lincoln’s head on it is a bit heavier than the flip side, causing the coin’s center of mass to lie slightly toward heads. The spinning coin tends to fall toward the heavier side more often, leading to a pronounced number of extra “tails” results when it finally comes to rest.  Because the coins typically pick up dirt and oils over time, trying the experiment at home may not yield such a large percentage of “tails” over “heads” — but a relatively new coin should still give you noticeable results.

Game Theory (Part 9)  John Baez  Last time we talked about independence of a pair of outcomes, but we can easily go on and talk about independence of a longer sequence of outcomes.  For example, suppose we have three coins.   Suppose:   the 1st coin has probability \( p_H\) of landing heads up and \( p_T\) of landing tails up;  the 2nd coin has probability \( q_H\) of landing heads up and \( q_T\) of landing tails up;  the 3rd coin has probability \( r_H\) of landing heads up and \( r_T\) of landing tails up.   Suppose we flip all of these coins: the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  What's the probability that we get this sequence of results: \( (H, T, T)\) If the coin flips are independent , the probability is just this product: \( p_H \, q_T \, r_T \) See the pattern?  We just multiply the probabilities.  And there's nothing special about coins here, or the number three . We could flip a coin, roll a die, pick a card, and see if it's raining outside. For example, what's the probability that we get heads with our coin, the number 6 on our die, an ace of spades with our cards, and it's raining? If these outcomes are independent , we just calculate: the probability that we get heads, times
the probability that we roll a 6, times
the probability that we get an ace of spades, times
the probability that it's raining outside. Let's solve some puzzles using this idea! Three flips of a fair coin Example 1. Suppose you have a fair coin: this means it has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up.  Suppose you flip it three times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up, then tails up, then heads up? We're asking about the probability of this outcome: \( (H, T, H)\) Since the flips are independent this is \( p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H \, p_T \, p_H \) Since the coin is fair we have \( \displaystyle{ p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2} } \) so \(  \displaystyle{ p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} } \) So the answer is 1/8, or 12.5%. Example 2. In the same situation, what's the probability that the coin lands heads up exactly twice? There are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 outcomes that can happen: \( (H,H,H) \)
\( (H,H,T), \; (H,T,H), \; (T,H,H) \)
\( (H,T,T), \; (T,H,T), \; (T,T,H) \)
\( (T,T,T) \) We can work out the probability of each of these outcomes.  For example, we've already seen that \( (H,T,H)\) is \( \displaystyle{ p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{8} }\) since the coin is fair and the flips are independent.  In fact, all 8 probabilities work out the same way.  We always get 1/8.  In other words, each of the 8 outcomes is equally likely! But we're interested in the probability that we get exactly two heads.  That's the probability of this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) Using the rule we saw in Part 7 , this probability is \( \displaystyle{ p(S) = p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) So the answer is 3/8, or 37.5%. I could have done this a lot faster.  I could say "there are 8 outcomes that can happen, each equally likely, and three that give us two heads, so the probability is 3/8."   But I wanted to show you how we're just following rules we've already seen! Three flips of a very unfair coin Example 3. Now suppose we have an unfair coin with a 90% chance of landing heads up and 10% chance of landing tails up!  What's the probability that if we flip it three times, it lands heads up exactly twice?  Again let's assume the coin flips are independent. Most of the calculation works exactly the same way, but now our coin has \( \displaystyle{ p_H = 0.9, \quad p_T = 0.1 } \) We're interested in the outcomes where the coin comes up heads twice, so we look at this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) The probability of this subset is \( \begin{array}{ccl} p(S) &=& p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} \\  &=& p_T \, p_H  \, p_H + p_H \, p_T \, p_H + p_H \, p_H \, p_T \\ &=& 3 p_T p_H^2 \\ &=& 3 \times 0.1 \times 0.9^2 \\ &=& 0.3 \times 0.81 \\ &=& 0.243 \end{array}\) So now the probability is just 24.3%. Six flips of a fair coin Example 4. Suppose you have a fair coin.  Suppose you flip it six times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up exactly twice? We did a similar problem already, where we flipped the coin three times.  Go back and look at that if you forget!  The answer to that problem was \( \displaystyle{ 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) Why?  Here's why: there were 3 ways to get two heads when you flipped 3 coins, and each of these outcomes had probability \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} }\) We can do our new problem the same way.  Count the number of ways to get two heads when we flip six coins.  Then multiply this by \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} }\) The hard part is to count how many ways we can get two heads when we flip six coins.  To get good at probabilities, we have to get good at counting.  It's boring to list all the outcomes we're trying to count: (H,H,T,T,T,T), (H,T,H,T,T,T), (H,T,T,H,T,T), ... So let's try to come up with a better idea. We have to pick 2 out of our 6 flips to be H's.  How many ways are there to do this? There are 6 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, and then 5 ways left over to pick another and draw a blue H on it... letting the rest be T's.  For example: (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, we've got 6 × 5 = 30 choices.  But we don't really care which H is red and which H is blue—that's just a trick to help us solve the problem.  For example, we don't want to count (T, H , T, T, H , T) as different from (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, there aren't really 30 ways to get two heads.  There are only half as many!  There are 15 ways. So, the probability of getting two heads when we flip the coin six times is \( \displaystyle{ 15 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{15}{64} \approx .234 } \) where the squiggle means 'approximately'.  So: about 23.4%. Binomial coefficients Now for some jargon, which will help when we do harder problems like this.  We say there are 6 choose 2 ways to choose 2 out of 6 things, and we write this as \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2} } \) This sort of number is called a binomial coefficient . We've just shown that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2}  = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 }\) Why write it like this funky fraction: \( \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}\)?  Because it'll help us see the pattern for doing harder problems like this! Nine flips of a fair coin If we flip a fair coin 9 times, and the flips are independent, what's the probability that we get heads exactly 6 times? This works just like the last problem, only the numbers are bigger.  So, I'll do it faster! When we flip the coin 9 times there are \( 2^9\) possible outcomes that can happen.   Each of these is equally likely if it's a fair coin and the flips are independent.  So each has probability \( \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{2^9} } \) To get the answer, we need to multiply this by the number of ways we can get heads exactly 6 times.  This number is called '9 choose 6' or \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6}  }\) for short.  It's the number of ways we can choose 6 things out of a collection of 9. So we just need to know: what's 9 choose 6?  We can work this out as before.  There are 9 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, then 8 ways left to pick another and draw a blue H on it, and 7 ways left to pick a third and draw a orange H on it.  That sounds like 9 × 8 × 7. But we've overcounted!   After all, we don't care about the colors.  We don't care about the difference between this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) and this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) In fact we've counted each possibility 6 times!  Why six?   The first H could be red, green or blue — that's 3 choices.  But then the second H could be either of the two remaining 2 colors... and for the third, we just have 1 choice.  So there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to permute the colors. So, the actual number of ways to get 6 heads out of 9 coin flips is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) In other words: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) To get the answer to our actual problem, remember we need to multiply \( 1/2^9\) by this.  So the answer is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6} }\) If you're a pure mathematician, you can say you're done now.  But normal people won't understand this answer, so let's calculate it out.  I hope you know the first ten powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.  So: \( \displaystyle{ 2^9 = 512 }\) I hope you can also do basic arithmetic like this: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84} \) So, the probability of getting 6 heads when you do 9 independent flips of a fair coin is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6}  = \frac{84}{512} = 0.164025 } \) or 16.4025%. I broke down and used a calculator at the last step.   We're becoming serious nerds here. Okay, that's enough for now.  We've been counting how many ways we can get a certain number of heads from a certain number of coin flips.  What we're realy doing is taking a set of coin flips, say \( n\) of them, and choosing a subset of \( k\) of them to be heads.  So, we say Definition. The binomial coefficient  \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} } \) called \( n\) choose \( k,\) is the number of ways of choosing a subset of \( k\) things from a set of \( n\) things. We have seen in some examples that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1} } \) Here there's a product of \( k\) consecutive numbers on top, and \( k\) on bottom too.  We didn't prove this is true in general, but it's not hard to see, using the tricks we've used already.

When asked the question, what is the probability of a coin toss coming up heads, most people answer without hesitation
that it is 50%, 1/2, or 0.5                      we get this probability by assuming that the coin is fair, or heads and tails are equally likely The probability for equally likely outcomes is:  Number of outcomes in the event ÷ Total number of possible outcomes  For the coin, number of outcomes to get heads  = 1 Total number of possible outcomes = 2 Thus, we get 1/2 However, if you suspect that the coin may not be fair, you can toss the coin  a large number of times and 
count the number of heads Suppose you flip the coin 100 and get 60 heads, then you know the best estimate to get head is 60/100 = 0.6 This way of looking at probability is called the relative frequency estimate of a probability The interesting thing with this is that the more you flip the coin, the closer you get to 0.5 If you have a computer, you can simulate coin toss probability with different numbers of coin tosses, the result might be a table like this.     Number of tosses    Number of heads    Probability to get heads     4  1  0.25    100  56  0.56    1000  510  0.510    10000  4988  0.4988     Notice that for 10000 flip, the probability is close to 0.5 Try the same experiment to get the coin toss probability with the following coin flip simulation. After you have flipped the coin so many times, you should get answers close to 0.5 for both heads and tails                                      Homepage Algebra lessons Understanding probability Coin toss probability               Recent Articles                                 What is an exponential function  Apr 09, 18 06:04 PM Definition of exponential function and some examples of functions that are exponential functions  Read More    New math lessons        Email    First Name (optional)    Subscribe     Your email is safe with us.

You do $n = 10$ trials. The probability of one successful trial is $p = \frac{1}{2}$. You want $k = 3$ successes and $n - k = 7$ failures. The probability is:  $$
\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \binom{10}{3} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{3} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{7} = \dfrac{15}{128}
$$  One way to understand this formula: You want $k$ successes (probability: $p^k$) and $n-k$ failures (probability: $(1-p)^{n-k}$). The successes can occur anywhere in the trials, and there are $\binom{n}{k}$ to arrange $k$ successes in $n$ trials.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 30 '12 at 22:51             answered May 30 '12 at 22:45       Ayman Hourieh   29.9k 4 58 107                  I am bit confused about this.

Since the positive outcomes are equally likely, it's simply adding them all up. – user190080  Nov 14 '17 at 15:02        add a comment |             up vote  22  down vote      We build a mathematical model of the experiment.  Write H for head and T for tail.  Record the results of the tosses as a string of length $10$, made up of the letters H and/or T.  So for example the string HHHTTHHTHT means that we got a head, then a head, then a head, then a tail, and so on.  There are $2^{10}$ such strings of length $10$.  This is because we have $2$ choices for the first letter, and for every such choice we have $2$ choices for the second letter, and for every choice of the first two letters, we have $2$ choices for the third letter, and so on.  Because we assume that the coin is fair, and that the result we get on say the first $6$ tosses does not affect the probability of getting a head on the $7$-th toss, each of these $2^{10}$ ($1024$) strings is equally likely . Since the probabilities must add up to $1$, each string has probability $\frac{1}{2^{10}}$.
So for example the outcome HHHHHHHHHH is just as likely as the outcome HTTHHTHTHT. This may have an intuitively implausible feel, but it fits in very well with experiments.  Now let us assume that we will be happy only if we get exactly $3$ heads.  To find the probability we will be happy, we count the number of strings that will make us happy. Suppose there are $k$ such strings. Then the probability we will be happy is $\frac{k}{2^{10}}$.  Now we need to find $k$. So we need to count the number of strings that have exactly $3$ H's.  To do this, we find the number of ways to choose  where the H's will occur. So we must choose $3$ places (from the $10$ available) for the H's to be.  We can choose $3$ objects from $10$ in $\binom{10}{3}$ ways. This number is called also by various other names, such as $C_3^{10}$, or ${}_{10}C_3$, or $C(10,3)$, and there are other names too. It is called a binomial coefficient , because it is the coefficient of $x^3$ when the expression $(1+x)^{10}$ is expanded.  There is a useful formula for the binomial coefficients. In general
$$\binom{n}{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.$$  In particular, $\binom{10}{3}=\frac{10!}{3!7!}$. This turns out to be $120$. So the probability of exactly $3$ heads in $10$ tosses is
$\frac{120}{1024}$.  Remark: The idea can be substantially generalized. If we toss a coin $n$ times, and the probability of a head on any toss is $p$ (which need not be equal to $1/2$, the coin could be unfair), then the probability of exactly $k$ heads is
$$\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}.$$
This probability model is called the Binomial distribution . It is of great practical importance, since it underlies all simple yes/no polling.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 31 '12 at 0:18             answered May 30 '12 at 23:01       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |             up vote  16  down vote      You are looking for  $$\frac{\text{Number of Relevant Outcomes}}{\text{Number ofTotal Outcomes}}.$$  The number of total outcomes is $2^{10}$.

Then you have to arrange 3 heads and 7 tails within 10 open slots.
We can name our Heads: $H(A)$, $H(B)$, and $H(C)$. Now, you can arrange the heads in such ways that $H(A)$ will essentially have 10 open slots, $H(B)$ will have 9 open slots and $H(C)$ will have 8 open slots. In other words there are: $$10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720$$ ways to arrange these heads. However, this accounts for the fact that all heads are different. Therefore the number of positions in which $H(x)$ can be arranged in is $$3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6,$$ and so there are: $$\frac{720}{6} = 120 $$
scenarios of which 3 heads and 7 tails are given. Therefore

If the coin is flipped two times what is the probability of getting a head in either of those attempts?  I think both the coin flips are mutually exclusive events, so the probability would be getting head in attempt 1 or attempt 2 which is :  P(attempt1) + P(attempt2) =  1/2 + 1/2 = 1  100% probability sounds wrong? What am I doing wrong. If i apply the same logic then probability of getting at least 1 head in 3 attempt will be 1/2+1/2+1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 which I know for sure is wrong.

"Mutually exclusive" simply means that the two events cannot happen together.  If A happens then B does not and if B happens A does not.  "Independent" simply means that the occurrence of one event is not conditional on the occurrence of the other.  The probability of A happening does not depend on whether B happens or not, and vice versa.   Let $H_n$ be the indexed event of getting a head on the $n^{th}$ flip.  Given an unbiased coin, $P(H_1)=P(H_2)=\frac 1 2$  These events are independent so $P(H_1 \cap H_2) = P(H_1)\times P(H_2)$.  The outcome of one coin toss does not influence the outcome of the other.  However they are not  mutually exclusive , so $P(H_1 \cup H_2) = P(H_1)+P(H_2) - P(H_1 \cap H_2)$.  Both coins can turn up heads.  Putting it together: $$\therefore P(H_1 \cup H_2) = \frac 12 + \frac 1 2 - \frac 12 \times \frac 12 = \frac 3 4$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 22 at 14:08       Alex Johnson   32 7        answered Mar 28 '14 at 9:56       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              1      So if I flip a coin 2 times, there is a 75% chance that I will get heads on at least one of the 2 flips? – Juan Velez  Aug 25 '15 at 16:47        3      @JuanVelez Yes, if there is no bias (ie: fair coins). $\boxed{\begin{array}{c|cc} ~& H & T \\ \hline H & HH & HT \\ T & TH & TT\end{array}}$ Four equally probable results, three of which are the favoured outcome. – Graham Kemp  Aug 25 '15 at 22:52         1      Would it follow, that in 3 tries you'd have an 87.5% chance of success? – Lonnie Best  Dec 20 '15 at 23:15        2      @LonnieBest Yes, it does indeed follow that the change of at least one success in three flips is $1-0.5^3$. – Graham Kemp  Dec 21 '15 at 0:29        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Let $A$ be the event of getting a tail in both tosses, then $A'$ be the event of getting a head in either tosses.

For example, the sequence $$HHTHHHTTTHHHHTHT\dots TTHHHHHTHTHHTTHHHH$$ would be marked $${HHTHHHTTTHH}^{\color{red}|\!}{HHTHT\dots TTHHHHHTHTHHTTHH}^{\color{red}|\!}{HH}^{}.$$  Among the $97$ positions where marks could occur (from after the first two flips to before the final two), a mark does appear in each of the $2^{\rm nd}$ through $96^{\rm th}$ ($95$ in all) of those spots (as $THH^{\color{red}|\!}HHT$) with probability $\frac{1}{2^6}$ (the chance the surrounding sequence of six flips is $THHHHT$). In the first and last positions, the probability is $\frac{1}{2^5}$ (the chance of $HH^{\color{red}|\!}HHT$ for position $1$ and $THH^{\color{red}|\!}HH$ for position $97$).  By the linearity of expectation, the expected number of marks is $95\cdot\frac1{2^6}+2\cdot\frac1{2^5}=\frac{99}{64}$.  [Added] It may be easier to focus on the $H$’s and $T$’s instead of the spaces between them, so another way to mark the runs-of-$4$ is to color in red the last $H$ of each run, like $$HHTHHHTTTHHH\color{red}HTHT\dots TTHHHHHTHTHHTTHHH\color{red}H.$$ The first three $H$’s are colored red with probability $0$, the fourth with probability $\frac{1}{2^5}$, the next $95$ with probability $\frac{1}{2^6}$, and the last with probability $\frac{1}{2^5}$, giving the same result.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 24 '16 at 18:38             answered Jul 24 '16 at 18:28       Steve Kass   8,451 12 23                  Is it possible for you to let me know what the answer would be for 8 out of 100? – Triumph  Jul 27 '16 at 1:48            Try to modify my answer for runs of $8$.

We want the expectation of $X_1+\cdots+X_{97}$. By the linearity of expectation, this is $E(X_1)+\cdots+E(X_{97})$.  So we need only calculate the $\Pr(X_i)=1$.  These are not all equal. If $i=1$ or $i=97$, we have $\Pr(X_i=1)=\frac{1}{32}$. For all the other $i$, we have $\Pr(X_i=1)=\frac{1}{64}$. That is because in all but "end" cases, the string of $4$ H must be flanked by T on both sides.  The required expectation is therefore $2\cdot \frac{1}{32}+95\cdot\frac{1}{64}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 24 '16 at 18:06             answered Jul 24 '16 at 18:00       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  Would this factor in the possibility of 10 heads in a row that would change you 100 coin flips into 90.

Assuming that either team has a 50% chance of winning each of the remaining games, what is the probability of the Heat winning 4 of the remaining games?   There are $6$ remaining games.  The desired criteria is that Heat wins at least $4$, when given that Heat lost the first 1.  This is a binomial distribution ; so named because of the use of the binomial coefficient to count number of permutations of outcomes that match the desired criteria.  The probability of exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials with probability $p$ of success in any trial, is: $${n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \;=\; \,^n\mathrm{\large C}_k\;p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \;=\; \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$  So: $\mathbb{\large P}(\text{win at least }4\text{ more of }6) = {6\choose 4}\left(\frac 12\right)^4\left(\frac 12\right)^2+{6\choose 5}\left(\frac 12\right)^5\left(\frac 12\right)^1+{6\choose 6}\left(\frac 12\right)^6\left(\frac 12\right)^0$.
$$\therefore \mathbb{\large P}(\text{win at least }5\text{ more of }6) = \frac 1{2^6}\left(\frac{6!}{4!2!}+\frac{6!}{5!1!}+\frac{6!}{6!0!}\right)$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '14 at 23:03             answered May 19 '14 at 1:38       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66                  = 42/64, or .65625 (Actually, the Pacers have won the first game, not the Heat.

It's given by:  $$\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$  Where $!$ denotes the factorial ($n!=n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdot ...\cdot 2\cdot1$), $n$ is the 'number of things', and $k$ is 'how many things are chosen'.  So in this specific case, $n=6, k=4$. That gives us the number of ways we can get 4 heads from 6 flips.  You can probably see how to extend this to your sports example, and lose the restriction that they're odds are only as good as a coin-flip.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '14 at 1:12       OJFord   312 1 2 15                  Thanks very much. I get 11/32 as the answer to my coin flipping question. However, I don't understand why I should "lose the restriction that the odds are only as good as a coin-flip" for these NBA games. Or if I did put the probability of the Heat winning each remaining game at .55, how would I calculate the probability of the Heat winning the series? – NotSuper  May 19 '14 at 1:47            Okay, so when you do $P(Win)=\frac{N_{WINS}}{N_{TOTAL}}$, you're implicitly doing $P(Win)=\frac{N_{WINS}}{N_{TOTAL}}\cdot\frac{P(WinGame)}{P(LoseGame)}$. Of course, $P(LoseGame)=1-P(WinGame)$. If you set the odds at 50/50, then you're just multiplying by 1, so you left it out. – OJFord  May 19 '14 at 1:54             Just to make sure that I understand you: P(Win) is the probability of the Heat winning the series, and P(Win) = (22/64)x(.55/.45) = .420. Is this correct? – NotSuper  May 19 '14 at 2:09            Yep.

To explain this:  Flip a coin $3$ times. What is the probability of getting at least $2$ heads?  MANUALLY :
We have (HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTT) $\Rightarrow 8$ cases.
here at least $2$ heads samples are: (HHH, HHT, HTH, THH) $\Rightarrow 4$ cases. So the probability is $4/8 = 1/2$.  WITH MY WAY:
$$\frac{1}{2^3} \left( \frac{3!}{(3-2)!2!} +\frac{3!}{(3-3)! 3!}\right) = \frac{3+1}{8} = \frac 12$$  In the same way it is going to work for the asked one. That's how we get $21/64$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 3 '15 at 13:30       John Ma   36.5k 9 35 67        answered Jul 3 '15 at 10:34       Chandramouli   17 2                  Could you be nice and explicit your way ? – Claude Leibovici  Jul 3 '15 at 11:03        add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      $$\frac{

We will put together atoms that consist of $0$ to $6$ heads followed by a tail.  Any arrangement of heads and tails without $7$ heads in a row, appended with a tail, can be uniquely made up of a number of such atoms.  All arrangements of such atoms appear once somewhere in the sum
$$
\sum_{k=0}^\infty(x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6+x^7)^k
$$
where $x$ represents $T$ $x^2$ represents $HT$ $x^3$ represents $HHT$ $\vdots$ $x^7$ represents $HHHHHHT$  For example, if we are looking for $HTTHHTTH$, append a $T$ and we get the term for $k=5$ where in the first factor, the $x^2$ ($HT$) was chosen, in the second factor, the $x$ ($T$) was chosen, then $x^3$ ($HHT$), then $x$ ($T$), then $x^2$ (HT), to get $HTTHHTTHT$. Note that the exponent of $x$ matches the number of tosses. To count the number of sequences of $40$ flips that do not contain $7$ consecutive heads, we look at the coefficient of $x^{41}$ in
$$
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=0}^\infty(x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6+x^7)^k
&=\frac1{1-x\frac{x^7-1}{x-1}}\\
&=\frac{1-x}{1-2x+x^8}
\end{align}
$$
The coefficient of $x^{41}$ is $955427104501$. There is a degree $8$ recursion to compute this without dividing polynomials: $c_n=2c_{n-1}-c_{n-8}$, where $c_n$ starts
$$
1,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,\dots
$$  The number of sequences of $40$ flips is $2^{40}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sequence of $7$ heads in a row in $40$ flips is
$$
1-\frac{955427104501}{2^{40}}=0.131044110526

If I flip a coin 1,000,000 times, what are the odds of it beings heads AND tails 500,000 times?  ( self.askscience ) submitted 2 years ago by Moore1994 So I was playing around on Excel, and I copied the formula =randbetween(1,2) into 1,000,000 cells. I then summed the total number of 1's and total number of 2's and found the difference.  I refreshed the formulae and the 2nd time the difference was 0, meaning there were exactly 500,000 1s and 500,000 2s. I then carried on refreshing the formula and the difference didn't come out at 0 for quite a while, but was always between -2,500 and +2,500.  This got me thinking - is there a probability of this difference being exactly 0? How would it be possible to work it out, and is there a name for this kind of probability?   731 comments share save hide report top 200 comments show 500 sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

HHTT is as likely as HTHT or TTHH.  So to compute the probability of landing 500,000 heads in 1,000,000 trials, you have to calculate the probability of obtaining 1 particular sequence with this outcome and then multiply it be the number of different sequences with the same outcome.  The sequence of first landing 500,000 heads and then 500,000 tails is such a sequence. The odds of getting it are 0.5 500,000 * (1 - 0.5) 500,000 = 0.5 1,000,000  The number of sequences of 1 milion flips with exactly 500,000 heads is given by the so-called binomial coefficient , which in this case evaluates to 1000,000! / (500,000! * 500,000!) and which is an enormous number (unsurprisingly). (The "!" symbol denotes the factorial which is the product of all numbers less than or equal to the given number, so 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24)  Regular calculators can handle neither the extremely low probability of a single sequence or the very large number of possible sequences with the same outcome. So we go to Wolfram Alpha: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.5%5E1000000+*+Combinations%281000000%2C500000%29  The result: about 0.08%  Note that the above also holds for situations where the outcome of an individual trial is not a 50-50 split between two options. It can also be used for things like calculating the chance of throwing exactly 100 6's in 600 dice rolls (spoiler alert: it's 4.37%)  The general formula to compute the chance of M successes happening in N trials where in a single trial the probability of success is P is:
P M * (1 - P) N - M * N! / (M! * (N - M)!)   permalink embed save give gold [–] applepiefly314  647 points 648 points 649 points  2 years ago  (51 children) It is correct that if we flip a coin 2n times, the chances that we get n heads and n tails is ( (2n)!/(n!) 2 )/2 2n . A useful trick that lets us get our hand calculators to be sufficient and let's us see some deeper behavior is Stirling's approximation , which roughly tells you that a good approximation for n! is sqrt(2 * pi * n)*(n/e) n. When you plug this approximation in for the factorials in this coin problem, it simplifies beautifully.  What we get is that the probability of n heads and n tails after 2n flips is very well approximated by 1/sqrt(pi*n).  In our case of n=500,000 , my desk calculator gives me:
0.079788456%  Compare this to the exact value given in your W|A link:
0.079788436%  That is a relative error of only 0.000025% ! As our values for n gets larger, the relative error of this approximation will tend to 0.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] OldWolf2  114 points 115 points 116 points  2 years ago  (12 children) Here's another way to get the same result, using something I learned in high school.  A binomial distribution of n trials and probability p can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean np and variance np(1-p) .  The mode of a normal distribution is 1/sqrt(2.pi.variance) , so that gives us 1/sqrt(pi.n/2) , the same as your formula considering that your n is half the number of trials.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] gash789  119 points 120 points 121 points  2 years ago *  (4 children) Not to be annoying, but because I learnt it recently: while the normal approximation is equivalent when calculating probabilities close to the peak (as we are here), it cannot be trusted far out in the tails of the distribution. By contrast the Sterling approximation does not suffer such loss a bad loss of precision out in the tails. If you want more I can only point you to Jaynes Probability theory: the logic of science Pg 122 5.2.1   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (4 replies) load more comments (7 replies) [–] dmoore0988  8 points 9 points 10 points  2 years ago  (26 children) Could the same be applied to finding the probability of rolling a single 6-sided die 6 times and having each value come up as a result exactly once?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] reddallaboutit  30 points 31 points 32 points  2 years ago  (22 children) The chance of rolling 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 then 6:  (1/6) 6 = 1/46656.  But we can roll these in any order.  So there's 1|2|3|4|5|6, and 1|2|3|4|6|5, etc.  The number of ways to rearrange 6 distinct digits is 6! = 720.  So we end up with: 720/46656 = 0.01543209876...  Really, though, we computed: n! / n n for n = 6.  Stirling's approximation says:  n! / n n ~ sqrt(2 * pi * n) / e n  Using a calculator, when n = 6, the right hand side is: 0.01521943982...  So the two values are pretty close!  (The former minus the latter is about 0.00021265893.)  Stirling's approximation gets even better, by the way, as n increases.  So the approximation would be better if your question were about a die with more than 6 sides.   permalink embed save parent give gold [+] [deleted]  2 years ago *  (3 children) [deleted]   load more comments (3 replies) [–] johnboyjr29  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (11 children) what about rolling 6 dice at the same time and getting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] reddallaboutit  9 points 10 points 11 points  2 years ago  (8 children) Pretend the six dice, all rolled at once, land behind a curtain, and are then revealed one by one.

We can also approximate pi by throwing darts at a board (read about Monte Carlo approximations) or throwing sticks on the ground (see Buffon's needle ).   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] itisike  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I know about those. I thought pi from lots of coin flips was funny because it probably takes far longer to converge than most known formulas for pi.

So I can flip a coin 1 million times and approx. 1 in 125 times I do so it will land on heads the same amount as it does tails.  How about if I flip it 50 times, is it more likely to be 25:25 than 26:24?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Rannasha Computational Plasma Physics  1212 points 1213 points 1214 points  2 years ago *  (121 children) No, it's 1 in 1,250 times that it will land on heads as often as it does tails.  When you flip it 50 times, the odds of getting exactly 25 heads are 11.2%. Getting 26 heads has a chance of 10.8%. The outcome of having the same amount of heads and tails will always be the most likely outcome (assuming a fair coin), but when the amount of trials is very large, even the most likely outcome can be very unlikely.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] foodfighter  335 points 336 points 337 points  2 years ago  (22 children)  The outcome of having the same amount of heads and tails will always be the most likely outcome (assuming a fair coin), but when the amount of trials is very large, even the most likely outcome can be very unlikely.   Perfectly stated.  Upvote for you.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] WhiteyDude  68 points 69 points 70 points  2 years ago  (20 children) For me it's easy to picture in my head on a bell curve.  As /u/rannasha stated, 1,250 would be the peak of the curve. 499,999 and 500,001 would both be slightly lower, and the curve extends in both directions for every possible outcome of 1,000,000 flips, tapering out a long way no doubt. The "meat" of the bell would be pretty thick, with one thin line at exactly 500,000, marking the peak. The chances of landing exactly 500,000 is still extremely remote, but it's still the most likely outcome compared to all other possible outcomes.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] pokemans95  17 points 18 points 19 points  2 years ago  (1 child) As /u/OffensiveJerk posted above, we can see it on Wolfram for easy visualization.

A bell curve is continuous, whereas this is discrete. Small difference which doesn't matter much until you're working with the equations about them.  edit: here's an example of why it matters: the chance of getting exactly half of 1,000,001 coinflips to be heads is 0.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (12 replies) load more comments (5 replies) load more comments (1 reply) [–] WiglyWorm  6 points 7 points 8 points  2 years ago *  (35 children) It should be noted that this presumes an ideal coin flip.  In fact, a flipped coin actually has odds of about 51%/49%, with a bias toward the side that was up at the beginning of the coin flip.  http://econ.ucsb.edu/~doug/240a/Coin%20Flip.htm  Edit:  Also  http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0036144504446436  http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf    permalink embed save parent give gold [–] GoingToSimbabwe  4 points 5 points 6 points  2 years ago  (5 children) Also depends on what kind of coin someone is actually using. Iirc there're coins in some countries which are quite "unbalanced" (meaning one side is heavier than the other) which will have an impact on the flip. But since we are asuming an ideal coin flip, that should not matter.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] frenetix  7 points 8 points 9 points  2 years ago  (0 children) You can correct for this by flipping a coin twice.  Suppose you had a severely unbalanced coin that lands on "heads" 80% of the time.  Flip the coin twice.  You either end up with 2 heads (64%), heads then tails (16%), tails then heads (16%), or 2 tails (4%).  Ignore the 2 heads and 2 tails results.  The heads then tails is just as likely to occur as tails than heads.  So, if you're looking for a fair flip, you've got to flip twice.  Consider heads then tails as one result, and tails then heads as the other result.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Malak77  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Seems like you could make use of this fact because most people assume all coins are equal.

I know 50 and a million aren't exactly very large numbers but the probability of the most likely macrostate seems to be going in the wrong direction, 11.2% for 50 and 0.008% for a million, what am I too stupid to understand here?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Rannasha Computational Plasma Physics  194 points 195 points 196 points  2 years ago  (18 children) The term "macrostate" in thermodynamics refers to something a bit less precisely defined as the macrostate in this discussion. Thermodynamic macrostates are measured based on temperature, pressure, etc... Quantities that are not measured with unlimited accuracy. So when talking about the macrostate with temperature X, pressure Y, etc... you're not looking at those precise values but rather some interval around them corresponding to your measurement uncertainties.  In the coinflipping story, the more flips you do, the more specific the macrostate "50% heads" becomes. If instead you would look at the chance of getting heads between 49% and 51% of the time, you'd see that this chance goes up with more flips, whereas the chance of getting exactly 50% goes down.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] PrivateChicken  33 points 34 points 35 points  2 years ago  (11 children)  If instead you would look at the chance of getting heads between 49% and 51% of the time, you'd see that this chance goes up with more flips, whereas the chance of getting exactly 50% goes down.   This is one of the coolest things about probability for me. As a lay person, it fits my intuition, but it's weird that the small change results in opposite trends.   permalink embed save parent give gold [+] [deleted]  2 years ago *  (2 children) [removed]   [–] warfangle  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Is there an application (read: reason to do this) for integrating the probability curve of the probability of H% / T% as the number of trials approaches infinity?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] BurkeyAcademy Economics and Spatial Statistics  10 points 11 points 12 points  2 years ago  (0 children) To give a different (and correct) way to think about the two things that are happening:  1) As we observe more and more flips, we are getting more and more information about the true probability of heads.  So, with more information, we should increase the probability of getting within +/- (say,) 1% of 50%.  2)However, as we observe more flips, the number of possible unique outcomes we can observe increases.  With two flips, we can only observe 0%, 50%, or 100% heads.  With 4 flips we can observe  0, 25, 50, 75, or 100% heads, so we have to distribute the probability over a larger number of outcomes.  (Note that with odd numbers of flips, the probability of exactly 50% heads is always zero!)   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  4 points 5 points 6 points  2 years ago  (0 children) What our intuition tells us is precission - the more flips we try the closer it is to 50% but it's closer in percents.

The macrostate would be a collection of microstates, so for example the number of heads within 1% of half of all flips. The probability of this will go up - you are more likely to get between 490000 and 510000 heads in 1000000 flips than between 490 and 510 heads in 1000 flips.  EDIT: to be more precise, if N is the number of trials, the spread grows like sqrt(N) - so the relative spread changes like sqrt(N)/N = 1/sqrt(N) - that is, it falls.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] elenasto Gravitational Wave Detection  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Actually, 500000 heads would be more like a macrostate.

Error margin (although I don't think it's a question of stupidity).  With a million flips, you have a very high chance to be within 1% of the expected answer. In stuff like atomic decay where you have to count the number of atoms in scientific notation and your measurements are never 100% accurate, the answer will most likely be off by something like a thousandth of a percent, but your instruments won't be able to distinguish an error that small, so for any reasonable error margin, the result is 100% predictable.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Emilbjorn  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (0 children) If you flip 2 coins, it will be 2heads 25% of the time, 1heads1tails 50% and 2tails 25% of the time.  As more coins are flipped, the total 100% will be spread out over more possible configurations. For three coins for example, it will be (h=heads, t=tails): 3h 12.5%, 2h1t 37.5%, 1h2t 37.5%, 3t 12.5%. So the more coins, the more possible configurations there are, and it is possible to end up with any of them. As such the probability of any individual state is smaller with higher numbers.  If you're looking to thermodynamics, you can compare it with a Boltzmann distribution at higher temperatures vs low. The population of fx vibrational states are very localised at small temperatures (high population in the lower states) whereas higher temperatures spread the population out over the higher energy states aswell. (The dice program is symmetric though, whereas energy states aren't)  Don't know if my engineering ramble made sense, but i made an attempt anyway. :)   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Vectoor  5 points 6 points 7 points  2 years ago  (0 children) For the exact 50% the probability gets lower, but for ~50% with the same margins for error the probability gets higher...

While 0.008% seems small, it's still the most likely outcome because everything single toss coming up heads is still a possibility (a very small one, but still would have a possibility)  It's also about precision... Now what if you added up the probability of say everything in the range of 501,000:499,000 to 499,000:501,000.

E+deltaE where deltaE is much smaller than E (then dividing this number by the partition function to give a probability between zero and one).  The continuum limit gives us a density of states term. In short, the way it is taught in thermodynamics is essentially what others are positing as the solution; the micro states are either considered within a small range of discrete states or as a density of states, never as just states at a single energy because this probability would shrink with additional particles.   permalink embed save parent [–] heap42  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) i dont know about Thermodynamics, But getting 25 coins in 50 throws is FAAAAAAR more likely than hitting 500000 in one million. i mean following your logic it should be a lot more likely to hit 2 heads in 4 throws than hitting 1 head in 2 throws... which it obviously is not.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (2 replies) [–] hornless_unicorn  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (2 children) So would a graph of the probability distribution be a bell curve?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (0 children) You ask a very important question! The answer is that for large numbers of trials we can approximate the binomial distribution with a normal distribution. One reason to do this, as stated above by applepiefly314 and Rannasha, is that computing with large factorials is difficult.  To get this approximation we use the central limit theorem, one of the most useful results in probability theory!  Here is a page with some examples: https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/179  Note: applepiefly314 showed a good way of approximating factorials above using Stirling's approximation.

This question actually is one of the fundamentals of information theory.  Basically you are asking the probability of a typical set. For any empirical distribution (in your example the empirical dist is [26/50,24/50] = [13/25,12/25]) and expected distribution ([1/2,1/2] in your example)
P(empirical distribution) ~ 2 -n(D(P||Q)) P(expected distribution)
where P is the distribution of the observed sequence, Q is the expected sequence, D is the relative entropy function (\sum p(x) \log_2 p(x)/q(x) ) and n is number of samples.  In the case of an empirical distribution of [13/25,12/25] and expected distribution [1/2,1/2] the relative entropy is about .0012. So for n > 10000, the probability of this empirical distribution occurring is about 2 -12 less than the expected distribution.  In information theory typical sets can be used to show the direct part of things like the maximum amount of information which can go through a discrete memoryless channel, and also how to construct codes with unbreakable security over discrete memoryless channels.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (9 replies) [–] WazWaz  9 points 10 points 11 points  2 years ago  (2 children) And to be clear, the probability of HHHH is also the same as that of HTHT.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Rannasha Computational Plasma Physics  9 points 10 points 11 points  2 years ago  (0 children) True, but I wanted to phrase it in such a way that it would still be correct in the case of something other than a 50:50 coin-flip scenario.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] constantino1  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (0 children) and HHTT and TTHH and THTH and THHT and HTTH.

If you are voting in a state with 1,000,000 people, your vote will only make an actual difference to the outcome if the split of all other votes is either exactly equal, or if your side is down by exactly one.  As the math above shows, those two cases are extremely unlikely, and that was even when we imagined that the probability for any single voter to vote a certain way was exactly 0.5. If, as is more common, polls are showing a 52-48% split going in, then the likelihood of an "off center" outcome like exactly 500,000 votes for one side becomes ridiculously small.  The paradox is that many people know all this, and yet still vote (myself included).   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] lymn  13 points 14 points 15 points  2 years ago  (6 children) This cannot possibly be the correct way to look at things. Person X and person Y each poison you without knowing of the other's actions. Since neither were necessary to kill you (as the poison from the other person would have killed you) neither person harmed you, according to that logic.  Instead, you should look at how many votes the loser had, call that x. The first x+1 voters for the winner each contributed 1/(x+1) of the effort required to get them elected.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] ribi305  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (5 children) I get what you are saying, but the poison situation is a bit contrived and a stretch, so I'm not sure how much it helps. The fact is, your vote is only one vote. It is exactly the case that if you had not voted then your side would have exactly one vote fewer. This does not change the outcome of the election unless the vote was within one either way.  You can argue that you contributed 1/X, or "what if everyone thought that way?", but I still make the case that your vote only actually makes a difference of it swings the election.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] ribi305  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (2 children) Actually I think the poison situation also supports my point. We are not arguing about whether either person harmed you, but about whether or not each person made a difference to the outcome. I think it's valid for person X to say "the outcome will be the same whether or not I poison him".  Similarly, a voter can accurately say " I supported my side " but not "my vote made a difference".

The average over so many repetitions is extremely well approximated by a standard normal distribution, by the central limit theorem , so simply calculating in terms of the number of standard deviations around the mean is going to be a very good approximation.  The standard deviation for one coin flip is 1/2. By the central limit theorem, the standard deviation of the proportion of heads in N flips is approximately (1/2) / sqrt(N). So for N = 10 6 it's (1/2) / sqrt(1000000) = .5 x 10 -3 .  In the continuous model, you can model getting exactly 500,000 heads as getting more than 499,999.5 and less than 500,000.5. How many standard deviations is that? It's (.5 / 10 6 ) / (.5 x 10 -3 ) = 10 -3 = .001 standard deviations above and below 500,000. This is a miniscule interval, e.g. most tables of values for the standard normal distribution list values in increments of .01 standard deviations, and if you check the first value after z = 0 you can see it can't be more than .008.  For a more accurate approximate value, since we're on such a small interval, just pretend the height of the bell curve is equal to its peak value of 1/sqrt(2 pi). So the chance of being within values .001 standard deviations above and below the mean is roughly 1/sqrt(2 pi) * .002, which is about 0.00079788456.  (Comparing with Wolfram, this is actually accurate to 6 significant figures.)   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] jooke  9 points 10 points 11 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Why is looking up a value in a table more right than plugging a formula into Wolfram Alpha?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] mmmmmmmike  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (0 children) The point isn't looking up table values (that wasn't even necessary in what I wrote). The point is which expression you choose to calculate. I'm suggesting to compute the integral from -.001 to .001 of the standard normal density function. Even a graphing calculator can do that to high precision.  The calculation OP lists is extremely ill-posed (divide two extremely large, difficult to calculate numbers). As they mention, basically any computational system will fail if it hasn't been specifically designed to handle such a computation.

If you give it certain other ill-posed computations, it will fail or time out like every other computational system.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] jimmy_eat_womb  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (3 children) this is fascinating to me, and a clever way to avoid the extremely large and small values of the OP, but i do not understand where pi came from.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] mmmmmmmike  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (2 children) It comes from the formula for the density function of a standard normal distribution : 1/sqrt(2pi) e -1/2x 2 . When x is very small, the exponential term is close to 1, so 1/sqrt(2pi) is a good approximation.

Given the likelihood of a stock price going up or down (let's say 50% to keep with the coin analogy), the number of coin flips would be equivalent to a certain number of steps in time. So, if the stock increased in price every single step, the stock would be worth a ton and your option would make you a ton of money. But the odds of that are increasingly small as you increase the number of steps. So, basically what you can do is take your strike value K (the price you're fixing with your option) and calculate the future stock value for every outcome and find the difference. Ignore zeros and negative numbers as you wouldn't execute the option. So, then you multiply each of the potential profits by the odds of that being the outcome.  You sum all those values and you have a price for your option.

This is the probability for a specific event which when the number of trials increase, so will the number of possible outcomes thereby reducing the probability of obtaining a specific result.

But the probability of hitting exactly 50% will also go down.  You can look at the extreme case of just 2 flips. Half the time you'll end up with exactly 50% heads. With 4 flips, there are 16 possible outcome-sequences, but only 6 end up with exactly 50% heads (HHTT, HTTH, TTHH, HTHT, THTH, THHT).

I'll type out my reasoning, which may not be extremely eloquently phrased. The scenario is a bit more complicated than a coin toss, but we can approach it in roughly the same way.  First, we look at the probability of a single sequence with the right properties taking place. We need 5 events with probability 1/6 and 3 events with probability 2/3, so: (1/6) 5 * (2/3) 3 .  Next we count the number of sequences that contain 2 sixes and 3 threes. Call the six and three the "special numbers" for now. First we look at the number of ways we can put 5 special numbers in a sequence of 8. That's 8! / (5! * 3!) ways.  Now we look at the number of ways we can put 2 sixes in a sequence of 5 "special numbers" (the remaining special numbers will automatically be the 3 threes). That's 5! / (2! * 3!).  Multiplying everything gives us the total probability:  (1/6) 5 * (2/3) 3 * 8! / (5! * 3!) * 5! / (2! * 3!)  And after crossing out the 5! terms, we arrive at the answer.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (1 reply) [–] MajAsshole  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) And if you don't wanna do the math, there's a great app on android called probability distributions that does it for you (I'm sure one exists on ios add well). You need to select your distribution, which is binomial. Then, all you do is enter number of total attempts (n), probably of 1 success (p; this is .5 for coin flip, .1667 for rolling a 6, etc) and the number of successes you want to calculate odds for (x). You can then calculate odds for exactly x number of rolls, or > or < x. It also plots a graph so you can visualize how 4.3% is most likely, even if it itself is not very likely.

The arguments are: (how many successes, how many trials, probability of success), e.g.  dbinom(1, 1, 0.5)  Means getting 1 head in 1 coin toss (with probability of heads = 0.5). Answer is...  0.5  No surprises there. On to your question:  > dbinom(5 * 10^5, 10^6, 0.5)
[1] 0.0007978844  Which agrees with what everyone else said (0.08%).   I then carried on refreshing the formula and the difference didn't come out at 0 for quite a while, but was always between -2,500 and +2,500.   Because it's R, I can also look at this really easily. Let's generate some values around 500,000. I'm going to go with 5,000 in either direction, to ensure it captures your 2,500 interval and then some. Getting 1001 points between 495,000 to 505,000 should be enough to give a smooth plot.  > x = seq(from = 5 * 10^5 - 5000, to = 5 * 10^5 + 5000, length = 1001)
> plot(x, dbinom(x, 10^6, 0.5), type = "l")  This is what that looks like: http://i.imgur.com/p8TyBDi.png  So even +/- 2,000 is probably a good enough interval. But I'm using R, I can do better. Let's do an actual interval. By using qbinom instead, I can specify quantiles. So if I want to know the central 95% probability, I can do this:  > qbinom(c(0.025, 0.975), 10^6, 0.5)
[1] 499020 500980  This means that if you did 1,000,000 coin flips (with a fair coin, probability of heads = 0.5), 95% of the time you will get between 499,020 and 500,980 heads. Let's try some more quantiles:  > qbinom(c(0.005, 0.995), 10^6, 0.5)
[1] 498712 501288  99% of the time you will get between 498,712 and 501,288 heads.  > qbinom(c(0.00005, 0.99995), 10^6, 0.5)
[1] 498055 501945  99.99% of the time you will get between 498,055 and 501,945 heads. These are still only 3,890 apart, so a +/- 2,000 interval is good enough 99.99% of the time.  Edit: Oops, OP was talking about difference being +/- 2,500, but I was talking about +/- 2,000 from the centre (which will mean a +/- 4,000 difference). +/- 2,500 difference is good enough for 95% though:  > diff(qbinom(c(0.025, 0.975), 10^6, 0.5))

The random number in excel are not true random trials.  They are pseudo-random numbers which are generated by a deterministic mathematical progression.  The progression is started with a 'seed'.  The seed can be anything and in software the current time is often used (but not for cryptography).  This progression gives very random 'feeling' results, however if you start with the same seed, you will always get the same progression of random results.  If you have ever played a multiplayer strategy game such as Starcraft, each computer is actually running the full simulation in lock-step.  They all start with the same random 'seed' and thus generate the same results.   permalink embed save give gold [–] scrotch  6 points 7 points 8 points  2 years ago  (4 children) In my first C programming class, many years ago, we had an assignment to roll two dice (pick two random numbers from 1 to 6) and graph their sums.

The server and client would both know the (player-specific?) seed for random bullet spread calculations, which enabled the client to predict the result without waiting for the round-trip to the server, enabling better responsiveness. You don't want to wait >20ms to for each gunshot to complete!  This was actually patched out at the end of last year, and now the server keeps this seed secret - because some hacks were using it to compensate for the random spread. Now the client doesn't know the RNG state, and therefore cannot predict the spread that will be applied. A side effect is that what looks like a bullet hit on client-side might not necessarily be a hit on (authoritative) server-side, and vice versa.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Roquer  6 points 7 points 8 points  2 years ago  (1 child) It has less to do with the AI but more with how you can resume play if one player drops.

If we are playing 2v1AI, one of us is the server and is 'running the AI simulation'.

If your client had to receive full information about the game state every frame, every little network hiccup would be very apparent to you. Instead, what generally happens is that both the server and the clients are running some version of the simulation.  One way to handle this is called deterministic lockstep. If you can get server and client to run the same simulation (and that simulation is 100% deterministic), then the only information that needs to be transmitted is inputs that can change the state. Clients and server exchange information on what inputs have been entered, and everyone runs the same calculations on those inputs.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (1 reply) [–] Xelath  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (1 child) The person you're responding to means when you play multiplayer.

For coin flips, P=0.5. So the distribution of the results of all your trials is going to be a Gaussian/Normal Function with the standard deviation given above.  For example, if you flip 1,000,000 coins, the mean number of heads will be 500,000 and the standard deviation will be 500. This basically means that 68% of the time, you will get between 499,500 and 500,500 heads, and 95% of the time you will get between 499,000 and 501,000 heads. The actual probability of getting 500,000 heads is easy, just 1/(2*pi*S) = 0.0008 = 0.08%, like everyone else is getting.

There is a quick approximation which works for any even number of coins, and gets more accurate as the number of coins goes up.  If you flip 2n coins and want exactly n heads and exactly n tails then the probability that this happens is (2n)!/(n!) 2 / 2 2n or 2n_C_n / 2 2n or (2n n) / 2 2n in trying to write different representations of the binomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways 2n objects can be selected exactly n at a time.  Now use the first approximation for pi (as n gets larger the approximation gets better): http://functions.wolfram.com/Constants/Pi/09/ Here \sqrt(\pi) is approximately 2 2n / [ \sqrt(n) (2n n) ].
Rearranging we get that (2n n) / 2 2n is approximately 1 / \sqrt(\pi n).  So the number of ways to flip 2n coins and get exactly n heads and exactly n tails is approximately 1 / \sqrt(\pi n).  For 1,000,000 coins n=500,000 the approximation gives 0.00797884, which is really really close to the correct answer.  You can use this to get a better idea for what happens for various numbers of coins where the number of heads equals the number of tails without having to compute many examples explicitly.   permalink embed save give gold [–] nijiiro  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (1 child) An alternative way of deriving this approximation is to approximate the binomial distribution with the normal distribution, and then use the midpoint method to evaluate the corresponding integral.  The pdf of the normal approximation is 1/sqrt(2πσ 2 ) exp(−(x−μ) 2 /(2σ 2 )), where the variance σ 2 is (2n)/4 = n/2 and the mean μ is n. Substituting these values in and integrating over the interval [μ−1/2,μ+1/2] (cf. continuity correction) using the midpoint method, we get 1/sqrt(2πσ 2 ) = 1/sqrt(πn).   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (1 reply) [–] MoonlightSandwich  3 0 Answer Link 2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (9 children) A slightly off topic question: what's the probability of a coin landing on its edge (i.e. neither heads or tails)?

For a thin coin, of the possible angles the coin can land at, the angular size of the region where the coin will land with the projection of its COG within the narrow side is approximately 2 * t/r rad.  The total range of angles the coin can occupy is 2 * pi rad, so the probability of the coin landing on its edge is approximately (2 * t/r) / (2 * pi) = t/(pi * r).  For a quarter this is 1.75 / (pi * 12.13) = 4.6%.  Since we don't observe anywhere near this large a rate in real life, we know the assumption that angular momentum is lost on striking the table is a bad one.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (4 replies) [–] jedi-son  2 0 Answer Link 1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child) (.5 1000000)(1000000 choose 500000). ie every outcome has the same likelihood of 1/2 to the one millionth power and there are 1 million choose 500000 combinations where there are exactly an even number of heads and tails.   permalink embed save give gold load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (304 replies) about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

So only slightly misleading   permalink embed save give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (2 children) True. So the odds are 1.5% for Clinton winning and 1.5% for the 'Sanders side'  of the coin.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] WT14  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (1 child) That's not the title of the OP though. That's framing the question two different ways.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I agree.  So mathematically speaking, his statement is incorrect.  But I think, especially given the subreddit we are on, his intended point is 'here are the odds of Hillary doing what she did last night'.

Each event is 50-50, but the odds of them all happening independently is quite low. Sure, the odds of the last one happening is 50-50 after all the others happened, but statistics can tell us the chances of all of them coming up Clinton in a row.  I think /u/PreecherMan 's example with coins at friends houses is pretty good at showing how unlikely it is for all of them to land on one side.   permalink embed save give gold [–] PreecherMan [ S ]  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (5 children) Oh man. I'm getting into internet arguments again :)  Alright. Let's assume you're right. Let's replay this game. You can pick six different friends of yours and they can each toss a coin at their independent houses (until now, do you agree that this is the same situation as with the coin tosses in this case?).  If I understand you correctly, you say that these independent events are still 50-50. If you stick to that, you should be happy if I offered you a bet where I pay you 20 bucks when all six independent coins come up heads, but you pay me 10 bucks if they don't. According to you (again, if I got you right), you should win 20 bucks with a prob of 50% (which has an expected value of 10 bucks) and lose 10 bucks with a prob of 50% (expected value = -5 bucks) so you would win 5 bucks...

We are saying 'what are the odds of flipping heads 6 times in a row?'  Those are two very different questions, statistically speaking.  The answer to the first, as you said, is 50-50.  But the answer to the second is MUCH lower, 1.56%.  As you admitted yourself, the cumulation of the odds are against the likelihood of so many successive flips coming up heads. There is nothing wrong with /u/PreecherMan 's math except for the technicality mentioned by /u/WT14 , which is irrelevant when all we are doing is refuting this claim that the odds are 50-50.   permalink embed save give gold [–] JoshOliday Bernie Squad- Corporal  -3 points -2 points -1 points  2 years ago  (14 children) That may be true if the coin is the same, in the same place, under the same conditions. However, these coins and flips were all independent of each other. The statistics you're quoting aren't exactly correct.   permalink embed save give gold [–] PreecherMan [ S ]  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (13 children) They are not exactly correct. The exactly correct number is 1.5625%.  Here's how you do it:  If the game is "toss a coin once", then the chance is at 50% of getting heads.  If the game is "toss a coin twice" then the chance is at 25% to get heads two times in a row. Basically, you have four outcomes:   heads - heads  heads - tails  tails - heads  tails - tails   So 1 out of 4 = 25% or 50% x 50% = 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 = 25%  Play the game further (tossing a coin six times and get the same result every time) and you get 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 aka 0.5 6 = 0.015625 = 1.5625%.  Trust me.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] InvisibleBlue Europe  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) the actual probability is closer to 51 - 49 because of geometry of the object you're tossing and how the mass is spread out non-uniformly on the coin and sides of the coin.  If you spin the coin instead of tossing, odds get to 70 or 80% tails up because the extra weight on the heads causes a positive feedback loop that topples it over on that side most of the time.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] WT14  -1 points 0 points 1 point  2 years ago  (11 children)  Trust me.   Your math here frames your claim differently than the claim in the title though. The title doesn't say flip heads 6 times it says get the same result 6 times.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] pjk922 Massachusetts  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (6 children) It's the same thing. The chance of Hillary winning (regardless if she picked heads or tales) is .5 per event. .5 6 = .0156   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) His argument is that the title is phrased more generally, saying the odds of getting the same result 6 times, which would include the odds of flipping heads 6 times in a row or flipping tails 6 times in a row. So the result should be double (3.12%) what OP reported.  However, this is just to be technically correct in the title.  Hillary's odds of doing what she did last night are still correctly 1.56%, since the other 1.56% odds would be for Bernie winning all of the coin tosses.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] WT14  -1 points 0 points 1 point  2 years ago  (4 children) That's not the title of the OP though.

Then here we go: You are willfully misinterpreting the title. You know what I am saying. You know that I am referring to yesterday. Nothing else makes sense. Or do you think I would post something in the /r/SandersForPresident sub that says "rolling a six with a die has a chance of one sixth"? Yes? Does that make any sense? Is it relevant at all? A little common sense please?  You have said that I claim something different in the title than in my examples. That is incorrect. You just incorrectly assume that "getting the same result each time" means "getting tails six times or getting heads six times". It doesn't mean that. "result" = "winning". So the title is correct and you are wrong :)   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Bernie's supporters' obsession with semantics is making some of us look like crybabies.  Like that post saying that Bernie should have won the coin tosses because the rules said 'coin flip to determine who loses the delegate' or something like that. That is arguing semantics, and it frankly looks quite silly to try to pry at the results with arguments like that.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

Say you have four flips. You can only get four heads in a row if every flip is a head. But you can get two heads and two tails in six different ways:   Head, Head, Tail, Tail  Tail, Tail, Head, Head  THHT  HTTH  THTH  HTHT   This means that it is six times more likely that you will get two of each than all heads.  When you have big numbers, you can't list all the possibilities, so you have to use a more complicated formula as Bradm77 posted.   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (0 children) I get it now because of your example.

Yes, it's much greater. There is only one possible combination where it lands all heads, and that requires it to land heads every time. There are a bunch of combinations that result in it landing with exactly 50 heads. If the first flip doesn't land heads, that's fine, you can make it up later.  According to a binomial calculator I found here (with chance of success .5, 100 trials, and number of successes 50), it is about a 8% chance that you get exactly 50 heads. However, the chance that it is close to 50 (say 40-60), is really high.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Bradm77  17 0 Answer Link 16 points 17 points 18 points  5 years ago  (9 children) The formula for calculating this is:  (m + n)!/(m! x n!) x p m x q n  where p is the probability of success (in our case .5) and q is 1-p (again, .5) and m + n = the total number of repetitions (in our case, 100 flips) and m and n are success and failures, respectively (in our case, both are 50).  That leaves you with:  (100!)/(50! x 50!) x 0.5 50 x 0.5 50  This is really hard to calculate because the factorials make the numbers really big but the answer ends up being about 7.959%.

Instead of counting how many different combinations there are you can use the formula above.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  -3 points -2 points -1 points  5 years ago  (1 child) As someone who was never too good at Maths, this is how i see this formula.  (m + n)??/(m?x n?) x p?m x qn?????????!!!!!! :@:@   permalink embed save parent [–] Bradm77  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (0 children) The exclamation points are the factorial symbol.  A factorial just mean that you take the number before it and multiply it by every number below itself until you get to 1.  So 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.  100! = 100 x 99 x 98 x 97 x ... all the way down to 1.  Also, p m is p times p, repeated m times.  So 2 5 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 and 0.5 3 = 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] kitsovereign  3 0 Answer Link 2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (0 children) I can tell you the actual math and formulas, but let's keep it simple and abstract.  First of all, how many outcomes are there? If you flip one coin, just two. If you flip two coins, four. If you flip three coins, it's eight - two for the first times two for the second times two for the third. Simple numbers.  Flip 4 coins, and you're at 16 outcomes, a 2-digit number. Flip 10 coins, and and you're at a 4-digit number. 100 coins is a 31-digit number. Yikes! Roughly "a gajillion."  So, to answer the question you asked out-right: are the odds of an even 50-50 split better than all-heads? Well, of the gajillion outcomes for your hundred flips, there's only one where all the coins come up heads. Even if you're also counting "all tails", that's just two measly outcomes out of a gajillion - a drop in the bucket. (For comparison: There are 100 outcomes where you get 99 heads and 1 tails.)  Now think of how many ways you could get 50 heads and 50 tails. You could flip 50 heads in a row and then 50 tails in a row; or vice versa; you could have all the even flips be heads and the odd ones be tails; or vice versa; you could - why do I need to list them out? We've just come up with four ways. There's actually "a bunch" of ways - small compared to the "gajillion" outcomes, but still easily bigger than the single way to get all heads.  (The exact values of "gajillion" and "bunch" are left as an exercise to the reader.)  Now hold on a dang moment. Doesn't increasing the sample size (that is, the number of flips) actually decrease my odds of getting exactly 50-50? If I flip twice, I have four options: heads-heads, heads-tails, tails-heads, and tails-tails. So I've got even odds of coming up with exactly 50-50. If I flip 100 times, I'm far more likely to get 53-47 or 48-52 or something like that, right?  Well, right. Here's the catch: Increasing the sample size doesn't increase your odds that your experimental data will match the exact odds. Rather, it decreases the likelihood that your experimental data will be far off from the exact odds.  If you flip two coins, you have even odds of thinking that all coin flips have the same outcome! If you flip three coins, you have a disaster - you're either going to get "100-0" or "67-33." However, if you flip a larger amount of times - even if you flip an odd amount of times, where it'd be impossible to get an even 50-50 split - the chances that you'll get results close to 50-50 increases, and the odds that you'll get wacky results like all-heads will shoot down.   permalink embed save give gold [–] air139  3 0 Answer Link 2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (0 children) To explain this to a five year old, make a flow chart. Like this http://www.mathsonline.co.uk/nonmembers/resource/plans/prob_coin.gif Then after making 100 columns count all the lines that have equal heads and tails.

Lets drop the numbers down to make it more manageable.  Flip a coin 4 times.  Draw a tree, almost like a family tree, except this new race does not need a mom and a dad, they just pop out kids at will.  Start with the first 2 beings in this new world.  Heads (H) and Tails (T).  Magically they each have 2 kids of their own, who are named H and T.  Those kids each have 2 kids of their own conveniently named H and T as well. And then again, once more.  4 generations, 4 coin flips.  Follow the path from top to bottom.  This will show you, visually, all the possibilities of the coin's Heads or Tails results.  16 different paths for the coin to follow as it lands on H or T.  Only one of those paths is HHHH and another is only TTTT.  Looking at the tree, their is 6 paths that end up as a 50/50 split:  HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, TTHH.  That means there is 2 chances for all one side, and 6 chances for 50/50.  This is shown as 2:6.  This ca be reduced down to 1:3.  3 times more likely to have an exact 50/50 ratio as opposed to all the same.  The reason for this:  When we counted those 50/50's, we did not care about the order that the result happened in, just the final tally.  If we were to go in specifically wanting HHTT in that exact order we would only have one possibility just like HHHH.  This ratio of 3:1 will change drastically though as you increase the number of flips. This is becasue at 100 flips, you still only have 2 chances for the coin to always have been either H or T.  While the number of results that lead to an exact 50/50 result will keep increasing as you add coin flips.   permalink embed save give gold [–] lalalalalalala71  1 0 Answer Link 0 points 1 point 2 points  5 years ago *  (0 children)  So, if I flip a coin 100 times, is the likeliness of it landing exactly 50 times on either side any greater than it landing all 100 times on the same side?   Short, non-numerical answer: yes it is, because there's only two ways for it landing all 100 times on the same side: either it lands heads every single time, or it lands tails every single time. For the other option, it can land heads the first 50 times and tails the other 50, or the other way around, or 10 heads then 10 tails then 10 heads (...), or a huge number of other possible combinations of heads and tails totalling 50 of each. This number of combinations is greater for 50/50 than any other pair of numbers.  Edit: the odds for 50/50 are greater than any other pair, if you count 51/49 as different from 49/51.   permalink embed save give gold [–] reached86  -1 0 Answer Link -2 points -1 points 0 points  5 years ago  (2 children) It lands on heads more often due to the minute increased weight of the coin on one side.   permalink embed save give gold [–] cruisintom  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 years ago  (1 child) Which coin?

Essentially, as Bradm77 said, it's about 8%. But it being off by one (either heads or tails winning) is probably 8.5%, and being off by one OR two would be even more likely.   permalink embed save give gold [–] NightlyNews  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 years ago  (0 children)  But it being off by one (either heads or tails winning) is probably 8.5%, and being off by one OR two would be even more likely.   The chances of it being either 49 or 51 heads is obviously higher than it being exactly 50 because that is two very slightly less (about .1%) separate occurrences compared to one.  It's about 7.8% twice, once for 49 heads and once for 51 heads. So it is much more accurate to say that there is a  ~15.6% chance of it being one off perfect 50/100 in either direction.   permalink embed save parent give gold [+] SecretDragoon  comment score below threshold -12 0 Answer Link -13 points -12 points -11 points  5 years ago  (3 children) What you're asking is "If I flipped a coin 100 times how many of them will be heads?" The probability is 50. You can't give an exact number like you want. The probability of a heads is 1/2. 1/2 over 100 times is still going to be 1/2 of those 100 times.   permalink embed save give gold [–] harrisonbeaker  5 points 6 points 7 points  5 years ago  (1 child) This is wrong in so many ways   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] synJstarcraft  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 years ago  (0 children) This actually really caught me off guard.

Coin flipping   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   "Heads or Tails" redirects here. For other uses, see Heads or Tails (disambiguation) .  For coin tossing as specific to the sport of cricket, see Toss (cricket) .     Tossed coin    Coin flipping , coin tossing , or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands to choose between two alternatives, sometimes to resolve a dispute between two parties. It is a form of sortition which inherently has only two possible and equally likely outcomes .

Coin flipping was known to the Romans as navia aut caput ("ship or head"), as some coins had a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the other. [1] In England, this was referred to as cross and pile . [1] [2] The expression Heads or Tails results from heads and tails being considered complementary body parts.  Process [ edit ]  During a coin toss, the coin is thrown into the air such that it rotates edge-over-edge several times. Either beforehand or when the coin is in the air, an interested party calls "heads" or "tails", indicating which side of the coin that party is choosing. The other party is assigned the opposite side. Depending on custom, the coin may be caught; caught and inverted; or allowed to land on the ground. When the coin comes to rest, the toss is complete and the party who called correctly or was assigned the upper side is declared the winner.  It is possible for a coin to land on its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even on a flat surface it is possible for a coin to land on its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. [3]  Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped. [4]  The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides; it need not be a circulating coin as such. Larger coins tend to be more popular than smaller ones. Some high-profile coin tosses, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Super Bowl, use custom-made ceremonial medallions. [5] [6]  Three-way [ edit ]  Three-way coin flips are also possible, by a different process – this can be done either to choose two out of three, or to choose one out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, either reverse this (the odd coin out is the winner ), or add a regular two-way coin flip between the remaining players as a second step. Note that the three-way flip is 87.5% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, which occurs 1/8 of the time due to the chances being 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.5, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that "heads" or "tails" be called. A famous example of such a three-way coin flip (choose two out of three) is dramatized in Friday Night Lights (originally a book , subsequently film and TV series ), where three high school football teams with identical records use a three-way coin flip – at a truck stop – to determine which two will advance to the playoffs. [7] [8] A legacy of this coin flip was to reduce the use of coin flips to break ties in Texas sports, instead using point-systems to reduce the frequency of ties.  Use in dispute resolution [ edit ]     The coin toss at the start of Super Bowl XLIII    Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.     Navy-Notre Dame coin toss    Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football , volleyball , and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame , and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The XFL , a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style "opening scramble," in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football , in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football.  In an association football match, the team winning the coin toss chooses which goal to attack in the first half; the opposing team kicks off for the first half. For the second half, the teams switch ends, and the team that won the coin toss kicks off. Coin tosses are also used to decide which team has the pick of going first or second in a penalty shoot-out . Before the early-1970s introduction of the penalty shootout , coin tosses were occasionally needed to decide the outcome of tied matches. The most famous instance of this was the semifinal game of the 1968 European Championship in Italy between Italy and the Soviet Union , which finished 0-0 after extra time. Italy won, and went on to become European champions. [9]     Tossing a coin is common in many sports, such as cricket , where it is used to decide which team gets the choice of bowling or batting first. Shown are Don Bradman and Gubby Allen  tossing for innings .    In cricket the toss is often significant, as the decision whether to bat or bowl first can influence the outcome of the game. Similarly, in tennis a coin toss is used in professional matches to determine which player serves first. The player who wins the toss decides whether to serve first or return, while the loser of the toss decides which end of the court each player plays on first.  In duels a coin toss was sometimes used to determine which combatant had the sun at his back. [10] In some other sports, the result of the toss is less crucial and merely a way to fairly choose between two more or less equal options.  The National Football League also has a coin toss for tie-breaking among teams for playoff berths and seeding, but the rules make the need for coin toss, which is random rather than competitive, very unlikely. A similar procedure breaks ties for the purposes of seeding in the NFL Draft ; these coin tosses are more common, since the tie-breaking procedure for the draft is much less elaborate than the one used for playoff seeding.  Major League Baseball once conducted a series of coin flips as a contingency on the last month of its regular season to determine home teams for any potential one-game playoff games that might need to be added to the regular season. Most of these cases did not occur. From the 2009 season , the method to determine home-field advantage was changed. [11]  Fédération Internationale d'Escrime rules use a coin toss to determine the winner of a fencing match that remains tied at the end of a " sudden death " extra minute of competition. Although in most international matches this is now done electronically by the scoring apparatus. [ citation needed ]  In the United States  Asa Lovejoy and Francis W. Pettygrove , who each owned the claim to the land that would later become Portland, Oregon , wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns of Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine ; Pettygrove won the coin flip . [12]  Scientists sometimes use coin flipping to determine the order in which they appear on the list of authors of scholarly papers . [13]  Politics [ edit ]  Australia [ edit ]  In December 2006, Australian television networks Seven and Ten , which shared the broadcasting of the 2007 AFL Season , decided who would broadcast the Grand Final with the toss of a coin. Network Ten won. [ citation needed ]  Canada [ edit ]  In some jurisdictions, a coin is flipped to decide between two candidates who poll equal number of votes in an election , or two companies tendering equal prices for a project. For example, a coin toss decided a City of Toronto tender in 2003 for painting lines on 1,605 km of city streets: the bids were $161,110.00 ($100.3800623 per km), $146,584.65 ($91.33 per km, exactly), and two equal bids of $111,242.55 ($69.31 per km, exactly).  Philippines [ edit ]  " Drawing of lots " is one of the methods to break ties to determine a winner in an election; the coin flip is considered an acceptable variant. Each candidate will be given five chances to flip a coin; the candidate with the most number of "heads" wins. The 2013 mayoral election in San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro was decided on a coin flip, with a winner being proclaimed after the second round when both candidates remained tied in the first round. [14]  United Kingdom [ edit ]  In the United Kingdom, if a local or national election has resulted in a tie where candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, then the winner can be decided either by drawing straws/lots, coin flip, or drawing a high card in pack of cards. [15] [16]  United States [ edit ]  In the United States , a coin toss determines the class of the senators of a state being added to the Union, with the new state's senators due to be entering the US Senate . [17] A number of states provide for "drawing lots" in the event an election ends in a tie - this is usually resolved by a coin toss or picking names from a hat. [18] A 2017 election to the 94th District of the Virginia House of Delegates resulted in both Republican incumbent David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds tied with exactly 11,608 votes. Under state law, the election was to be decided by drawing a name from a bowl, although a coin toss would also have been an acceptable option. The chair of the Board of Elections drew the film canister with Yancey's name, and he was declared the winner. [19] Additionally, the outcome of the draw determined control of the entire House, as Republicans won 50 of the other 99 seats and Democrats 49. A Yancey win extended the Republican advantage to 51-49, whereas a Simmonds win would have resulted in a 50-50 tie. As there is no provision for breaking ties in the House as a whole, this would have forced a power sharing agreement between the two parties. [20]  Physics [ edit ]  The outcome of coin flipping has been studied by Persi Diaconis and his collaborators. They have demonstrated that a mechanical coin flipper which imparts the same initial conditions for every toss has a highly predictable outcome – the phase space is fairly regular. Further, in actual flipping, people exhibit slight bias – "coin tossing is fair to two decimals but not to three. That is, typical flips show biases such as .495 or .503." [21]  In studying coin flipping, to observe the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, so that when the speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time. [21]  Moreover, their theoretical analysis of the physics of coin tosses predicts a slight bias for a caught coin to be caught the same way up as it was thrown, with a probability of around 0.51, [22] though a subsequent attempt to verify this experimentally gave ambiguous results. [23] Stage magicians and gamblers, with practice, are able to greatly increase this bias, whilst still making throws which are visually indistinguishable from normal throws. [21]  Since the images on the two sides of actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to slightly favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing. Coin spinning is much more likely to be biased than flipping, and conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.  Counterintuitive properties [ edit ]  Human intuition about conditional probability is often very poor and can give rise to some seemingly surprising observations. For example, if the successive tosses of a coin are recorded as a string of "H" and "T", then for any trial of tosses, it is twice as likely that the triplet TTH will occur before THT than after it. It is three times as likely that THH will precede HHT, than that THH will follow HHT. [24] (See Penney's game )  Mathematics [ edit ]  The mathematical abstraction of the statistics of coin flipping is described by means of the Bernoulli process ; a single flip of a coin is a Bernoulli trial . In the study of statistics, coin-flipping plays the role of being an introductory example of the complexities of statistics. A commonly treated textbook topic is that of checking if a coin is fair .  Telecommunications [ edit ]  Further information: Commitment scheme  There is no reliable way to use a true coin flip to settle a dispute between two parties if they cannot both see the coin—for example, over the phone. The flipping party could easily lie about the outcome of the toss. In telecommunications and cryptography , the following algorithm can be used:   Alice and Bob each choose a random string, "ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd" and "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" respectively.  Alice chooses an outcome for an imaginary coin flip, such as "tail"  Bob sends Alice his random string "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd"  Alice immediately computes a cryptographic hash of the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd", which is 59dea408d43183a3937957e71a4bcacc616d9cbc and sends it to Bob  Alice asks Bob: "heads or tails"?  Bob says, for instance, "heads".  Alice tells him she's just won, and proves it by showing the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd".  Bob can check that Alice didn't lie by computing the SHA-1 of the string himself  Furthermore, Bob by providing his own randomly generated string guarantees that Alice wasn't able to precompute an image pair of "tail/random string" or "head/random string".   Lotteries [ edit ]  The New Zealand  lottery game Big Wednesday uses a coin toss. If a player matches all 6 of their numbers, the coin toss will decide whether they win a cash jackpot (minimum of NZ$25,000) or a bigger jackpot with luxury prizes (minimum of NZ$2 million cash, plus value of luxury prizes.) The coin toss is also used in determining the Second Chance winner's prize.  Clarifying feelings [ edit ]  A technique attributed to Sigmund Freud to help in making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I want you to do is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." [25]  Danish poet Piet Hein 's book Grooks includes a poem on a similar theme:   A Psychological Tip  Whenever you're called on to make up your mind, And you're hampered by not having any, The best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find, Is simply by spinning a penny. No—not so that chance shall decide the affair While you're passively standing there moping; But the moment the penny is up in the air, You suddenly know what you're hoping.

to the chance expectation.  If a subject scores consistently higher or
lower than the chance expectation after a large number of attempts,
one can calculate the probability of such a score due purely to
chance, and then argue, if the chance probability is sufficiently
small, that the results are evidence for the existence of some
mechanism (precognition, telepathy, psychokinesis, cheating, etc.)
which allowed the subject to perform better than chance would seem to
permit.  Suppose you ask a subject to guess, before it is flipped, whether a
coin will land with heads or tails up.  Assuming the coin is fair (has
the same probability of heads and tails), the chance of guessing
correctly is 50%, so you'd expect half the guesses to be correct and
half to be wrong.  So, if we ask the subject to guess heads or tails
for each of 100 coin flips, we'd expect about 50 of the guesses to be
correct.  Suppose a new subject walks into the lab and manages to
guess heads or tails correctly for 60 out of 100 tosses.  Evidence of
precognition, or perhaps the subject's possessing a telekinetic power
which causes the coin to land with the guessed face up?  Well,…no.
In all likelihood, we've observed nothing more than good luck.  The
probability of 60 correct guesses out of 100 is about 2.8%, which
means that if we do a large number of experiments flipping 100 coins,
about every 35 experiments we can expect a score of 60 or better,
purely due to chance.  But suppose this subject continues to guess about 60 right
out of a hundred, so that after ten runs of 100 tosses—1000
tosses in all, the subject has made 600 correct guesses.
The probability of that happening purely by chance is less
than one in seven billion, so it's time to start thinking
about explanations other than luck.  Still, improbable things
happen all the time: if you hit a golf ball, the odds it
will land on a given blade of grass are millions to one, yet
(unless it ends up in the lake or a sand trap) it is
certain to land on some blades of grass.  Finally, suppose this “dream subject” continues to guess 60%
of the flips correctly, observed by multiple video cameras,
under conditions prescribed by skeptics and debunkers, using
a coin provided and flipped by The Amazing Randi himself, with
a final tally of 1200 correct guesses in 2000 flips.  You'd
have to try the 2000 flips more than 5×10 18 times before you'd expect that result to occur by chance.
If it takes a day to do 2000 guesses and coin flips, it
would take more than 1.3×10 16 years of
2000 flips per day before you'd expect to see 1200 correct
guesses due to chance.  That's more than a million times
the age of the universe, so you'd better get started soon!  Claims of evidence for the paranormal are usually based upon
statistics which diverge so far from the expectation due to chance
that some other mechanism seems necessary to explain the experimental
results.  To interpret the results of our RetroPsychoKinesis
experiments, we'll be using the mathematics of probability and
statistics, so it's worth spending some time explaining how we go
about quantifying the consequences of chance.     Note to mathematicians: The following discussion of probability
is deliberately simplified to consider only binomial and normal distributions
with a probability of 0.5, the presumed probability of success in
the experiments in question.  I decided that
presenting and discussing the equations for arbitrary probability
would only decrease the probability that readers would persevere
and arrive at an understanding of the fundamentals of probability
theory.    Twelve and a half cents: one bit!  In slang harking back to the days of gold doubloons and pieces of
eight, the United States quarter-dollar coin is nicknamed “two bits”.
The Fourmilab radioactive random
number generator produces a stream of binary ones and zeroes, or bits .  Since we expect the generator to produce ones and
zeroes with equal probability, each bit from the generator is
equivalent to a coin flip: heads for one and tails for zero.  When we run
experiments with the generator, in effect, we're flipping a binary coin , one bit —twelve and a
half cents!     Two Bits    One Bit            Heads  Tails    Heads  Tails     (We could, of course, have called zero heads and one tails; since both
occur with equal probability, the choice is arbitrary.) Each bit
produced by the random number generator is a flip of our one-bit coin.
Now the key thing to keep in mind about a genuine random number
generator or flip of a fair coin is that it has no memory or,
as mathematicians say, each bit from the generator or flip is independent .  Even if, by chance, the coin has come up heads
ten times in a row, the probability of getting heads or tails on the
next flip is precisely equal.  Gamblers who've seen a coin come up
heads ten times in a row may believe “tails is way overdue”, but the
coin doesn't know and couldn't care less about the last ten flips; the
next flip is just as likely to be the eleventh head in a row as the
tail that breaks the streak.  Even though there is no way whatsoever to predict the outcome of the
next flip, if we flip a coin a number of times, the laws of
probability allow us to predict, with greater accuracy as the number
of flips increases, the probability of obtaining various results.  In
the discussion that follows, we'll ignore the order of the flips and
only count how many times the coin came up heads.  Since heads is one
and tails is zero, we can just add up the results from the flips, or
the bits from the random generator.  Four Flips  Suppose we flip a coin four times.  Since each flip can come up heads
or tails, there are 16 possible outcomes, tabulated below, grouped by
the number of heads in the four flips.     Number of Heads  Results of Flips  Number of Ways    0       1    1                       4    2                                 6    3                       4    4       1      Number of Ways summarises how many different ways the results
of the four flips could end up with a given number of heads.  Since
the only way to get zero heads is for all four flips to be tails,
there's only one way that can occur.  One head out of four flips can
happen four different ways since each of the four flips could have
been the head.  Two heads out of four flips can happen six different
ways, as tabulated.  And since what's true of heads applies equally to
tails, there are four ways to get three heads and one way to get four.  Mathematically, the number of ways to get x heads (or tails) in n flips is spoken of as
the “number of combinations of n things taken x at a time”, which is written as:     This, it turns out, can be calculated for any positive integers n and x whatsoever, as follows.     For example, if we plug in 4 for n and 2 for x ,
we get  4! / (2! (4 − 2)!) = 4! / (2! 2!) = 24 / (2 2) = 24 / 4 = 6  as expected.
Plotting the number of ways we can get different numbers of
heads yields the following graph.     Probability  Since the coin is fair, each flip has an equal chance of coming up
heads or tails, so all 16 possible outcomes tabulated above are
equally probable.  But since there are 6 ways to get 2 heads, in four
flips the probability of two heads is greater than that of
any other result.  We express probability as a number between 0 and 1.
A probability of zero is a result which cannot ever occur: the
probability of getting five heads in four flips is zero.  A
probability of one represents certainty: if you flip a coin, the
probability you'll get heads or tails is one (assuming it
can't land on the rim,  fall into a black hole, or some such).  The probability of getting a given number of heads from
four flips is, then, simply the number of ways that
number of heads can occur, divided by the number of total
results of four flips, 16.  We can then tabulate the
probabilities as follows.     Number of Heads  Number of Ways  Probability    0  1  1/16 = 0.0625    1  4  4/16 = 0.25    2  6  6/16 = 0.375    3  4  4/16 = 0.25    4  1  1/16 = 0.0625     Since we are absolutely certain the number of heads we get in four
flips is going to be between zero and four, the probabilities of the
different numbers of heads should add up to 1.  Summing the
probabilities in the table confirms this.  Further, we can calculate
the probability of any collection of results by adding the individual
probabilities of each.  Suppose we'd like to know the probability of
getting fewer than three heads from four flips.  There are three ways
this can happen: zero, one, or two heads.  The probability of fewer
than three, then, is the sum of the probabilities of these results,
1/16 + 4/16 + 6/16 = 11/16 = 0.6875, or a little more than two out of
three.  So to calculate the probability of one outcome or another, sum the probabilities.  To get probability of one result and another from two
separate experiments, multiply the individual
probabilities.  The probability of getting one head in four flips is
4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25.  What's the probability of getting one head in each
of two successive sets of four flips?  Well, it's just 1/4 × 1/4 =
1/16 = 0.0625.  The probability for any number of heads x in
any number of flips n is thus:     the number of ways in which x heads can occur
in n flips, divided by the number of different possible
results of the series of flips, measured by number of heads.
But there's no need to sum the combinations in the denominator,
since the number of possible results is simply two raised
to the power of the number of flips.  So, we can simplify
the expression for the probability to:     More Flips  Let's see how the probability behaves as we make more and more flips.
Since we have a general formula for calculating the probability for
any number of heads in any number of flips, we can graph of the
probability for various numbers of flips.   8 Flips  16 Flips  32 Flips  64 Flips  128 Flips   In every case, the peak probability is at half the number of flips and
declines on both sides, more steeply as the number of flips increases.
This is the simple consequence of there being many more possible ways
for results close to half heads and tails to occur than ways that
result in a substantial majority of heads or tails.
The RPKP experiments involve a sequence of 1024
random bits, in which the most probable results form a narrow
curve centred at 512.  A document giving
probabilities for results of 1024 bit experiments with
chance expectations greater than one in 100 thousand million
runs is available , as is a much
larger table listing probabilities for
all possible results .  (The latter document is more than 150K bytes
and will take a while to download, and contains a very large
table which some Web browsers, particularly on machines with
limited memory, may not display properly.)  Perfectly Normal  As we make more and more flips, the graph of the probability of a
given number of heads becomes smoother and approaches the
“bell curve”, or normal distribution , as a limit.  The
normal distribution gives the probability for x heads
in n flips as:     where μ= n /2 and
σ is the standard deviation , a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for equal probability coin flipping, is:     We keep the standard deviation separate, as opposed to merging it into
the normal distribution probability equation, because it will play an
important rôle in interpreting the results of our experiments.  To
show how closely the probability chart approaches the normal
distribution even for a relatively small number of flips, here's the
normal distribution plotted in red, with the actual probabilities for
number of heads in 128 flips shown as blue bars.     The probability the outcome of an experiment with
a sufficiently large number of trials is due to
chance can be calculated directly from the result, and
the mean and standard deviation for the number of trials
in the experiment.  For additional details, including an
interactive probability calculator, please visit
the z Score
Probability Calculator .  Calculation and Reality  This is all very persuasive, you might say, and the formulas are
suitably intimidating, but does the real world actually behave this
way?  Well, as a matter of fact, it does, as we can see from a simple
experiment.  Get a coin, flip it 32 times, and write down the number
of times heads came up.  Now repeat the experiment fifty thousand
times.  When you're done, make a graph of the number of 32-flip sets
which resulted in a given number of heads.  Hmmmm…32 times
50,000 is 1.6 million, so if you flip the coin once a second,
twenty-four hours per day, it'll take eighteen and a half days to
complete the experiment….  Instead of marathon coin-flipping, let's use the same HotBits hardware random number generator our
experiments employ.  It's a simple matter of programming to withdraw
1.6 million bits from the generator, divide them up into 50,000 sets
of 32 bits each, then compute a histogram of the number of sets
containing each possible number of one bits (heads).  The results from
this experiment are presented in the following graph.     The red curve is the number of runs expected to result in each value
of heads, which is simply the probability of that number of heads
multiplied by the total number of experimental runs, 50,000.  The blue
diamonds are the actual number of 32 bit sets observed to contain each
number of one bits.  It is evident that the experimental results
closely match the expectation from probability.  Just as the
probability curve approaches the normal distribution for large numbers
of runs, experimental results from a truly random source will
inexorably converge on the predictions of probability as the number of
runs increases.   If
your Web browser supports Java applets, our Probability Pipe
Organ lets you run interactive experiments which demonstrate how
the results from random data approach the normal
curve expectation as the number of experiments grows large.   Experiments and Expectations  Performing an experiment amounts to asking the Universe a
question.  For the answer, the experimental results, to be
of any use, you have to be absolutely sure you've phrased the
question correctly.  When searching for elusive effects
among a sea of random events by statistical means, whether
in particle physics or parapsychology, one must take care
to apply statistics properly to the events being studied.
Misinterpreting genuine experimental results yields errors
just as serious as those due to faults in the design of the
experiment.  Evidence for the existence of a phenomenon must be significant , persistent , and consistent .
Statistical analysis can never entirely rule out the
possibility that the results of an experiment were entirely due to
chance—it can only calculate the probability of occurrence by
chance.  Only as more and more experiments are performed, which
reproduce the supposed effect and, by doing so, further decrease the
probability of chance, does the evidence for the effect become
persuasive.  To show how essential it is to ask the right question, consider an
experiment in which the subject attempts to influence a device which
generates random digits from 0 to 9 so that more nines are generated
than expected by chance.  Each experiment involves generation of one
thousand random digits.  We run the first experiment and get the
following result:   51866599999944246273322297520235159670265786865762

(we'll see how to calculate this numerically before long).
There was an excess of nines over the chance expectation, 100,
but greater excesses occurred for the digits 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .  But take a look at the first line of
the results!  518665 999999 44246273322297520235159670265786865762
                            .
                            .
                            .  These digits were supposed to be random , yet in the first
thousand, the first dozen for that matter, we found a pattern as
striking as “999999”.  What's the probability of that happening?  Just
the number of possible numbers of d digits which contain one
or more sequences of p or more consecutive nines:     Plugging in 1000 for d and 6 for p yields:     So the probability of finding “999999” in a set of 1000 random digits
is less than one in a thousand!  So then, are the digits not random,
after all?  Might our subject, while failing to influence the outcome
of the experiment in the way we've requested, have somehow marked the
results with a signature of a thousand-to-one probability of appearing
by chance?  Or have we simply asked the wrong question and gotten a
perfectly accurate answer that doesn't mean what we think it does at
first glance?  The latter turns out to be the case.  The data are right before our
eyes, and the probability we calculated is correct, but we asked
the wrong question , and in doing so fell into a trap littered
with the bones of many a naïve researcher.  Note the order in which we
did things.  We ran the experiment, examined the data, found something
seemingly odd in it, then calculated the probability of that
particular oddity appearing by chance.  We asked the question,
“ What is the probability of ‘999999’ appearing in a 1000 digit
random sequence? ” and got the answer “less than one in a
thousand”, a result most people would consider significant.  But since
we calculated the probability after seeing the data, in fact we were
asking the question “ What is the chance that ‘999999’ appears in a
1000 digit random sequence which contains one occurrence of
‘999999’?” .  The answer to that question is, of course,
“certainty”.  In the original examination of the data, we were really asking
“ What is the probability we'll find some striking sequence
of six digits in a random 1000 digit number? ”.  We can't
precisely quantify that without defining what “striking” means to the
observer, but it is clearly quite high.  Consider that I could have
made the case just as strongly for “000000”, “777777” or any other
six-digit repeat.  That alone reduces the probability of occurrence by
chance to one in ten.  Or, perhaps I might have pointed out a run of
digits like “123456”, “012345”, “987654”, and so on; or the first five
or six digits of a mathematical constant such as Pi, e, or the square
root of two; regular patterns like “101010”, “123321”, or a multitude
of others; or maybe my telephone or license plate number, or the
subject's!  It is, in fact, very likely you'll find some pattern you consider striking in a random 1000-digit number.  But, of course, if you don't examine the data from an experiment, how
are you going to notice if there's something odd about it?  Now we'll
see how a hypothesis is framed, tested by a series of experiments, and
confirmed or rejected by statistical analysis of the results.  So,
let's pursue this a bit further, exploring how we frame a hypothesis
based on an observation, run experiments to test it, and then analyse the
results to determine whether they confirm or
deny the hypothesis, and to what degree of certainty.  Our observation, based on examining the first thousand random digits,
is that “999999” appears once, while the probability of “999999”
appearing in a randomly chosen 1000 digit number is less than one in a
thousand.  Based on this observation we then suggest:    Hypothesis:  The sequence “999999” appears more frequently
in 1000-digit sequences with the subject attempting to influence
the generator than would be expected by chance.    We can now proceed to test this experimentally.  If the sequence
“999999” has a probability of occurring in a 1000 digit sequence of
0.000995, then for a thousand consecutive 1000 digit sequences (a
million digits in all), the probability of “999999” appearing will
be 0.995, almost unity. (To be correct, it's important
to test each 1000 digit sequence separately, then sum the results for
1000 consecutive sequences.  If we were to scan all million digits as
one sequence, we would count cases where the sequence “999999” begins
in one 1000 digit sequence and ends in the next.  The probability
(which you can calculate from the equation above) of finding “999999”
in a million digit sequence is 0.999995, somewhat higher than the
0.995 with the million digits are treated as separate 1000 digit
experiments.)   We will perform, then, the following experiment.  With our
ever-patient subject continuing to attempt to influence the output of the
generator, we will produce a million more sequences
of 1000 digits and, in each, count occurrences of “999999”.  Every
1000 sequences, we'll record the number of occurrences,
repeating the process until we've generated a thousand
runs of a million digits—10 9 digits in all.
With that data in hand, we'll see whether the “999999 effect”
is genuine or a fluke attributable to chance.  Here is a plot of the number of occurrences of the sequence “999999”
per block of 1000 digits over the thousand repetitions of the thousand
sequence experiment.  The number of occurrences expected by chance,
0.995, is marked by the green line.     At the outset, the results diverged substantially from chance, as is
frequently the case for small sample sizes.  But as the number of
experiments increased, the results converged toward the chance
expectation, ending up in a decreasing magnitude random walk around
it.  This is precisely what is expected from probability theory, and
hence we conclude no “999999 effect” exists.  Ensembles of Experiments: the X ² (Chi-Square) Test  So far, we've seen how the laws of probability predict the outcome of
large numbers of experiments involving random data, how to calculate
the probability of a given experimental result being due to chance,
and how one goes about framing a hypothesis, then designing and
running a series of experiments to test it.  Now it's time to examine
how to analyse the results from the experiments to determine whether
they provide evidence for the hypothesis and, if so, how much.  Since its introduction in 1900 by Karl Peterson, the chi-square
( X ²) test has become the most widely used measure of the
significance to which experimental results support or refute a
hypothesis.  Applicable to any experiment where discrete results can
be measured, it is used in almost every field of science.  The
chi-square test is the final step in a process which usually proceeds
as follows.   Based either on theory or examination of empirical
        data, a phenomenon is suggested to exist.  A hypothesis is framed incorporating the supposed
        phenomenon.  An experiment is designed to test the hypothesis.
        The experiment must produce results which differ
        based on the validity of the hypothesis.  The
        results of the experiment for the hypothesis-false
        ( null hypothesis ) case are calculated and,
        if appropriate, verified by a control experiment
        in which the hypothesised effect is excluded.  A series of experiments are conducted, and the
        results tabulated.  The chi-square test is applied to determine the
        significance of the discrepancy between the
        calculated null hypothesis case and the
        experimental results, and the probability that
        the discrepancy is the result of chance.  If
        that probability is very low, the experiment
        provides evidence for the hypothesis.   No experiment or series of experiments can ever prove a
hypothesis; one can only rule out other hypotheses and provide
evidence that assuming the truth of the hypothesis better explains the
experimental results than discarding it.  In many fields of science,
the task of estimating the null-hypothesis results can be formidable,
and can lead to prolonged and intricate arguments about the
assumptions involved.  Experiments must be carefully designed to
exclude selection effects which might bias the data.  Fortunately, retropsychokinesis experiments have an easily stated and
readily calculated null hypothesis: “The results will obey the
statistics for a sequence of random bits.” The fact that the data are
prerecorded guarantees (assuming the experiment software is properly
implemented and the results are presented without selection or
modification) that run selection or other forms of cheating cannot
occur.  (Anybody can score better than chance at coin flipping if
they're allowed to throw away experiments that come out poorly!)
Finally, the availability of all the programs in source code form and
the ability of others to repeat the experiments on their own premises
will allow independent confirmation of the results obtained here.  So, as the final step in analysing the results of a collection of n experiments, each with k possible outcomes, we
apply the chi-square test to compare the actual results with the
results expected by chance, which are just, for each outcome, its
probability times the number of experiments n .  Mathematically,
the chi-square statistic for an experiment with k possible outcomes, performed n times, in which Y 1 , Y 2 ,… Y k are the number of
experiments which resulted in each possible outcome, where the
probabilities of each outcome are p 1 ,
p 2 ,… p k is:     It's evident from examining this equation that the closer the
measured values are to those expected, the
lower the chi-square sum will be.  Further, from a chi-square
sum, the probability Q that the X ² sum for an experiment with d degrees of freedom (where d = k −1, one less
the number of possible outcomes) is consistent with the
null hypothesis can be calculated as:     Where Γ is the generalisation of the factorial
function to real and complex arguments:     Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for Q , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  If your Web browser supports

Calculator to calculate the probability from a chi-square value
and number of possible outcomes, or calculate the chi-square from the
probability and the number of possible outcomes.  In applying the chi-square test, it's essential to understand that only
very small probabilities of the null hypothesis are significant.
If the probability that the null hypothesis can explain the experimental
results is above 1%, an experiment is generally not considered evidence
of a different hypothesis.  The chi-square test takes
into account neither the number of experiments performed nor the
probability distribution of the expected outcomes; it is valid
only as the number of experiments becomes large, resulting in
substantial numbers for the most probable results.  If a hypothesis
is valid, the chi-square probability should converge on a
small value as more and more experiments are run.  Now let's examine an example of how the chi-square test identifies
experimental results which support or refute a hypothesis.  Our
simulated experiment consists of 50,000 runs of 32 random bits each.
The subject attempts to influence the random number generator to emit
an excess of one or zero bits compared to the chance expectation of
equal numbers of zeroes and ones.  The following table gives the
result of a control run using the random number generator without the
subject's attempting to influence it.  Even if the probability of
various outcomes is easily calculated, it's important to run control
experiments to make sure there are no errors in the experimental
protocol or apparatus which might bias the results away from those
expected.  The table below gives, for each possible number of one
bits, the number of runs which resulted in that count, the expectation
from probability, and the corresponding term in the chi-square sum.
The chi-square sum for the experiment is given at the bottom.

(32, one less than the 33 possible outcomes of the experiment)
into the Chi-Square Calculator gives a probability of 0.85.  This falls within the “fat region” of the
probability curve, and thus supports the null hypothesis, just as we
expected.  Next, we invite our subject to attempt to influence the random output
of our generator.  How? Hypotheses non
fingo. Let's just presume that by some means: telekinesis,
voodoo, tampering with the apparatus when we weren't
looking—whatever, our subject is able to bias the generator so
that out of every 200 bits there's an average of 101 one bits and 99
zeroes.  This seemingly subtle bias would result in an experiment like
the following.

terribly obvious divergence from the expectation, yet the chi-square
test unambiguously fingers the bias.  A X ² sum of 89.6775 in
an experiment with 33 possible outcomes (32 degrees of freedom)
has a probability of occurring by chance of 0.00000022—about
two in ten million—a highly significant result, worthy of
follow-up experiments and investigation of possible mechanisms which
might explain the deviation from chance.

New study shows how guessing heads or tails isn't really a 50-50 game  By Daily Mail Reporter    Published: 12:59 EDT, 2 December 2012 |  Updated: 13:00 EDT, 2 December 2012  [headerlinks  You don’t need to be a mathematician or a Vegas card shark to know that, when all things are equal, the probability of flipping a coin and guessing which side lands up correctly is 50-50. But what most people seem to forget, or so says Stanford math professor Persi Diaconis, is that things are almost never equal. In reality, the odds of guessing heads or tails correctly aren’t as even as you might think, and the reason has much more to do with physics than probability. According to Diaconis, a natural bias
 
occurs when coins are flipped, which results in the side that was 
originally facing up returning to that same position 51 per cent of the 
time. This means that if a coin is flipped with its heads side facing up, it will land the same way 51 out of 100 times.       Beating the Odds: Stanford professor Persi Diaconis, pictured, has determined that a flipped coin is more likely to end up facing the same direction as when it was first tossed than not.  Diaconis came to this conclusion after determining that no matter how hard a coin is flipped, the side that started up will spend more time facing up most of the time.  One way of thinking about this, as 
noted in an article from Coding Wheel, is to look at the ratio of even 
and odd numbers starting from one. What you'll discover is that no 
matter what number you stop at, there will never be more even numbers 
than odd numbers in that sequence.    RELATED ARTICLES   Previous  1  Next        Strong sense of smell is the key to a happy and lasting...

Share this article  Share     The coin flips work in much the same way.  Diaconis first realized that coin flips were not random after he and his colleagues managed to rig a coin-flipping machine to get a coin to land heads every time.      Making a Bet: Specifically, a coin will land with its initial face up 51 per cent of the time. He and his team then asked humans subjects do the same thing over and over, recording the results with a high speed camera. Though the results were a little more random, they still ended up with the 51-49 per cent margin. Diaconis noted that the randomness is attributed to the fact that when humans flip coins, there are a number of different motions the coin is likely to make. For instance, he showed how coins don’t 
just move end to end, but also in a circular motion, like a tossed 
pizza. He
 also found that there are ways to flip a coin where it looks like it is
 tumbling in the air, but in reality, it doesn’t move at all. Diaconis 
proved this by tying a ribbon to a coin and showing how in four of 10 
cases the ribbon would remain flat after the coin was caught. Still in the long run, his theory still held to be true. And while the 
margin is relatively small, it’s enough to maybe get you reconsidering 
using a coin toss to settle your next argument. In another startling discover, Diaconis determined that the probability of guessing which side comes up of a spinning penny is also skewed more in one direction. According to Diaconis’ research, a spinning penny will land tails side up roughly 80 per cent of the time. This is because the heads side of the penny, the one with the portrait of Abraham Lincoln on it, is slightly heavier than the tail side., This causes the coin’s center of mass to lie more toward the head side than the tail. So when it is spun, the penny will naturally fall toward its heavier size, which means there is considerably higher chance that it will land with the tail side up. Diaconis did warn that an older penny may pick up dirt and oils over times that could sway the direction it lands in one way or another, but a relatively new coin should land tails side up more. A magician in his spare time, Diaconis is well known for his work with probability. He was famous for discovering that it requires either five of seven shuffles, depending on the criteria, to get a deck of cards into a mathematically random order. Diaconis said that his next step is figuring out what effects randomizing factors, like letting a flipped coin drop first, affects his latest theory.

For example, suppose we have three coins.   Suppose:   the 1st coin has probability \( p_H\) of landing heads up and \( p_T\) of landing tails up;  the 2nd coin has probability \( q_H\) of landing heads up and \( q_T\) of landing tails up;  the 3rd coin has probability \( r_H\) of landing heads up and \( r_T\) of landing tails up.   Suppose we flip all of these coins: the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  What's the probability that we get this sequence of results: \( (H, T, T)\) If the coin flips are independent , the probability is just this product: \( p_H \, q_T \, r_T \) See the pattern?  We just multiply the probabilities.  And there's nothing special about coins here, or the number three . We could flip a coin, roll a die, pick a card, and see if it's raining outside. For example, what's the probability that we get heads with our coin, the number 6 on our die, an ace of spades with our cards, and it's raining? If these outcomes are independent , we just calculate: the probability that we get heads, times
the probability that we roll a 6, times
the probability that we get an ace of spades, times
the probability that it's raining outside. Let's solve some puzzles using this idea! Three flips of a fair coin Example 1. Suppose you have a fair coin: this means it has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up.  Suppose you flip it three times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up, then tails up, then heads up? We're asking about the probability of this outcome: \( (H, T, H)\) Since the flips are independent this is \( p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H \, p_T \, p_H \) Since the coin is fair we have \( \displaystyle{ p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2} } \) so \(  \displaystyle{ p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} } \) So the answer is 1/8, or 12.5%. Example 2. In the same situation, what's the probability that the coin lands heads up exactly twice? There are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 outcomes that can happen: \( (H,H,H) \)
\( (H,H,T), \; (H,T,H), \; (T,H,H) \)
\( (H,T,T), \; (T,H,T), \; (T,T,H) \)
\( (T,T,T) \) We can work out the probability of each of these outcomes.  For example, we've already seen that \( (H,T,H)\) is \( \displaystyle{ p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{8} }\) since the coin is fair and the flips are independent.  In fact, all 8 probabilities work out the same way.  We always get 1/8.  In other words, each of the 8 outcomes is equally likely! But we're interested in the probability that we get exactly two heads.  That's the probability of this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) Using the rule we saw in Part 7 , this probability is \( \displaystyle{ p(S) = p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) So the answer is 3/8, or 37.5%. I could have done this a lot faster.  I could say "there are 8 outcomes that can happen, each equally likely, and three that give us two heads, so the probability is 3/8."   But I wanted to show you how we're just following rules we've already seen! Three flips of a very unfair coin Example 3. Now suppose we have an unfair coin with a 90% chance of landing heads up and 10% chance of landing tails up!  What's the probability that if we flip it three times, it lands heads up exactly twice?  Again let's assume the coin flips are independent. Most of the calculation works exactly the same way, but now our coin has \( \displaystyle{ p_H = 0.9, \quad p_T = 0.1 } \) We're interested in the outcomes where the coin comes up heads twice, so we look at this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) The probability of this subset is \( \begin{array}{ccl} p(S) &=& p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} \\  &=& p_T \, p_H  \, p_H + p_H \, p_T \, p_H + p_H \, p_H \, p_T \\ &=& 3 p_T p_H^2 \\ &=& 3 \times 0.1 \times 0.9^2 \\ &=& 0.3 \times 0.81 \\ &=& 0.243 \end{array}\) So now the probability is just 24.3%. Six flips of a fair coin Example 4. Suppose you have a fair coin.  Suppose you flip it six times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up exactly twice? We did a similar problem already, where we flipped the coin three times.  Go back and look at that if you forget!  The answer to that problem was \( \displaystyle{ 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) Why?  Here's why: there were 3 ways to get two heads when you flipped 3 coins, and each of these outcomes had probability \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} }\) We can do our new problem the same way.  Count the number of ways to get two heads when we flip six coins.  Then multiply this by \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} }\) The hard part is to count how many ways we can get two heads when we flip six coins.  To get good at probabilities, we have to get good at counting.  It's boring to list all the outcomes we're trying to count: (H,H,T,T,T,T), (H,T,H,T,T,T), (H,T,T,H,T,T), ... So let's try to come up with a better idea. We have to pick 2 out of our 6 flips to be H's.  How many ways are there to do this? There are 6 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, and then 5 ways left over to pick another and draw a blue H on it... letting the rest be T's.  For example: (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, we've got 6 × 5 = 30 choices.  But we don't really care which H is red and which H is blue—that's just a trick to help us solve the problem.  For example, we don't want to count (T, H , T, T, H , T) as different from (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, there aren't really 30 ways to get two heads.  There are only half as many!  There are 15 ways. So, the probability of getting two heads when we flip the coin six times is \( \displaystyle{ 15 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{15}{64} \approx .234 } \) where the squiggle means 'approximately'.  So: about 23.4%. Binomial coefficients Now for some jargon, which will help when we do harder problems like this.  We say there are 6 choose 2 ways to choose 2 out of 6 things, and we write this as \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2} } \) This sort of number is called a binomial coefficient . We've just shown that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2}  = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 }\) Why write it like this funky fraction: \( \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}\)?  Because it'll help us see the pattern for doing harder problems like this! Nine flips of a fair coin If we flip a fair coin 9 times, and the flips are independent, what's the probability that we get heads exactly 6 times? This works just like the last problem, only the numbers are bigger.  So, I'll do it faster! When we flip the coin 9 times there are \( 2^9\) possible outcomes that can happen.   Each of these is equally likely if it's a fair coin and the flips are independent.  So each has probability \( \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{2^9} } \) To get the answer, we need to multiply this by the number of ways we can get heads exactly 6 times.  This number is called '9 choose 6' or \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6}  }\) for short.  It's the number of ways we can choose 6 things out of a collection of 9. So we just need to know: what's 9 choose 6?  We can work this out as before.  There are 9 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, then 8 ways left to pick another and draw a blue H on it, and 7 ways left to pick a third and draw a orange H on it.  That sounds like 9 × 8 × 7. But we've overcounted!   After all, we don't care about the colors.  We don't care about the difference between this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) and this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) In fact we've counted each possibility 6 times!  Why six?   The first H could be red, green or blue — that's 3 choices.  But then the second H could be either of the two remaining 2 colors... and for the third, we just have 1 choice.  So there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to permute the colors. So, the actual number of ways to get 6 heads out of 9 coin flips is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) In other words: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) To get the answer to our actual problem, remember we need to multiply \( 1/2^9\) by this.  So the answer is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6} }\) If you're a pure mathematician, you can say you're done now.  But normal people won't understand this answer, so let's calculate it out.  I hope you know the first ten powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.  So: \( \displaystyle{ 2^9 = 512 }\) I hope you can also do basic arithmetic like this: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84} \) So, the probability of getting 6 heads when you do 9 independent flips of a fair coin is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6}  = \frac{84}{512} = 0.164025 } \) or 16.4025%. I broke down and used a calculator at the last step.   We're becoming serious nerds here. Okay, that's enough for now.  We've been counting how many ways we can get a certain number of heads from a certain number of coin flips.  What we're realy doing is taking a set of coin flips, say \( n\) of them, and choosing a subset of \( k\) of them to be heads.  So, we say Definition. The binomial coefficient  \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} } \) called \( n\) choose \( k,\) is the number of ways of choosing a subset of \( k\) things from a set of \( n\) things. We have seen in some examples that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1} } \) Here there's a product of \( k\) consecutive numbers on top, and \( k\) on bottom too.  We didn't prove this is true in general, but it's not hard to see, using the tricks we've used already.

Sunday, March 29, 2009  Have you ever flipped a coin as a way of deciding something with another person? The answer is probably yes. And you probably did so assuming you were getting a fair deal, because, as everybody knows, a coin is equally likely to show heads or tails after a single flip—unless it's been shaved or weighted or has a week-old smear of coffee on its underbelly.   So when your friend places a coin on his thumb and says "call it in the air", you realize that it doesn't really matter whether you pick heads or tails. Every person has a preference, of course—heads or tails might feel "luckier" to you—but logically the chances are equal.  Or are they?   Granted, everybody knows that newly-minted coins are born with tiny imperfections, minute deviations introduced by the fabrication process. Everybody knows that, over time, a coin will wear and tear, picking up scratches, dings, dents, bacteria, and finger-grease. And everybody knows that these imperfections can affect the physics of the coin flip, biasing the results by some infinitesimal amount which in practice we ignore.  But let's assume that's not the case.  Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer . And, since it's possible to train one's thumb to flip a coin such that it comes up heads or tails a huge percentage of the time, let's assume the person flipping the coin isn't a magician or a prestidigitator. In other words, let's assume both a perfect coin and an honest toss, such as the kind you might make with a friend to decide who pays for lunch.  In that case there's an absolute right and wrong answer to the age-old question...  Heads or tails?  ...because the two outcomes of a typical coin flip are not equally likely.  The 50-50 proposition is actually more of a 51-49 proposition, if not worse. The sacred coin flip exhibits (at minimum) a whopping 1% bias , and possibly much more. 1% may not sound like a lot, but it's more than the typical casino edge in a game of blackjack or slots. What's more, you can take advantage of this little-known fact to give yourself an edge in all future coin-flip battles.  The Physics of Coin Flipping  In the 31-page Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss , Persi Diaconis, Susan Holmes, and Richard Montgomery lay out the theory and practice of coin-flipping to a degree that's just, well, downright intimidating.   Suffice to say their approach involved a lot of physics, a lot of math, motion-capture cameras, random experimentation, and an automated "coin-flipper" device capable of flipping a coin and producing Heads 100% of the time.   Here are the broad strokes of their research:   If the coin is tossed and caught , it has about a 51% chance of landing on the same face it was launched. (If it starts out as heads, there's a 51% chance it will end as heads).  If the coin is spun, rather than tossed , it can have a much-larger-than-50% chance of ending with the heavier side down. Spun coins can exhibit "huge bias" (some spun coins will fall tails-up 80% of the time).  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor , this probably adds randomness.  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor where it spins , as will sometimes happen, the above spinning bias probably comes into play.  A coin will land on its edge around 1 in 6000 throws , creating a flipistic singularity .  The same initial coin-flipping conditions produce the same coin flip result . That is, there's a certain amount of determinism to the coin flip.  A more robust coin toss (more revolutions) decreases the bias .   The 51% figure in Premise 1 is a bit curious and, when I first saw it, I assumed it was a minor bias introduced by the fact that the "heads" side of the coin has more decoration than the "tails" side, making it heavier. But it turns out that this sort of imbalance has virtually no effect unless you spin the coin on its edge, in which case you'll see a huge bias. The reason a typical coin toss is 51-49 and not 50-50 has nothing to do with the asymmetry of the coin and everything to do with the aggregate amount of time the coin spends in each state, as it flips through space.  A good way of thinking about this is by looking at the ratio of odd numbers to even numbers when you start counting from 1.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  No matter how long you count, you'll find that at any given point, one of two things will be true:   You've touched more odd numbers than even numbers  You've touched an equal amount of odd numbers and even numbers   What will never happen, is this:   You've touched more even numbers than odd numbers.   Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether:  H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Heads state. In the aggregate, it's slightly more likely that the coin shows Heads at a given point in time—including whatever time the coin is caught. And vice-versa if you start the coin-flip from the Tails position.  The Strategy of Coin Flipping  Unlike the article on the edge in a game of blackjack mentioned previously, I've never seen a description of "coin flipping strategy" which takes the above science into count. When it's a true 50-50 toss, there is no strategy. But if we take it as granted, or at least possible, that a coin flip does indeed exhibit a 1% or more bias, then the following rules of thumb might apply.   Always be the chooser, if possible . This allows you to leverage Premise 1 or Premise 2 for those extra percentage points.  Always be the tosser , if you can. This protects you from virtuoso coin-flippers who are able to leverage Premise 6 to produce a desired outcome. It also protects you against the added randomness (read: fairness) introduced by flippers who will occasionally, without rhyme or reason, invert the coin in their palm before revealing. Tricksy Hobbitses.  Don't allow the same person to both toss and choose . Unless, of course, that person is you.  If the coin is being tossed, and you're the chooser, always choose the side that's initially face down . According to Premise 1, you'd always choose the side that's initially face up, but most people, upon flipping a coin, will invert it into their other palm before revealing. Hence, you choose the opposite side, but you get the same 1% advantage. Of course, if you happen to know that a particular flipper doesn't do this, use your better judgment.  If you are the tosser but not the chooser, sometimes invert the coin into your other palm after catching, and sometimes don't . This protects you against people who follow Rule 4 blindly by assuming you'll either invert the coin or you won't.  If the coin is being spun rather than tossed , always choose whichever side is lightest . On a typical coin, the "Heads" side of the coin will have more "stuff" engraved on it, causing Tails to show up more frequently than it should. Choosing Tails in this situation is usually the power play.  Never under any circumstances agree to a coin spin if you're not the chooser . This opens you up to a devastating attack if your opponent is aware of Premise 2.   I hope I've made it clear that none of this is really to be taken seriously. The point is that adding even 1% of wobble to a situation of pure chance can create a lot of additional complexity, and that in turn, can create strategy where none existed before.

I would add to your "coin flip strategy" that if you suspect you're facing a "virtuoso tosser" and he won't let you do the toss, make him toss it on the ground.  Cheers.   Heads I Win Tails You Lose on Sunday, March 29, 2009   Lol. Interesting.  I may be mistaken here, but I believe your term "one vigintillionth of a yoctometer" is below the Plank length, making it so small as to be meaningless. Been a while since I looked at this stuff (college in fact) but...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length   Anonymous Coward on Sunday, March 29, 2009   that's the point.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, October 17, 2011   Awesome article. Really enjoyed reading it and having a break from the indepth computer science. Thanks.   Poker Forums on Monday, March 30, 2009   One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should atleast adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.  Jokes aside, nice article. For a moment, I was thinking that, even given your explanation of the inherent bias, it doesn't make sense since the coin would never land in the position it started at without flipping, as that would really be an invalid flip. But then, I guess all you do is move the minimum number of flips ahead to 2 or 3, and the state of the coin there is your new "initial" state, and you can set up the same argument. Nice.  However, I wonder what the case would be if one started the coin at a half-flip, on its edge? You might say that the initial face would correspond to the next face to show up after it performs a half-flip. But instead of a half-flip, what if you had just behind a half-flip? What about a quarter flip? I don't know a good line of reasoning to take care of these cases, it almost seems arbitrary.  And of course, it's totally pointless too. But who cares, interesting nonetheless!   ehsanul on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   [i]>One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail!

But more memorable than "down to the last molecule/nanometer/etc". I got the idea for the phrase from Neal Stephenson's book in which the villain has a knife with an edge "one molecule wide".  If you managed to flip the coin from the edge position (let E represent the edge state):  E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H  I still think the sequence exhibits the clumping shown above, because the coin spends only a tiny fraction of its time in those E states (it's really only in E when it's perfectly vertical). Because the aggregate time in E is so small, the probabilities would still favor whatever state immediately followed the initial E state (in this case, heads). At least, it seems you could make the argument.   Coding the Wheel on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Another strategy. If not obvious:   If you are the tosser, and not the chooser, flip the coin into your palm after the toss only if they pick the face up side.    James R on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   You missed an important strategy.  I used to earn lunch money in high school thusly:
I could flip a coin to come out "heads" about 90% of the time (with practice, same as knife throwing, control # of flips through the air during a certain time between flip and catch).  Anyhow, I flip, you call while in the air.
I catch and you most always lose because after you call it in the air, I choose to catch, or catch and invert (your #5. above). You assume it was fair because you called it in the air. No one ever figured out what I was doing (or I would have been beaten up!).   Comfortable on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Persi Diaconis is also the guy who did the (often-misquoted) research into how many times you should shuffle a deck of cards.   bmm6o on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   So, to paraphrase Vizzini:  "But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the coin into his own hand or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the coin into his own hand, because he would know that only a great fool would request to make the call. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the side facing up. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the side facing down."  But we all know how Vizzini ended up. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha...   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Just found your blog and have read quite a few of your posts - excellent job.  I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however.  In fact the paper does show that a coin flipped without precession does have a 50/50 chance (even though your H T H T H T H argument would still apply).  But with precession the coin will spend a greater frequency of it's time in the starting position (in fact with enough precession it will appear to flip but be 100% in the up position - alas I can not seem to master that).  If you take a coin and manually flip it end over end while precessing it at the same time you can kind of visualize this.  In the case without precession it's irrelevant that it starts as heads or tails.  What's relevant is that after flipping the coin spends equal amounts of time in the air in both states.  Again with precession this is not true.  Apparently their experiments showed that a typical coin flip done by hand precesses enough to give the 1% bias.   Anonymous Coward on Saturday, April 04, 2009   How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?  Seems low to my thinking. BTW, happened to me, a long time ago over who buys the next pitcher of beer.  I never met anyone else who has seen a coin land on its edge.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, April 06, 2009   [i]>I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however. In fact the paper does show that[/i]  You're right. The entire argument is an oversimplification.  [i]>How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?[/i]  That figure was for a nickel and I think it would be less for other coins.

Coding the Wheel on Monday, April 06, 2009   A couple days ago I flipped a coin (nickel) and it landed, rolled, and stayed on edge. It was a new nickel and a flat (glass) table but it happened.  One of the more interesting "light reading" posts I've come across in weeks.   jzx on Wednesday, April 08, 2009   I'm neither a mathematician nor a physicist, having found my way here via the link from Freakonomics (I suppose I should say I'm not an economist either), but I think the HTHT analysis would lead to a conclusion opposite to the one given here.  If we assume that the coin is in fact flipped, and not simply "moved from Point A to Point B by a process that may or may not involve flipping," then isn't it correct to deem the initial state of a flipped coin as being 180 degrees revolved from its state in the flipper's hand? If so (and that seems right to me), the HTHT analysis leads to the conclusion that the side of the coin more likely to be up at the end of the flip is the side that was down in the flipper's hands.   DBH on Thursday, April 16, 2009   I would appreciate a strategy for Two-up
Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated 'Spinner' throwing two coins into the air. Traditionally, these coins are pennies. Incidentally, their weight size and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the 'kip' and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and they don't 'fly' so well. The design of pennies that date pre 1939 had the soveriegns head on the obverse(front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing making the result very easy and quick to see. Pennies can often be obseved being used at games on Anzac Day, they are and brought out specifically for the purpose each year.  Players gamble on whether the coins will fall with both (obverse) heads up, both (reverse) tails up, or with one coin a head, and one a tail (known as 'Odds'). It is traditionally played on ANZAC Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages.   Pablo Uribe on Monday, April 27, 2009   "Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer."  Its not. The research is highly biased based on the perfect flip and the coin not being a perfect coin.  On top of this, the coin may be flipped 500 million times showing a 51-49, but you could flip it 1 trillion times resulting in 50-50.  If I gave Sally half my meal, am I left with 49% or 50%? Yeah...  If anything, its more likely the coin has a 49.99999999....-49.9999999 probability, giving room for the randomness of variables like the blatant bias in this research.   Anonymous Coward on Friday, July 31, 2009   Impresive reasearch man...   John on Monday, August 03, 2009   The aggregate time hypothesis doesn't work. If you just shift the frame to the, say, third flip in the air - since it's highly unlikely that the coin will land before it's third flip - you'll get the same argument reversed. I.e., if I start with heads, let it flip 3 times with tails up, and then start counting aggregate time, I'll get a THTHTHTHT... pattern and tails will now win 51% of the time.   Nyet on Monday, August 24, 2009   I used to work with a guy who was sure that coins had memory.  To him if you had a fair coin and you flipped it 100 times and got heads the odds would be better that you would get a tail on the next flip.  No matter how I explained it to him he would not believe that it was still 50/50.  I asked him how the coin "remembered what it's last 100 flips were?"   Sitelinker on Monday, August 24, 2009   Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame!  "A weaker man might be moved to re-examine his faith, if in nothing else at least in the law of probability."  Fascinating piece, by the way.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm afraid that the HTHTH... argument appears to me to be completely bogus.  The only reason that there might be one more heads is that you decided to start counting on heads. Why did you start counting on heads? Because that was what was showing in the beginning, when it was resting on the thumb.  But you could equally argue that that is the very worst place to start counting. A coin flip isn't a coin flip if it doesn't leave the thumb. Indeed, it has to have at least one flip. Therefore, it is completely impossible that the first H would ever be counted.  So you could make an equally good argument saying  [quote]Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether. After the first flip, naturally, it will be on Tails:  T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Tails state.[/quote]  This argument sounds just as reasonable as the first one, if not more so, which implies to me that the whole argument doesn't work.  Note that if this [b]did[/b] make sense, then the coin would show a bias of much, much more than 51%, because the coin would have to flip at least 100 times before the effect of that "first side" bias, were it true, was as low as 1%. Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame![/i]  I thought long and hard about it. Seriously. Great movie.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjOqaD5tWB0#t=0m50  [i]>Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).
[/i]  Yes. Excellent points. The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate, not necessarily meant to be an accurate portrayal of the physics. For example, if you flip the coin for say 1.5 revolutions it's obviously not approximating 51-49. This was a device, but an innocent one.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate[/i]  Yes, but you do specifically say that the reason (according to you) that the coin spends more of its time on "Heads" is that there are more H's then T's in your sequence, and that this is because you started with "H."  Simplification or not, this is fundamentally a wrong way to look at it, as several people have said. The problem with your approach is that it all depends on where you start counting, and you can pick wherever you want depending on what you want to prove, which is not good physics. The article doesn't suggest your explanation.  Although the article doesn't appear to suggest any explanation, a better explanation of the idea that the coin spends more time on one face than the other "in aggregate" would be one where this really is displayed where ever you start counting from. For example, the following argument, though not necessarily true, displays this property:  [quote]"Due to the asymmetry of flipping, the coin spends more time in the 360 degree flipped position than the 180 degree flipped position. If we write out the sequence showing what face is showing at time T, with the dT between values being 0.01 s, it would look like  ....2211111122211111222111111222...  as you can see, it spends more time on the first face ("1") than the second, so is more likely to be caught when displaying the first face."[/quote]  This argument, while probably incorrect and not supported by the article, at least is an explanation that doesn't depend on whether you start counting when the coin being on your thumb or after the first flip.   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm surprised no one mentioned (or at least I didn't notice) the fair coin flip where it doesn't matter whether the coin is biased or not. It can be done in the following way:  Flip coin two times. If it ends up HT or TH, the result is the first one of the sequence. If it ends up HH or TT, continue flipping it again two times until you get HT or TH.  p(1-p) = (1-p)p   Stephen on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Agree with Stephen. Good idea!  Disagree with SamSam: the research clearly states the coin is biased based on where it starts.  Disagree with the author: it has nothing to do with aggregate time. The precession/wobbling of the coin around it's horizontal center of gravity is what creates the bias. At least that's my reading of the research.  You're all wrong.   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Very nice written, very clear and contains useful link to original research...only one problem with the above that seemed to me immediately clear:  there's no  empirical data supporting it's main conclusion of a 1% bias. Not even "my friend Jim and other graduate  students tossed a coin drawn from circulation ..." With a Ph.D in probability theory from Oxford I persisted and skimmed the origianl research (I have been developing my skimming skills by working on the redacted parts of the CIA's Inspector General's report - I have become most adept at getting through the large black blanks.) Low and behold I find in the original article on page 10 the staement that no empirical data has been found to support the hypothesis.  The coins studied have been gussied up like kids  going to a party... faces painted, ribbons attached etc. Without real experiments on mature coins (those drawn from circulation), the conclusions here seems highly questionable.

Starting on H and assuming a constant spin rate & time on one side = t, the ratio of time on each side would be H t, H t:T t, H 2t:T t, H 2t:T 2t, H 3t:T*2t,...  (that's 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:1, 3:2, 1:1, 4:3, 1:1, 5:4, 1:1, 6:5, 1:1, 7:6,...)

Greater only means greater = not less than or equal to.  While I think it was fair to say the odds increased. Quantifying the increase involved voodoo & was clearly used for illustrative purposes only.  Great article! A+  and Bruce sent me, too :-)   DoNoEvil on Thursday, October 15, 2009   Great article.

Well, in that case the probability of it ending up in a the state it started in would be  51% only if there were about 100 flips in the air.

Home | About | Contact | Subscribe  Copyright © 2011 | All Rights Reserved     Introduction to Probability and Statistics    Calculation and Chance  Most experimental searches for paranormal phenomena are statistical in
nature.  A subject repeatedly attempts a task with a known probability
of success due to chance, then the number of actual successes is compared
to the chance expectation.  If a subject scores consistently higher or
lower than the chance expectation after a large number of attempts,
one can calculate the probability of such a score due purely to
chance, and then argue, if the chance probability is sufficiently
small, that the results are evidence for the existence of some
mechanism (precognition, telepathy, psychokinesis, cheating, etc.)
which allowed the subject to perform better than chance would seem to
permit.  Suppose you ask a subject to guess, before it is flipped, whether a
coin will land with heads or tails up.  Assuming the coin is fair (has
the same probability of heads and tails), the chance of guessing
correctly is 50%, so you'd expect half the guesses to be correct and
half to be wrong.  So, if we ask the subject to guess heads or tails
for each of 100 coin flips, we'd expect about 50 of the guesses to be
correct.  Suppose a new subject walks into the lab and manages to
guess heads or tails correctly for 60 out of 100 tosses.  Evidence of
precognition, or perhaps the subject's possessing a telekinetic power
which causes the coin to land with the guessed face up?  Well,…no.
In all likelihood, we've observed nothing more than good luck.  The
probability of 60 correct guesses out of 100 is about 2.8%, which
means that if we do a large number of experiments flipping 100 coins,
about every 35 experiments we can expect a score of 60 or better,
purely due to chance.  But suppose this subject continues to guess about 60 right
out of a hundred, so that after ten runs of 100 tosses—1000
tosses in all, the subject has made 600 correct guesses.
The probability of that happening purely by chance is less
than one in seven billion, so it's time to start thinking
about explanations other than luck.  Still, improbable things
happen all the time: if you hit a golf ball, the odds it
will land on a given blade of grass are millions to one, yet
(unless it ends up in the lake or a sand trap) it is
certain to land on some blades of grass.  Finally, suppose this “dream subject” continues to guess 60%
of the flips correctly, observed by multiple video cameras,
under conditions prescribed by skeptics and debunkers, using
a coin provided and flipped by The Amazing Randi himself, with
a final tally of 1200 correct guesses in 2000 flips.  You'd
have to try the 2000 flips more than 5×10 18 times before you'd expect that result to occur by chance.
If it takes a day to do 2000 guesses and coin flips, it
would take more than 1.3×10 16 years of
2000 flips per day before you'd expect to see 1200 correct
guesses due to chance.  That's more than a million times
the age of the universe, so you'd better get started soon!  Claims of evidence for the paranormal are usually based upon
statistics which diverge so far from the expectation due to chance
that some other mechanism seems necessary to explain the experimental
results.  To interpret the results of our RetroPsychoKinesis
experiments, we'll be using the mathematics of probability and
statistics, so it's worth spending some time explaining how we go
about quantifying the consequences of chance.     Note to mathematicians: The following discussion of probability
is deliberately simplified to consider only binomial and normal distributions
with a probability of 0.5, the presumed probability of success in
the experiments in question.  I decided that
presenting and discussing the equations for arbitrary probability
would only decrease the probability that readers would persevere
and arrive at an understanding of the fundamentals of probability
theory.    Twelve and a half cents: one bit!  In slang harking back to the days of gold doubloons and pieces of
eight, the United States quarter-dollar coin is nicknamed “two bits”.
The Fourmilab radioactive random
number generator produces a stream of binary ones and zeroes, or bits .  Since we expect the generator to produce ones and
zeroes with equal probability, each bit from the generator is
equivalent to a coin flip: heads for one and tails for zero.  When we run
experiments with the generator, in effect, we're flipping a binary coin , one bit —twelve and a
half cents!     Two Bits    One Bit            Heads  Tails    Heads  Tails     (We could, of course, have called zero heads and one tails; since both
occur with equal probability, the choice is arbitrary.) Each bit
produced by the random number generator is a flip of our one-bit coin.
Now the key thing to keep in mind about a genuine random number
generator or flip of a fair coin is that it has no memory or,
as mathematicians say, each bit from the generator or flip is independent .  Even if, by chance, the coin has come up heads
ten times in a row, the probability of getting heads or tails on the
next flip is precisely equal.  Gamblers who've seen a coin come up
heads ten times in a row may believe “tails is way overdue”, but the
coin doesn't know and couldn't care less about the last ten flips; the
next flip is just as likely to be the eleventh head in a row as the
tail that breaks the streak.  Even though there is no way whatsoever to predict the outcome of the
next flip, if we flip a coin a number of times, the laws of
probability allow us to predict, with greater accuracy as the number
of flips increases, the probability of obtaining various results.  In
the discussion that follows, we'll ignore the order of the flips and
only count how many times the coin came up heads.  Since heads is one
and tails is zero, we can just add up the results from the flips, or
the bits from the random generator.  Four Flips  Suppose we flip a coin four times.  Since each flip can come up heads
or tails, there are 16 possible outcomes, tabulated below, grouped by
the number of heads in the four flips.     Number of Heads  Results of Flips  Number of Ways    0       1    1                       4    2                                 6    3                       4    4       1      Number of Ways summarises how many different ways the results
of the four flips could end up with a given number of heads.  Since
the only way to get zero heads is for all four flips to be tails,
there's only one way that can occur.  One head out of four flips can
happen four different ways since each of the four flips could have
been the head.  Two heads out of four flips can happen six different
ways, as tabulated.  And since what's true of heads applies equally to
tails, there are four ways to get three heads and one way to get four.  Mathematically, the number of ways to get x heads (or tails) in n flips is spoken of as
the “number of combinations of n things taken x at a time”, which is written as:     This, it turns out, can be calculated for any positive integers n and x whatsoever, as follows.     For example, if we plug in 4 for n and 2 for x ,
we get  4! / (2! (4 − 2)!) = 4! / (2! 2!) = 24 / (2 2) = 24 / 4 = 6  as expected.
Plotting the number of ways we can get different numbers of
heads yields the following graph.     Probability  Since the coin is fair, each flip has an equal chance of coming up
heads or tails, so all 16 possible outcomes tabulated above are
equally probable.  But since there are 6 ways to get 2 heads, in four
flips the probability of two heads is greater than that of
any other result.  We express probability as a number between 0 and 1.
A probability of zero is a result which cannot ever occur: the
probability of getting five heads in four flips is zero.  A
probability of one represents certainty: if you flip a coin, the
probability you'll get heads or tails is one (assuming it
can't land on the rim,  fall into a black hole, or some such).  The probability of getting a given number of heads from
four flips is, then, simply the number of ways that
number of heads can occur, divided by the number of total
results of four flips, 16.  We can then tabulate the
probabilities as follows.     Number of Heads  Number of Ways  Probability    0  1  1/16 = 0.0625    1  4  4/16 = 0.25    2  6  6/16 = 0.375    3  4  4/16 = 0.25    4  1  1/16 = 0.0625     Since we are absolutely certain the number of heads we get in four
flips is going to be between zero and four, the probabilities of the
different numbers of heads should add up to 1.  Summing the
probabilities in the table confirms this.  Further, we can calculate
the probability of any collection of results by adding the individual
probabilities of each.  Suppose we'd like to know the probability of
getting fewer than three heads from four flips.  There are three ways
this can happen: zero, one, or two heads.  The probability of fewer
than three, then, is the sum of the probabilities of these results,
1/16 + 4/16 + 6/16 = 11/16 = 0.6875, or a little more than two out of
three.  So to calculate the probability of one outcome or another, sum the probabilities.  To get probability of one result and another from two
separate experiments, multiply the individual
probabilities.  The probability of getting one head in four flips is
4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25.  What's the probability of getting one head in each
of two successive sets of four flips?  Well, it's just 1/4 × 1/4 =
1/16 = 0.0625.  The probability for any number of heads x in
any number of flips n is thus:     the number of ways in which x heads can occur
in n flips, divided by the number of different possible
results of the series of flips, measured by number of heads.
But there's no need to sum the combinations in the denominator,
since the number of possible results is simply two raised
to the power of the number of flips.  So, we can simplify
the expression for the probability to:     More Flips  Let's see how the probability behaves as we make more and more flips.
Since we have a general formula for calculating the probability for
any number of heads in any number of flips, we can graph of the
probability for various numbers of flips.   8 Flips  16 Flips  32 Flips  64 Flips  128 Flips   In every case, the peak probability is at half the number of flips and
declines on both sides, more steeply as the number of flips increases.
This is the simple consequence of there being many more possible ways
for results close to half heads and tails to occur than ways that
result in a substantial majority of heads or tails.
The RPKP experiments involve a sequence of 1024
random bits, in which the most probable results form a narrow
curve centred at 512.  A document giving
probabilities for results of 1024 bit experiments with
chance expectations greater than one in 100 thousand million
runs is available , as is a much
larger table listing probabilities for
all possible results .  (The latter document is more than 150K bytes
and will take a while to download, and contains a very large
table which some Web browsers, particularly on machines with
limited memory, may not display properly.)  Perfectly Normal  As we make more and more flips, the graph of the probability of a
given number of heads becomes smoother and approaches the
“bell curve”, or normal distribution , as a limit.  The
normal distribution gives the probability for x heads
in n flips as:     where μ= n /2 and
σ is the standard deviation , a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for equal probability coin flipping, is:     We keep the standard deviation separate, as opposed to merging it into
the normal distribution probability equation, because it will play an
important rôle in interpreting the results of our experiments.  To
show how closely the probability chart approaches the normal
distribution even for a relatively small number of flips, here's the
normal distribution plotted in red, with the actual probabilities for
number of heads in 128 flips shown as blue bars.     The probability the outcome of an experiment with
a sufficiently large number of trials is due to
chance can be calculated directly from the result, and
the mean and standard deviation for the number of trials
in the experiment.  For additional details, including an
interactive probability calculator, please visit
the z Score
Probability Calculator .  Calculation and Reality  This is all very persuasive, you might say, and the formulas are
suitably intimidating, but does the real world actually behave this
way?  Well, as a matter of fact, it does, as we can see from a simple
experiment.  Get a coin, flip it 32 times, and write down the number
of times heads came up.  Now repeat the experiment fifty thousand
times.  When you're done, make a graph of the number of 32-flip sets
which resulted in a given number of heads.  Hmmmm…32 times
50,000 is 1.6 million, so if you flip the coin once a second,
twenty-four hours per day, it'll take eighteen and a half days to
complete the experiment….  Instead of marathon coin-flipping, let's use the same HotBits hardware random number generator our
experiments employ.  It's a simple matter of programming to withdraw
1.6 million bits from the generator, divide them up into 50,000 sets
of 32 bits each, then compute a histogram of the number of sets
containing each possible number of one bits (heads).  The results from
this experiment are presented in the following graph.     The red curve is the number of runs expected to result in each value
of heads, which is simply the probability of that number of heads
multiplied by the total number of experimental runs, 50,000.  The blue
diamonds are the actual number of 32 bit sets observed to contain each
number of one bits.  It is evident that the experimental results
closely match the expectation from probability.  Just as the
probability curve approaches the normal distribution for large numbers
of runs, experimental results from a truly random source will
inexorably converge on the predictions of probability as the number of
runs increases.   If
your Web browser supports Java applets, our Probability Pipe
Organ lets you run interactive experiments which demonstrate how
the results from random data approach the normal
curve expectation as the number of experiments grows large.   Experiments and Expectations  Performing an experiment amounts to asking the Universe a
question.  For the answer, the experimental results, to be
of any use, you have to be absolutely sure you've phrased the
question correctly.  When searching for elusive effects
among a sea of random events by statistical means, whether
in particle physics or parapsychology, one must take care
to apply statistics properly to the events being studied.
Misinterpreting genuine experimental results yields errors
just as serious as those due to faults in the design of the
experiment.  Evidence for the existence of a phenomenon must be significant , persistent , and consistent .
Statistical analysis can never entirely rule out the
possibility that the results of an experiment were entirely due to
chance—it can only calculate the probability of occurrence by
chance.  Only as more and more experiments are performed, which
reproduce the supposed effect and, by doing so, further decrease the
probability of chance, does the evidence for the effect become
persuasive.  To show how essential it is to ask the right question, consider an
experiment in which the subject attempts to influence a device which
generates random digits from 0 to 9 so that more nines are generated
than expected by chance.  Each experiment involves generation of one
thousand random digits.  We run the first experiment and get the
following result:   51866599999944246273322297520235159670265786865762

(we'll see how to calculate this numerically before long).
There was an excess of nines over the chance expectation, 100,
but greater excesses occurred for the digits 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .  But take a look at the first line of
the results!  518665 999999 44246273322297520235159670265786865762
                            .
                            .
                            .  These digits were supposed to be random , yet in the first
thousand, the first dozen for that matter, we found a pattern as
striking as “999999”.  What's the probability of that happening?  Just
the number of possible numbers of d digits which contain one
or more sequences of p or more consecutive nines:     Plugging in 1000 for d and 6 for p yields:     So the probability of finding “999999” in a set of 1000 random digits
is less than one in a thousand!  So then, are the digits not random,
after all?  Might our subject, while failing to influence the outcome
of the experiment in the way we've requested, have somehow marked the
results with a signature of a thousand-to-one probability of appearing
by chance?  Or have we simply asked the wrong question and gotten a
perfectly accurate answer that doesn't mean what we think it does at
first glance?  The latter turns out to be the case.  The data are right before our
eyes, and the probability we calculated is correct, but we asked
the wrong question , and in doing so fell into a trap littered
with the bones of many a naïve researcher.  Note the order in which we
did things.  We ran the experiment, examined the data, found something
seemingly odd in it, then calculated the probability of that
particular oddity appearing by chance.  We asked the question,
“ What is the probability of ‘999999’ appearing in a 1000 digit
random sequence? ” and got the answer “less than one in a
thousand”, a result most people would consider significant.  But since
we calculated the probability after seeing the data, in fact we were
asking the question “ What is the chance that ‘999999’ appears in a
1000 digit random sequence which contains one occurrence of
‘999999’?” .  The answer to that question is, of course,
“certainty”.  In the original examination of the data, we were really asking
“ What is the probability we'll find some striking sequence
of six digits in a random 1000 digit number? ”.  We can't
precisely quantify that without defining what “striking” means to the
observer, but it is clearly quite high.  Consider that I could have
made the case just as strongly for “000000”, “777777” or any other
six-digit repeat.  That alone reduces the probability of occurrence by
chance to one in ten.  Or, perhaps I might have pointed out a run of
digits like “123456”, “012345”, “987654”, and so on; or the first five
or six digits of a mathematical constant such as Pi, e, or the square
root of two; regular patterns like “101010”, “123321”, or a multitude
of others; or maybe my telephone or license plate number, or the
subject's!  It is, in fact, very likely you'll find some pattern you consider striking in a random 1000-digit number.  But, of course, if you don't examine the data from an experiment, how
are you going to notice if there's something odd about it?  Now we'll
see how a hypothesis is framed, tested by a series of experiments, and
confirmed or rejected by statistical analysis of the results.  So,
let's pursue this a bit further, exploring how we frame a hypothesis
based on an observation, run experiments to test it, and then analyse the
results to determine whether they confirm or
deny the hypothesis, and to what degree of certainty.  Our observation, based on examining the first thousand random digits,
is that “999999” appears once, while the probability of “999999”
appearing in a randomly chosen 1000 digit number is less than one in a
thousand.  Based on this observation we then suggest:    Hypothesis:  The sequence “999999” appears more frequently
in 1000-digit sequences with the subject attempting to influence
the generator than would be expected by chance.    We can now proceed to test this experimentally.  If the sequence
“999999” has a probability of occurring in a 1000 digit sequence of
0.000995, then for a thousand consecutive 1000 digit sequences (a
million digits in all), the probability of “999999” appearing will
be 0.995, almost unity. (To be correct, it's important
to test each 1000 digit sequence separately, then sum the results for
1000 consecutive sequences.  If we were to scan all million digits as
one sequence, we would count cases where the sequence “999999” begins
in one 1000 digit sequence and ends in the next.  The probability
(which you can calculate from the equation above) of finding “999999”
in a million digit sequence is 0.999995, somewhat higher than the
0.995 with the million digits are treated as separate 1000 digit
experiments.)   We will perform, then, the following experiment.  With our
ever-patient subject continuing to attempt to influence the output of the
generator, we will produce a million more sequences
of 1000 digits and, in each, count occurrences of “999999”.  Every
1000 sequences, we'll record the number of occurrences,
repeating the process until we've generated a thousand
runs of a million digits—10 9 digits in all.
With that data in hand, we'll see whether the “999999 effect”
is genuine or a fluke attributable to chance.  Here is a plot of the number of occurrences of the sequence “999999”
per block of 1000 digits over the thousand repetitions of the thousand
sequence experiment.  The number of occurrences expected by chance,
0.995, is marked by the green line.     At the outset, the results diverged substantially from chance, as is
frequently the case for small sample sizes.  But as the number of
experiments increased, the results converged toward the chance
expectation, ending up in a decreasing magnitude random walk around
it.  This is precisely what is expected from probability theory, and
hence we conclude no “999999 effect” exists.  Ensembles of Experiments: the X ² (Chi-Square) Test  So far, we've seen how the laws of probability predict the outcome of
large numbers of experiments involving random data, how to calculate
the probability of a given experimental result being due to chance,
and how one goes about framing a hypothesis, then designing and
running a series of experiments to test it.  Now it's time to examine
how to analyse the results from the experiments to determine whether
they provide evidence for the hypothesis and, if so, how much.  Since its introduction in 1900 by Karl Peterson, the chi-square
( X ²) test has become the most widely used measure of the
significance to which experimental results support or refute a
hypothesis.  Applicable to any experiment where discrete results can
be measured, it is used in almost every field of science.  The
chi-square test is the final step in a process which usually proceeds
as follows.   Based either on theory or examination of empirical
        data, a phenomenon is suggested to exist.  A hypothesis is framed incorporating the supposed
        phenomenon.  An experiment is designed to test the hypothesis.
        The experiment must produce results which differ
        based on the validity of the hypothesis.  The
        results of the experiment for the hypothesis-false
        ( null hypothesis ) case are calculated and,
        if appropriate, verified by a control experiment
        in which the hypothesised effect is excluded.  A series of experiments are conducted, and the
        results tabulated.  The chi-square test is applied to determine the
        significance of the discrepancy between the
        calculated null hypothesis case and the
        experimental results, and the probability that
        the discrepancy is the result of chance.  If
        that probability is very low, the experiment
        provides evidence for the hypothesis.   No experiment or series of experiments can ever prove a
hypothesis; one can only rule out other hypotheses and provide
evidence that assuming the truth of the hypothesis better explains the
experimental results than discarding it.  In many fields of science,
the task of estimating the null-hypothesis results can be formidable,
and can lead to prolonged and intricate arguments about the
assumptions involved.  Experiments must be carefully designed to
exclude selection effects which might bias the data.  Fortunately, retropsychokinesis experiments have an easily stated and
readily calculated null hypothesis: “The results will obey the
statistics for a sequence of random bits.” The fact that the data are
prerecorded guarantees (assuming the experiment software is properly
implemented and the results are presented without selection or
modification) that run selection or other forms of cheating cannot
occur.  (Anybody can score better than chance at coin flipping if
they're allowed to throw away experiments that come out poorly!)
Finally, the availability of all the programs in source code form and
the ability of others to repeat the experiments on their own premises
will allow independent confirmation of the results obtained here.  So, as the final step in analysing the results of a collection of n experiments, each with k possible outcomes, we
apply the chi-square test to compare the actual results with the
results expected by chance, which are just, for each outcome, its
probability times the number of experiments n .  Mathematically,
the chi-square statistic for an experiment with k possible outcomes, performed n times, in which Y 1 , Y 2 ,… Y k are the number of
experiments which resulted in each possible outcome, where the
probabilities of each outcome are p 1 ,
p 2 ,… p k is:     It's evident from examining this equation that the closer the
measured values are to those expected, the
lower the chi-square sum will be.  Further, from a chi-square
sum, the probability Q that the X ² sum for an experiment with d degrees of freedom (where d = k −1, one less
the number of possible outcomes) is consistent with the
null hypothesis can be calculated as:     Where Γ is the generalisation of the factorial
function to real and complex arguments:     Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for Q , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  If your Web browser supports
JavaScript, you can use the Chi-Square
Calculator to calculate the probability from a chi-square value
and number of possible outcomes, or calculate the chi-square from the
probability and the number of possible outcomes.  In applying the chi-square test, it's essential to understand that only
very small probabilities of the null hypothesis are significant.
If the probability that the null hypothesis can explain the experimental
results is above 1%, an experiment is generally not considered evidence
of a different hypothesis.  The chi-square test takes
into account neither the number of experiments performed nor the
probability distribution of the expected outcomes; it is valid
only as the number of experiments becomes large, resulting in
substantial numbers for the most probable results.  If a hypothesis
is valid, the chi-square probability should converge on a
small value as more and more experiments are run.  Now let's examine an example of how the chi-square test identifies
experimental results which support or refute a hypothesis.  Our
simulated experiment consists of 50,000 runs of 32 random bits each.
The subject attempts to influence the random number generator to emit
an excess of one or zero bits compared to the chance expectation of
equal numbers of zeroes and ones.  The following table gives the
result of a control run using the random number generator without the
subject's attempting to influence it.  Even if the probability of
various outcomes is easily calculated, it's important to run control
experiments to make sure there are no errors in the experimental
protocol or apparatus which might bias the results away from those
expected.  The table below gives, for each possible number of one
bits, the number of runs which resulted in that count, the expectation

voodoo, tampering with the apparatus when we weren't

that out of every 200 bits there's an average of 101 one bits and 99
zeroes.  This seemingly subtle bias would result in an experiment like

Tossed coin    Coin flipping , coin tossing , or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands to choose between two alternatives, sometimes to resolve a dispute between two parties.

Coin flipping was known to the Romans as navia aut caput ("ship or head"), as some coins had a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the other. [1] In England, this was referred to as cross and pile . [1] [2] The expression Heads or Tails results from heads and tails being considered complementary body parts.  Process [ edit ]  During a coin toss, the coin is thrown into the air such that it rotates edge-over-edge several times. Either beforehand or when the coin is in the air, an interested party calls "heads" or "tails", indicating which side of the coin that party is choosing. The other party is assigned the opposite side. Depending on custom, the coin may be caught; caught and inverted; or allowed to land on the ground. When the coin comes to rest, the toss is complete and the party who called correctly or was assigned the upper side is declared the winner.  It is possible for a coin to land on its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even on a flat surface it is possible for a coin to land on its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. [3]  Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped. [4]  The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides; it need not be a circulating coin as such. Larger coins tend to be more popular than smaller ones. Some high-profile coin tosses, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Super Bowl, use custom-made ceremonial medallions. [5] [6]  Three-way [ edit ]  Three-way coin flips are also possible, by a different process – this can be done either to choose two out of three, or to choose one out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, either reverse this (the odd coin out is the winner ), or add a regular two-way coin flip between the remaining players as a second step. Note that the three-way flip is 87.5% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, which occurs 1/8 of the time due to the chances being 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.5, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that "heads" or "tails" be called. A famous example of such a three-way coin flip (choose two out of three) is dramatized in Friday Night Lights (originally a book , subsequently film and TV series ), where three high school football teams with identical records use a three-way coin flip – at a truck stop – to determine which two will advance to the playoffs. [7] [8] A legacy of this coin flip was to reduce the use of coin flips to break ties in Texas sports, instead using point-systems to reduce the frequency of ties.  Use in dispute resolution [ edit ]     The coin toss at the start of Super Bowl XLIII    Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.     Navy-Notre Dame coin toss    Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football , volleyball , and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame , and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The XFL , a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style "opening scramble," in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football , in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football.  In an association football match, the team winning the coin toss chooses which goal to attack in the first half; the opposing team kicks off for the first half. For the second half, the teams switch ends, and the team that won the coin toss kicks off. Coin tosses are also used to decide which team has the pick of going first or second in a penalty shoot-out . Before the early-1970s introduction of the penalty shootout , coin tosses were occasionally needed to decide the outcome of tied matches. The most famous instance of this was the semifinal game of the 1968 European Championship in Italy between Italy and the Soviet Union , which finished 0-0 after extra time. Italy won, and went on to become European champions. [9]     Tossing a coin is common in many sports, such as cricket , where it is used to decide which team gets the choice of bowling or batting first. Shown are Don Bradman and Gubby Allen  tossing for innings .    In cricket the toss is often significant, as the decision whether to bat or bowl first can influence the outcome of the game. Similarly, in tennis a coin toss is used in professional matches to determine which player serves first. The player who wins the toss decides whether to serve first or return, while the loser of the toss decides which end of the court each player plays on first.  In duels a coin toss was sometimes used to determine which combatant had the sun at his back. [10] In some other sports, the result of the toss is less crucial and merely a way to fairly choose between two more or less equal options.  The National Football League also has a coin toss for tie-breaking among teams for playoff berths and seeding, but the rules make the need for coin toss, which is random rather than competitive, very unlikely. A similar procedure breaks ties for the purposes of seeding in the NFL Draft ; these coin tosses are more common, since the tie-breaking procedure for the draft is much less elaborate than the one used for playoff seeding.  Major League Baseball once conducted a series of coin flips as a contingency on the last month of its regular season to determine home teams for any potential one-game playoff games that might need to be added to the regular season. Most of these cases did not occur. From the 2009 season , the method to determine home-field advantage was changed. [11]  Fédération Internationale d'Escrime rules use a coin toss to determine the winner of a fencing match that remains tied at the end of a " sudden death " extra minute of competition. Although in most international matches this is now done electronically by the scoring apparatus. [ citation needed ]  In the United States  Asa Lovejoy and Francis W. Pettygrove , who each owned the claim to the land that would later become Portland, Oregon , wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns of Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine ; Pettygrove won the coin flip . [12]  Scientists sometimes use coin flipping to determine the order in which they appear on the list of authors of scholarly papers . [13]  Politics [ edit ]  Australia [ edit ]  In December 2006, Australian television networks Seven and Ten , which shared the broadcasting of the 2007 AFL Season , decided who would broadcast the Grand Final with the toss of a coin. Network Ten won. [ citation needed ]  Canada [ edit ]  In some jurisdictions, a coin is flipped to decide between two candidates who poll equal number of votes in an election , or two companies tendering equal prices for a project. For example, a coin toss decided a City of Toronto tender in 2003 for painting lines on 1,605 km of city streets: the bids were $161,110.00 ($100.3800623 per km), $146,584.65 ($91.33 per km, exactly), and two equal bids of $111,242.55 ($69.31 per km, exactly).  Philippines [ edit ]  " Drawing of lots " is one of the methods to break ties to determine a winner in an election; the coin flip is considered an acceptable variant. Each candidate will be given five chances to flip a coin; the candidate with the most number of "heads" wins. The 2013 mayoral election in San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro was decided on a coin flip, with a winner being proclaimed after the second round when both candidates remained tied in the first round. [14]  United Kingdom [ edit ]  In the United Kingdom, if a local or national election has resulted in a tie where candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, then the winner can be decided either by drawing straws/lots, coin flip, or drawing a high card in pack of cards. [15] [16]  United States [ edit ]  In the United States , a coin toss determines the class of the senators of a state being added to the Union, with the new state's senators due to be entering the US Senate . [17] A number of states provide for "drawing lots" in the event an election ends in a tie - this is usually resolved by a coin toss or picking names from a hat. [18] A 2017 election to the 94th District of the Virginia House of Delegates resulted in both Republican incumbent David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds tied with exactly 11,608 votes. Under state law, the election was to be decided by drawing a name from a bowl, although a coin toss would also have been an acceptable option. The chair of the Board of Elections drew the film canister with Yancey's name, and he was declared the winner. [19] Additionally, the outcome of the draw determined control of the entire House, as Republicans won 50 of the other 99 seats and Democrats 49. A Yancey win extended the Republican advantage to 51-49, whereas a Simmonds win would have resulted in a 50-50 tie. As there is no provision for breaking ties in the House as a whole, this would have forced a power sharing agreement between the two parties. [20]  Physics [ edit ]  The outcome of coin flipping has been studied by Persi Diaconis and his collaborators. They have demonstrated that a mechanical coin flipper which imparts the same initial conditions for every toss has a highly predictable outcome – the phase space is fairly regular. Further, in actual flipping, people exhibit slight bias – "coin tossing is fair to two decimals but not to three. That is, typical flips show biases such as .495 or .503." [21]  In studying coin flipping, to observe the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, so that when the speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time. [21]  Moreover, their theoretical analysis of the physics of coin tosses predicts a slight bias for a caught coin to be caught the same way up as it was thrown, with a probability of around 0.51, [22] though a subsequent attempt to verify this experimentally gave ambiguous results. [23] Stage magicians and gamblers, with practice, are able to greatly increase this bias, whilst still making throws which are visually indistinguishable from normal throws. [21]  Since the images on the two sides of actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to slightly favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing. Coin spinning is much more likely to be biased than flipping, and conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.  Counterintuitive properties [ edit ]  Human intuition about conditional probability is often very poor and can give rise to some seemingly surprising observations. For example, if the successive tosses of a coin are recorded as a string of "H" and "T", then for any trial of tosses, it is twice as likely that the triplet TTH will occur before THT than after it. It is three times as likely that THH will precede HHT, than that THH will follow HHT. [24] (See Penney's game )  Mathematics [ edit ]  The mathematical abstraction of the statistics of coin flipping is described by means of the Bernoulli process ; a single flip of a coin is a Bernoulli trial . In the study of statistics, coin-flipping plays the role of being an introductory example of the complexities of statistics. A commonly treated textbook topic is that of checking if a coin is fair .  Telecommunications [ edit ]  Further information: Commitment scheme  There is no reliable way to use a true coin flip to settle a dispute between two parties if they cannot both see the coin—for example, over the phone. The flipping party could easily lie about the outcome of the toss. In telecommunications and cryptography , the following algorithm can be used:   Alice and Bob each choose a random string, "ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd" and "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" respectively.  Alice chooses an outcome for an imaginary coin flip, such as "tail"  Bob sends Alice his random string "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd"  Alice immediately computes a cryptographic hash of the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd", which is 59dea408d43183a3937957e71a4bcacc616d9cbc and sends it to Bob  Alice asks Bob: "heads or tails"?  Bob says, for instance, "heads".  Alice tells him she's just won, and proves it by showing the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd".  Bob can check that Alice didn't lie by computing the SHA-1 of the string himself  Furthermore, Bob by providing his own randomly generated string guarantees that Alice wasn't able to precompute an image pair of "tail/random string" or "head/random string".   Lotteries [ edit ]  The New Zealand  lottery game Big Wednesday uses a coin toss. If a player matches all 6 of their numbers, the coin toss will decide whether they win a cash jackpot (minimum of NZ$25,000) or a bigger jackpot with luxury prizes (minimum of NZ$2 million cash, plus value of luxury prizes.) The coin toss is also used in determining the Second Chance winner's prize.  Clarifying feelings [ edit ]  A technique attributed to Sigmund Freud to help in making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I want you to do is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." [25]  Danish poet Piet Hein 's book Grooks includes a poem on a similar theme:   A Psychological Tip  Whenever you're called on to make up your mind, And you're hampered by not having any, The best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find, Is simply by spinning a penny. No—not so that chance shall decide the affair While you're passively standing there moping; But the moment the penny is up in the air, You suddenly know what you're hoping.

that we have a well defined repeatable (in principle) experiment,
which has as its outcome a set of well defined, mutually exclusive ,
events.  Examples:  In the experiment of flipping a coin, the mutually
exclusive outcomes are the coin landing either heads up or tails up.  In the experiment of rolling one die, the mutually
exclusive outcomes are the die landing with either the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or
6 face up.  (When we speak of the "probability" that the Buffalo
Bills will win the Super Bowl next year, we are using the word 
"probability"
in its colloquial sense, not its mathematical sense. This is because the
Buffalo Bills winning the Super Bowl in a given year is not a repeatable
experiment.)  2) We assume that in any particular individual trial
of the experiment, the outcome for that individual trial cannot be 
predicted
or known before hand - it is controlled by chance. However, when a very
large number of independent trials of the experiment are performed,
one finds that each possible outcome occurs a well defined fraction of
the time. This fraction is called the probability for that 
particular
outcome to occur. The probability for an outcome is always a number between
0 and 1. If the probability is zero, we say that this outcome can never
occur. If the probability is one, we say that this outcome always occurs
with complete certainty.  Examples:  When we flip a coin a very large number of times,
we find that we get half heads, and half tails. We conclude that the 
probability
to flip a head is 1/2, and the probability to flip a tail is 1/2.  When we role a die a very large number of times,
we find that we get any given face 1/6 of the time. The probability for
the 1 face to appear is therefore 1/6. Similarly the probability for the
2 (3, 4, 5, or 6) face to appear is also 1/6.  What exactly we mean when we say "a very large number
of times" we will come to in a little while (is 10 times "large" enough?
is 100 times?)  3) The probability for a given outcome might be 
calculable
from some underlying assumptions. Or the probability for an outcome can
be determined experimentally by doing many trials.  Example:  When we flip a coin, we assume that there is no major
difference between the two sides, and there is no exacting way we perform
the flip in order to try and influence the outcome. Because of all the
random factors beyond our control that enter the flipping process (force
with which the coin is flipped, motion of the air in the room, position
of our hand when we catch the coin...) we therefore expect a probability
of 1/2 for heads, and 1/2 for tails. Each possible outcome is equally
likely . However, if we did a very large number of trial flips, and
consistently found heads occurring 3/4 of the time, and tails 1/4 of the
time, we would know that our assumption of equally likely outcomes was
false - we are dealing with a loaded coin. Performing the experiment is
the way to test the assumptions!  Let's now see how these ideas work for some more
complicated examples.  1) Consider the experiment of flipping of 4 
coins.  Each coin flip has 2 possible outcomes, so the 
flipping
of 4 coins has 2 x 2 x 2 x 2
= 16 possible outcomes. We can enumerate all possible outcomes as follows,
where H indicates a head, and T a tail:  HHHH      THHH  HHHT      THHT  HHTH      THTH  HHTT      THTT  HTHH      TTHH  HTHT      TTHT  HTTH      TTTH  HTTT       TTTT  If we assume that each individual coin is equally
likely to come up heads or tails, then each of the above 16 outcomes to
4 flips is equally likely. Each occurs a fraction one out of 16 times,
or each has a probability of 1/16.  Alternatively, we could argue that the 1st coin has
probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, the 2nd coin has probability
1/2 to come up heads or tails, and so on for the 3rd and 4th coins, so
that the probability for any one particular sequence of heads and tails
is just (1/2)x(1/2) x (1/2)x(1/2)=(1/16).  Now lets ask: what is the probability that in 4 
flips,
one gets N heads, where N=0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. We can get this just by 
counting
the number of outcomes above which have the desired number of heads, and
dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, 16.    N  # outcomes with
N heads  probability to get N 
heads  0               

1                                      

1/16 = 0.0625  1               

4                                      

4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25  2               

6                                     

6/16 = 3/8 = 0.375  3               

4                                     

4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25  4               

1                                     

1/16 = 0.0625  We can plot these results on a graph as shown 
below.   The dashed line is shown just as a guide to the
eye. Notice that the curve has a "bell" shape. The most likely outcome
is for N=2 heads, where the curve reaches its maximum value. This is just
what you would expect: if each coin is equally likely to land heads as
tails, in four flips, half should come up heads, that is N = 
4 x (1/2)
= 2 is the most likely outcome. Note however that an occurrence of N =
1 or N = 3 is not so unlikely - they occur 1/4 or 25% of the time. To have
an occurrence of only N = 0, or N = 4 (no heads, or all heads) is much
less likely - they occur only 1/16 or 6.25% of the time.  The above procedure is in principle the way to solve
all problems in probability. Define the experiment, enumerate all possible
mutually exclusive outcomes (which are usually assumed to be each equally
likely), and then count the number of these outcomes which have the 
particular
property being tested for (here for example, the number of heads). Dividing
this number by the total number of possible outcomes then gives the 
probability
of the system to have that particular property.  Often, however, the number of possible outcomes may
be so large that an explicit enumeration would become very tedious. In
such cases, one can resort to more subtle thinking to arrive at the desired
probabilities. For example, we can deduce the probabilities to get N heads
in 4 flips as follows:  N=0: There is only one possible outcome that gives
0 heads, namely when each flip results in a tail. The probability is 
therefore
1/16.  N=4: There is only one possible outcome that gives
4 heads, namely when each flip results in a head. The probability is 
therefore
1/16.  N=1: There are 4 possible outcomes which will have
only one coin heads. It may be that the 1st coin is heads, and all others
are tails; or it may be that the 2nd coin is heads, and all others are
tails; or it may be that the 3rd (or the 4th) coin is heads, and all others
are tails. Since there are 4 possible outcomes with one head only, the
probability is 4/16 = 1/4.  N=3: To get 3 heads, means that one gets only one
tail. This tail can be either the 1st coin, the 2nd coin, the 3rd, or the
4th coin. Thus there are only 4 outcomes which have three heads. The 
probability
is 4/16 = 1/4.  N=2: To enumerate directly all the possible outcomes
which have exactly 2 heads only, is a bit trickier than the other cases.
We will come to it shortly. But we can get the desired probability for
N=2 the following way: We have already enumerated all possible outcomes
with either N = 0, 1, 3, or 4 heads. These account for 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 =
10 possible outcomes. The only outcomes not include in these 10 are those
with exactly N=2 heads. Since there are 16 possible outcomes, and 10 do
not have N=2 heads, there must therefore be exactly 16 - 10 = 6 outcomes
which do have exactly N=2 heads. The probability for N=2 is therefore 6/16
= 3/8.  2) Consider the experiment of rolling 3 dice, each
of which has 6 sides.  What is the probability that no two dice land with
the same number side up, i.e. each of the three dice rolls a different
number?  Since each die has 6 possible outcomes, the number
of possible outcomes for the roll of three dice is 6x6x6 = 216. We could
enumerate all these 216 possibilities, and then count the number of 
outcomes
in which each die has a different number. This is clearly too tedious!
Instead we reason as follows:  When the 1st die is rolled, it can land with anyone
of its 6 faces up. When the 2nd die is rolled, there are only 5 possible
sides which will be consistent with our criterion that no two die land
the same. When the 3rd die is rolled, it must land with a face different
from die one and two; there are 4 possibilities. Therefore the total number
of outcomes which have each of the three dice with a different side up
is 6x5 x 4 = 120.  The probability for this to happen is then 120/216
= 5/9 = .55555...  Alternatively, we can say that the probability for
the 1st die to land with any side up is 1, the probability for the 2nd
die to land with a side different from the 1st die is 5/6, and the 
probability
for the 3rd die to land with a side different from both the 1st and the
2nd die is 4/6. The probability that each of the three dice has a different
side up is then (1) x (5/6) x (4/6)
= 20/36 = 5/9.  We learn from the above examples three general rules
about probabilities:  1) The probability than any one of a given group
of mutually exclusive possible outcomes will actually occur in a given
experiment, is the sum of the individual probabilities for each outcome
in the group.  Example:  In counting the number of heads in 4 coin flips,
the probability that we get exactly one head is the probability that we
get anyone of the following 4 outcomes: HTTT, THTT, TTHT, or TTTH. Each
has probability 1/16, so the probability to get exactly one head in 4 flips
is 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.  A consequence of this fact is that the sum of the 
probabilities
for all the possible outcomes must equal 1. This is just saying that the
probability that the experiment yields some outcome (we don't care which
outcome) is just unity, i.e.. it is certain to happen!  2) The probability for two independent events to
both occur is just the product of the probabilities for each individual
event.  Example:  The probability for no heads to occur in four flips
was (1/2) x (1/2) x (1/2)x(1/2)
= 1/16.  3) The probability for two events to both occur, even
if they are not independent, is the probability for the first to occur,
times the probability for the second to occur given the condition that
the first has already occurred.  Example:  The probability that the second die lands with
a different face than the first is the probability that the 1st lands with
any face times the probability that the second lands with a different face,
1x(5/6)=5/6. The probability that the 3rd die lands with yet a different
face is 5/6 times the probability that the 3rd die lands with one of the
4 other faces, (5/6) x (4/6) = 20/36 = 
5/9.  Some more examples:  1) If we roll 4 dice, what is the probability that
at least one of them lands with the "6" face on top?  Since each dice can land 6 ways, and there are 4
dice, there are 6 x 6 x 6x6
= 6 4 = 1,296 different possible outcomes. We could
in principle write these all down and then count the number which have
at least one "6", but this is way too tedious. Instead, lets count the
number of outcomes which do not have any "6"s showing. To have no
"6" showing, the first dice can land in any one of 5 possible ways. 
Similarly
for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th die. Thus the number of outcomes with no "6"
showing on any die is 5 x 5 x 5x5
= 5 4 = 625. Since we must either see no "6"s, or else
we see at least one "6", it follows that the number of outcomes with at
least one "6" must be the (total number of outcomes) - (number of outcomes
with no "6") = 1,296 - 625 = 671. The probability to have at least one
"6" is therefore 671/1296 = 0.5177469...  We could also have arranged our calculation as 
follows:      Written this way, we see that (5/6) is the 
probability
that any give die lands without a "6" on top. 
(5/6)x(5/6)x(5/6) x (5/6)
is therefore (general rule #2) the probability that all 4 dice land without
a "6" on top. Since the probability of all possible outcomes must sum to
unity (general rule #1), we therefore conclude that 1 - 
(5/6)x(5/6)x(5/6) x (5/6)
is the probability that the opposite of "all 4 dice land without a "6"
on top" happens. But the opposite of "all 4 dice land without a "6" on
top" is that "at least one die lands with a "6" on top"!  In this example we see that we can divide all our
possible outcomes into two classes. One class which has the desired 
property
we are testing for (in this case, at least one "6" on top), and a second
class which does not have the desired property (no dice has a "6" on top).
Often it turns out to be hard to directly calculate the probability for
the desired property, but easy to calculate the probability not to find the desired property. The first probability is then just unity
minus the second probability.  2) What is the probability that in a group of N 
people,
we will find at least 2 people with the same birthday? For the purpose
of this question, we will consider people born on February 29 as if they
were born on February 28!  This is equal to 1 - (probability no 2 people have
same birthday)  Probability that no 2 people have the same birthday
is:  =  since the first person can have any birthday, the
second person can have only one of the remaining 364 out of 365 possible
birthdays (i.e. not the same as the first), the third person can have only
one of the remaining 363 out 365 possible birthdays (i.e. not the same
as either the first or the second), and so on, down to the last Nth person.
So the probability that at least 2 people in a group of N have the
same birthday is:  p(N) = 1 -  We can plot p(N) versus N on a graph, as shown 
below.   Note that for N=10, p(10)=0.11695, or about 12% 
chance
to have two people with the same birthday. For N=50, p(50)=0.97037, or
97% chance to have two people with the same birthday. These probabilities
are in general much larger than most people's intuition would have 
guessed.    Examples from Text:  1) Two fair dice are rolled. What is the probability
p that at least one die come up a 3?  We can do this two ways:  i) The straightforward way is as follows. To get
at least one 3, would be consistent with the following three mutually 
exclusive
outcomes:  the 1st die is a 3 and the 2nd is not: prob = 
(1/6)x(5/6)=5/36  the 1st die is not a 3 and the 2nd is: prob = 
(5/6)x((1/6)=5/36  both the 1st and 2nd come up 3: prob = 
(1/6)x(1/6)=1/36  sum of the above three cases is prob for at least
one 3, p = 11/36  ii) A faster way is as follows: prob at least one
3 = 1 - (prob no 3's)  The probability to get no 3's is (5/6)x(5/6) = 
25/36.  So the probability to get at least one 3 is, p =
1 - (25/36) = 11/36  2) What is the probability that a card drawn at 
random
from an ordinary 52 deck of playing cards is a queen or a heart?  There are 4 queens and 13 hearts, so the probability
to draw a queen is  4/52 and the probability to draw a heart is 13/52.
But the probability to draw a queen or a heart is NOT the sum 4/52 + 13/52.
This is because drawing a queen and drawing a heart are not mutually 
exclusive
outcomes - the queen of hearts can meet both criteria! The number of cards
which meet the criteria of being either a queen or a heart is only 16 -
the 4 queens and the 12 remaining hearts which are not a queen. So the
probability to draw a queen or a heart is 16/52 = 4/13.  3) Five coins are tossed. What is the probability
that the number of heads exceeds the number of tails?  We can divide all possible outcomes into the 
following
two mutually exclusive groups:  i) the number of heads flipped is more than the 
number
of tails flipped  ii) the number of tails flipped is more than the
number of heads flipped  Since the probability to flip a head is the same
as the probability to flip a tail, the probability of outcome (i) must
be equal to the probability of outcome (ii). So both must be equal to 
1/2.  Note that this answer works for any odd number of
coin flips.  4) 4 boys and 3 girls are standing in a line. If
the position of each child in line is random, what is the probability that
the first 3 places in line are all girls?  We will solve this problem two ways:  i) Lets us count the number of all the possible 
orderings
of the 7 children which are consistent with the desired outcome (i.e. 3
girls in front) and divide by the total number of all possible 
orderings.  The total number of orderings is: 7x6x5 x 4x3x2 x 1  as there are 7 children to pick to be 1st in line,
only 6 remaining children to pick to be 2nd in line, then only 5 remaining
children to pick to be 3rd in line, and so on.  The number of orderings consistent with 3 girls in
front is: (3 x 2 x 1)x(4x3 x 2x1)  as there are 3 girls to pick to be 1st in line, 2
remaining girls to pick to be 2nd in line, and the last girl must go 3rd
in line; then there are 4 boys to place 4th in line, 3 remaining boys to
place 5th in line, and so on.  So the probability to get all 3 girls in front 
is  ii) Alternatively, we can argue as follows. The 
probability
that a girl is 1st in line is (3/7) since 3 of the 7 children are girls.
The probability that a girl is 2nd in line, given that the 1st is a girl,
is (2/6) since 2 of the remaining 6 children are girls. The probability
that a girl is 3rd in line, given that the 1st and 2nd are girls, is (1/5)
since now only 1 of the remaining 5 children is a girl. So the probability
that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions are all girls is  (3/7) x (2/6)x(1/5)=1/35                                                                     Accessibility Navigation  Primary Navigation  Content      Toggle  Share   Search  Search Close    Search    Search        SUBSCRIBE (Left)    RENEW (Left)    GIVE A GIFT (Left)         Smithsonian    Subscribe (Mobile)      Facebook    Instagram    Pinterest    Twitter    Google+    Newsletter      Search  Search  Search    Search            SmartNews     History    Science    Innovation    Arts & Culture    Travel         Featured: Adélie Penguin Super-Colony Found       History     Archaeology    U.S. History    World History    Video    Newsletter         Featured: The Packhorse Librarians of the Great Depression       Science     Age of Humans    Human Behavior    Mind & Body    Our Planet    Space    Wildlife    Newsletter    Earth Optimism Summit         Featured: Life in the Cosmos       Innovation     Education    Energy    Health & Medicine    Technology    Video    Newsletter    Ingenuity Awards         Featured: Nine Innovators to Watch in 2018       Arts & Culture     Art    Books    Design    Food    Music & Film    Video    Newsletter         Featured: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking       Travel     Armenia    Austria    Norway    Taiwan    Family Travel    Travel With Us    Newsletter         Featured: Ten Major 2018 Anniversaries Worth Traveling For       At the Smithsonian     Visit    Exhibitions    New Research    Artifacts    Curators' Corner    Ask Smithsonian    Podcasts    Lodging    Newsletter    Voices         Featured: Sidedoor: A Smithsonian Podcast       Photos     Submit to Our 2018 Contest    2017 Photo Contest Winners Announced    Photo of the Day    Tumblr    Instagram       Videos & Podcasts     Ingenuity Awards    Ask Smithsonian    Smithsonian Channel    Video Contest    Podcasts       Games     Daily Sudoku    Universal Crossword    Daily Word Search    Jumble    Mah Jong Quest    KenKen    Backgammon       Subscribe (Top Menu)    Current Issue     Subscribe  Save 84% off the newsstand price!

If it comes up tails more than heads, you pay him the same. There are no hidden tricks. It’s a fair bet — safe to take, if you’re looking for a 50/50 chance.  Now, imagine the same offer, except that instead of flipping the coin, the other patron tells you he’s going to spin it. In fact, he’ll even let you provide the penny, just to guarantee there is no funny business. Twenty-five spins and if it comes up heads more often than tails, he’ll give you $20 again. But if tails comes up more often, you owe him $20.  Fair bet? Not if Persi Diaconis is right.  Diaconis is a professor of mathematics and statistics at Stanford University and, formerly, a professional magician. While his claim to fame is determining how many times a deck of cards must be shuffled in order to give a mathematically random result (it’s either five or seven, depending on your criteria), he’s also dabbled in the world of coin games. What he and his fellow researchers discovered ( here’s a PDF of their paper ) is that most games of chance involving coins aren’t as even as you’d think. For example, even the 50/50 coin toss really isn’t 50/50 — it’s closer to 51/49, biased toward whatever side was up when the coin was thrown into the air.  But more incredibly, as reported by Science News , spinning a penny, in this case one with the Lincoln Memorial on the back, gives even more pronounced odds — the penny will land tails side up roughly 80 percent of the time. The reason: the side with Lincoln’s head on it is a bit heavier than the flip side, causing the coin’s center of mass to lie slightly toward heads. The spinning coin tends to fall toward the heavier side more often, leading to a pronounced number of extra “tails” results when it finally comes to rest.  Because the coins typically pick up dirt and oils over time, trying the experiment at home may not yield such a large percentage of “tails” over “heads” — but a relatively new coin should still give you noticeable results.

Game Theory (Part 9)  John Baez  Last time we talked about independence of a pair of outcomes, but we can easily go on and talk about independence of a longer sequence of outcomes.  For example, suppose we have three coins.   Suppose:   the 1st coin has probability \( p_H\) of landing heads up and \( p_T\) of landing tails up;  the 2nd coin has probability \( q_H\) of landing heads up and \( q_T\) of landing tails up;  the 3rd coin has probability \( r_H\) of landing heads up and \( r_T\) of landing tails up.   Suppose we flip all of these coins: the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  What's the probability that we get this sequence of results: \( (H, T, T)\) If the coin flips are independent , the probability is just this product: \( p_H \, q_T \, r_T \) See the pattern?  We just multiply the probabilities.  And there's nothing special about coins here, or the number three . We could flip a coin, roll a die, pick a card, and see if it's raining outside. For example, what's the probability that we get heads with our coin, the number 6 on our die, an ace of spades with our cards, and it's raining? If these outcomes are independent , we just calculate: the probability that we get heads, times
the probability that we roll a 6, times
the probability that we get an ace of spades, times
the probability that it's raining outside. Let's solve some puzzles using this idea! Three flips of a fair coin Example 1. Suppose you have a fair coin: this means it has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up.  Suppose you flip it three times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up, then tails up, then heads up? We're asking about the probability of this outcome: \( (H, T, H)\) Since the flips are independent this is \( p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H \, p_T \, p_H \) Since the coin is fair we have \( \displaystyle{ p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2} } \) so \(  \displaystyle{ p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} } \) So the answer is 1/8, or 12.5%. Example 2. In the same situation, what's the probability that the coin lands heads up exactly twice? There are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 outcomes that can happen: \( (H,H,H) \)
\( (H,H,T), \; (H,T,H), \; (T,H,H) \)
\( (H,T,T), \; (T,H,T), \; (T,T,H) \)
\( (T,T,T) \) We can work out the probability of each of these outcomes.  For example, we've already seen that \( (H,T,H)\) is \( \displaystyle{ p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{8} }\) since the coin is fair and the flips are independent.  In fact, all 8 probabilities work out the same way.  We always get 1/8.  In other words, each of the 8 outcomes is equally likely! But we're interested in the probability that we get exactly two heads.  That's the probability of this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) Using the rule we saw in Part 7 , this probability is \( \displaystyle{ p(S) = p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) So the answer is 3/8, or 37.5%. I could have done this a lot faster.  I could say "there are 8 outcomes that can happen, each equally likely, and three that give us two heads, so the probability is 3/8."   But I wanted to show you how we're just following rules we've already seen! Three flips of a very unfair coin Example 3. Now suppose we have an unfair coin with a 90% chance of landing heads up and 10% chance of landing tails up!  What's the probability that if we flip it three times, it lands heads up exactly twice?  Again let's assume the coin flips are independent. Most of the calculation works exactly the same way, but now our coin has \( \displaystyle{ p_H = 0.9, \quad p_T = 0.1 } \) We're interested in the outcomes where the coin comes up heads twice, so we look at this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) The probability of this subset is \( \begin{array}{ccl} p(S) &=& p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} \\  &=& p_T \, p_H  \, p_H + p_H \, p_T \, p_H + p_H \, p_H \, p_T \\ &=& 3 p_T p_H^2 \\ &=& 3 \times 0.1 \times 0.9^2 \\ &=& 0.3 \times 0.81 \\ &=& 0.243 \end{array}\) So now the probability is just 24.3%. Six flips of a fair coin Example 4. Suppose you have a fair coin.  Suppose you flip it six times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up exactly twice? We did a similar problem already, where we flipped the coin three times.  Go back and look at that if you forget!  The answer to that problem was \( \displaystyle{ 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) Why?  Here's why: there were 3 ways to get two heads when you flipped 3 coins, and each of these outcomes had probability \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} }\) We can do our new problem the same way.  Count the number of ways to get two heads when we flip six coins.  Then multiply this by \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} }\) The hard part is to count how many ways we can get two heads when we flip six coins.  To get good at probabilities, we have to get good at counting.  It's boring to list all the outcomes we're trying to count: (H,H,T,T,T,T), (H,T,H,T,T,T), (H,T,T,H,T,T), ... So let's try to come up with a better idea. We have to pick 2 out of our 6 flips to be H's.  How many ways are there to do this? There are 6 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, and then 5 ways left over to pick another and draw a blue H on it... letting the rest be T's.  For example: (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, we've got 6 × 5 = 30 choices.  But we don't really care which H is red and which H is blue—that's just a trick to help us solve the problem.  For example, we don't want to count (T, H , T, T, H , T) as different from (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, there aren't really 30 ways to get two heads.  There are only half as many!  There are 15 ways. So, the probability of getting two heads when we flip the coin six times is \( \displaystyle{ 15 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{15}{64} \approx .234 } \) where the squiggle means 'approximately'.  So: about 23.4%. Binomial coefficients Now for some jargon, which will help when we do harder problems like this.  We say there are 6 choose 2 ways to choose 2 out of 6 things, and we write this as \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2} } \) This sort of number is called a binomial coefficient . We've just shown that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2}  = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 }\) Why write it like this funky fraction: \( \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}\)?  Because it'll help us see the pattern for doing harder problems like this! Nine flips of a fair coin If we flip a fair coin 9 times, and the flips are independent, what's the probability that we get heads exactly 6 times? This works just like the last problem, only the numbers are bigger.  So, I'll do it faster! When we flip the coin 9 times there are \( 2^9\) possible outcomes that can happen.   Each of these is equally likely if it's a fair coin and the flips are independent.  So each has probability \( \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{2^9} } \) To get the answer, we need to multiply this by the number of ways we can get heads exactly 6 times.  This number is called '9 choose 6' or \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6}  }\) for short.  It's the number of ways we can choose 6 things out of a collection of 9. So we just need to know: what's 9 choose 6?  We can work this out as before.  There are 9 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, then 8 ways left to pick another and draw a blue H on it, and 7 ways left to pick a third and draw a orange H on it.  That sounds like 9 × 8 × 7. But we've overcounted!   After all, we don't care about the colors.  We don't care about the difference between this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) and this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) In fact we've counted each possibility 6 times!  Why six?   The first H could be red, green or blue — that's 3 choices.  But then the second H could be either of the two remaining 2 colors... and for the third, we just have 1 choice.  So there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to permute the colors. So, the actual number of ways to get 6 heads out of 9 coin flips is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) In other words: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) To get the answer to our actual problem, remember we need to multiply \( 1/2^9\) by this.  So the answer is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6} }\) If you're a pure mathematician, you can say you're done now.  But normal people won't understand this answer, so let's calculate it out.  I hope you know the first ten powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.  So: \( \displaystyle{ 2^9 = 512 }\) I hope you can also do basic arithmetic like this: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84} \) So, the probability of getting 6 heads when you do 9 independent flips of a fair coin is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6}  = \frac{84}{512} = 0.164025 } \) or 16.4025%. I broke down and used a calculator at the last step.   We're becoming serious nerds here. Okay, that's enough for now.  We've been counting how many ways we can get a certain number of heads from a certain number of coin flips.  What we're realy doing is taking a set of coin flips, say \( n\) of them, and choosing a subset of \( k\) of them to be heads.  So, we say Definition. The binomial coefficient  \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} } \) called \( n\) choose \( k,\) is the number of ways of choosing a subset of \( k\) things from a set of \( n\) things. We have seen in some examples that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1} } \) Here there's a product of \( k\) consecutive numbers on top, and \( k\) on bottom too.  We didn't prove this is true in general, but it's not hard to see, using the tricks we've used already.

When asked the question, what is the probability of a coin toss coming up heads, most people answer without hesitation
that it is 50%, 1/2, or 0.5                      we get this probability by assuming that the coin is fair, or heads and tails are equally likely The probability for equally likely outcomes is:  Number of outcomes in the event ÷ Total number of possible outcomes  For the coin, number of outcomes to get heads  = 1 Total number of possible outcomes = 2 Thus, we get 1/2 However, if you suspect that the coin may not be fair, you can toss the coin  a large number of times and 
count the number of heads Suppose you flip the coin 100 and get 60 heads, then you know the best estimate to get head is 60/100 = 0.6 This way of looking at probability is called the relative frequency estimate of a probability The interesting thing with this is that the more you flip the coin, the closer you get to 0.5 If you have a computer, you can simulate coin toss probability with different numbers of coin tosses, the result might be a table like this.     Number of tosses    Number of heads    Probability to get heads     4  1  0.25    100  56  0.56    1000  510  0.510    10000  4988  0.4988     Notice that for 10000 flip, the probability is close to 0.5 Try the same experiment to get the coin toss probability with the following coin flip simulation. After you have flipped the coin so many times, you should get answers close to 0.5 for both heads and tails                                      Homepage Algebra lessons Understanding probability Coin toss probability               Recent Articles                                 What is an exponential function  Apr 09, 18 06:04 PM Definition of exponential function and some examples of functions that are exponential functions  Read More    New math lessons        Email    First Name (optional)    Subscribe     Your email is safe with us.

You do $n = 10$ trials. The probability of one successful trial is $p = \frac{1}{2}$. You want $k = 3$ successes and $n - k = 7$ failures. The probability is:  $$
\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \binom{10}{3} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{3} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{7} = \dfrac{15}{128}
$$  One way to understand this formula: You want $k$ successes (probability: $p^k$) and $n-k$ failures (probability: $(1-p)^{n-k}$).

Since the positive outcomes are equally likely, it's simply adding them all up. – user190080  Nov 14 '17 at 15:02        add a comment |             up vote  22  down vote      We build a mathematical model of the experiment.  Write H for head and T for tail.  Record the results of the tosses as a string of length $10$, made up of the letters H and/or T.  So for example the string HHHTTHHTHT means that we got a head, then a head, then a head, then a tail, and so on.  There are $2^{10}$ such strings of length $10$.  This is because we have $2$ choices for the first letter, and for every such choice we have $2$ choices for the second letter, and for every choice of the first two letters, we have $2$ choices for the third letter, and so on.  Because we assume that the coin is fair, and that the result we get on say the first $6$ tosses does not affect the probability of getting a head on the $7$-th toss, each of these $2^{10}$ ($1024$) strings is equally likely . Since the probabilities must add up to $1$, each string has probability $\frac{1}{2^{10}}$.
So for example the outcome HHHHHHHHHH is just as likely as the outcome HTTHHTHTHT. This may have an intuitively implausible feel, but it fits in very well with experiments.  Now let us assume that we will be happy only if we get exactly $3$ heads.  To find the probability we will be happy, we count the number of strings that will make us happy. Suppose there are $k$ such strings. Then the probability we will be happy is $\frac{k}{2^{10}}$.  Now we need to find $k$. So we need to count the number of strings that have exactly $3$ H's.  To do this, we find the number of ways to choose  where the H's will occur. So we must choose $3$ places (from the $10$ available) for the H's to be.  We can choose $3$ objects from $10$ in $\binom{10}{3}$ ways. This number is called also by various other names, such as $C_3^{10}$, or ${}_{10}C_3$, or $C(10,3)$, and there are other names too. It is called a binomial coefficient , because it is the coefficient of $x^3$ when the expression $(1+x)^{10}$ is expanded.  There is a useful formula for the binomial coefficients. In general
$$\binom{n}{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.$$  In particular, $\binom{10}{3}=\frac{10!}{3!7!}$. This turns out to be $120$. So the probability of exactly $3$ heads in $10$ tosses is
$\frac{120}{1024}$.  Remark: The idea can be substantially generalized. If we toss a coin $n$ times, and the probability of a head on any toss is $p$ (which need not be equal to $1/2$, the coin could be unfair), then the probability of exactly $k$ heads is
$$\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}.$$
This probability model is called the Binomial distribution . It is of great practical importance, since it underlies all simple yes/no polling.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 31 '12 at 0:18             answered May 30 '12 at 23:01       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |             up vote  16  down vote      You are looking for  $$\frac{\text{Number of Relevant Outcomes}}{\text{Number ofTotal Outcomes}}.$$  The number of total outcomes is $2^{10}$. The number of relevant outcomes is the number of ways you can get exactly three heads in a string of 10 coin flips, or ${10}\choose{3}$.

Then you have to arrange 3 heads and 7 tails within 10 open slots.
We can name our Heads: $H(A)$, $H(B)$, and $H(C)$. Now, you can arrange the heads in such ways that $H(A)$ will essentially have 10 open slots, $H(B)$ will have 9 open slots and $H(C)$ will have 8 open slots. In other words there are: $$10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720$$ ways to arrange these heads. However, this accounts for the fact that all heads are different. Therefore the number of positions in which $H(x)$ can be arranged in is $$3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6,$$ and so there are: $$\frac{720}{6} = 120 $$
scenarios of which 3 heads and 7 tails are given. Therefore
$$P(\text{getting 3 heads and 7 tails}) = \frac{120}{1024} = \frac{15}{128} \approx 11.7\%.$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 14 '17 at 14:51       Xander Henderson   10.9k 7 25 42        answered Nov 14 '17 at 14:23       Emil Eriksson   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

If the coin is flipped two times what is the probability of getting a head in either of those attempts?  I think both the coin flips are mutually exclusive events, so the probability would be getting head in attempt 1 or attempt 2 which is :  P(attempt1) + P(attempt2) =  1/2 + 1/2 = 1  100% probability sounds wrong? What am I doing wrong. If i apply the same logic then probability of getting at least 1 head in 3 attempt will be 1/2+1/2+1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 which I know for sure is wrong.

"Mutually exclusive" simply means that the two events cannot happen together.  If A happens then B does not and if B happens A does not.  "Independent" simply means that the occurrence of one event is not conditional on the occurrence of the other.  The probability of A happening does not depend on whether B happens or not, and vice versa.   Let $H_n$ be the indexed event of getting a head on the $n^{th}$ flip.  Given an unbiased coin, $P(H_1)=P(H_2)=\frac 1 2$  These events are independent so $P(H_1 \cap H_2) = P(H_1)\times P(H_2)$.  The outcome of one coin toss does not influence the outcome of the other.  However they are not  mutually exclusive , so $P(H_1 \cup H_2) = P(H_1)+P(H_2) - P(H_1 \cap H_2)$.  Both coins can turn up heads.  Putting it together: $$\therefore P(H_1 \cup H_2) = \frac 12 + \frac 1 2 - \frac 12 \times \frac 12 = \frac 3 4$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 22 at 14:08       Alex Johnson   32 7        answered Mar 28 '14 at 9:56       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              1      So if I flip a coin 2 times, there is a 75% chance that I will get heads on at least one of the 2 flips? – Juan Velez  Aug 25 '15 at 16:47        3      @JuanVelez Yes, if there is no bias (ie: fair coins). $\boxed{\begin{array}{c|cc} ~& H & T \\ \hline H & HH & HT \\ T & TH & TT\end{array}}$ Four equally probable results, three of which are the favoured outcome. – Graham Kemp  Aug 25 '15 at 22:52         1      Would it follow, that in 3 tries you'd have an 87.5% chance of success? – Lonnie Best  Dec 20 '15 at 23:15        2      @LonnieBest Yes, it does indeed follow that the change of at least one success in three flips is $1-0.5^3$. – Graham Kemp  Dec 21 '15 at 0:29        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Let $A$ be the event of getting a tail in both tosses, then $A'$ be the event of getting a head in either tosses.

Any more than four heads in a row, such as "HHHHH" would not be considered a string of four consecutive heads. Seeing 10 sets of "HHHHT" would allow a max of 20 consecutive patterns.

For example, the sequence $$HHTHHHTTTHHHHTHT\dots TTHHHHHTHTHHTTHHHH$$ would be marked $${HHTHHHTTTHH}^{\color{red}|\!}{HHTHT\dots TTHHHHHTHTHHTTHH}^{\color{red}|\!}{HH}^{}.$$  Among the $97$ positions where marks could occur (from after the first two flips to before the final two), a mark does appear in each of the $2^{\rm nd}$ through $96^{\rm th}$ ($95$ in all) of those spots (as $THH^{\color{red}|\!}HHT$) with probability $\frac{1}{2^6}$ (the chance the surrounding sequence of six flips is $THHHHT$). In the first and last positions, the probability is $\frac{1}{2^5}$ (the chance of $HH^{\color{red}|\!}HHT$ for position $1$ and $THH^{\color{red}|\!}HH$ for position $97$).  By the linearity of expectation, the expected number of marks is $95\cdot\frac1{2^6}+2\cdot\frac1{2^5}=\frac{99}{64}$.  [Added] It may be easier to focus on the $H$’s and $T$’s instead of the spaces between them, so another way to mark the runs-of-$4$ is to color in red the last $H$ of each run, like $$HHTHHHTTTHHH\color{red}HTHT\dots TTHHHHHTHTHHTTHHH\color{red}H.$$ The first three $H$’s are colored red with probability $0$, the fourth with probability $\frac{1}{2^5}$, the next $95$ with probability $\frac{1}{2^6}$, and the last with probability $\frac{1}{2^5}$, giving the same result.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 24 '16 at 18:38             answered Jul 24 '16 at 18:28       Steve Kass   8,451 12 23                  Is it possible for you to let me know what the answer would be for 8 out of 100? – Triumph  Jul 27 '16 at 1:48            Try to modify my answer for runs of $8$.

We want the expectation of $X_1+\cdots+X_{97}$. By the linearity of expectation, this is $E(X_1)+\cdots+E(X_{97})$.  So we need only calculate the $\Pr(X_i)=1$.  These are not all equal. If $i=1$ or $i=97$, we have $\Pr(X_i=1)=\frac{1}{32}$. For all the other $i$, we have $\Pr(X_i=1)=\frac{1}{64}$. That is because in all but "end" cases, the string of $4$ H must be flanked by T on both sides.  The required expectation is therefore $2\cdot \frac{1}{32}+95\cdot\frac{1}{64}$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 24 '16 at 18:06             answered Jul 24 '16 at 18:00       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  Would this factor in the possibility of 10 heads in a row that would change you 100 coin flips into 90.

Assuming that either team has a 50% chance of winning each of the remaining games, what is the probability of the Heat winning 4 of the remaining games?   There are $6$ remaining games.  The desired criteria is that Heat wins at least $4$, when given that Heat lost the first 1.  This is a binomial distribution ; so named because of the use of the binomial coefficient to count number of permutations of outcomes that match the desired criteria.  The probability of exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials with probability $p$ of success in any trial, is: $${n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \;=\; \,^n\mathrm{\large C}_k\;p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \;=\; \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$  So: $\mathbb{\large P}(\text{win at least }4\text{ more of }6) = {6\choose 4}\left(\frac 12\right)^4\left(\frac 12\right)^2+{6\choose 5}\left(\frac 12\right)^5\left(\frac 12\right)^1+{6\choose 6}\left(\frac 12\right)^6\left(\frac 12\right)^0$.
$$\therefore \mathbb{\large P}(\text{win at least }5\text{ more of }6) = \frac 1{2^6}\left(\frac{6!}{4!2!}+\frac{6!}{5!1!}+\frac{6!}{6!0!}\right)$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '14 at 23:03             answered May 19 '14 at 1:38       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66                  = 42/64, or .65625 (Actually, the Pacers have won the first game, not the Heat.

It's given by:  $$\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$  Where $!$ denotes the factorial ($n!=n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdot ...\cdot 2\cdot1$), $n$ is the 'number of things', and $k$ is 'how many things are chosen'.  So in this specific case, $n=6, k=4$. That gives us the number of ways we can get 4 heads from 6 flips.  You can probably see how to extend this to your sports example, and lose the restriction that they're odds are only as good as a coin-flip.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '14 at 1:12       OJFord   312 1 2 15                  Thanks very much. I get 11/32 as the answer to my coin flipping question. However, I don't understand why I should "lose the restriction that the odds are only as good as a coin-flip" for these NBA games. Or if I did put the probability of the Heat winning each remaining game at .55, how would I calculate the probability of the Heat winning the series? – NotSuper  May 19 '14 at 1:47            Okay, so when you do $P(Win)=\frac{N_{WINS}}{N_{TOTAL}}$, you're implicitly doing $P(Win)=\frac{N_{WINS}}{N_{TOTAL}}\cdot\frac{P(WinGame)}{P(LoseGame)}$. Of course, $P(LoseGame)=1-P(WinGame)$. If you set the odds at 50/50, then you're just multiplying by 1, so you left it out. – OJFord  May 19 '14 at 1:54             Just to make sure that I understand you: P(Win) is the probability of the Heat winning the series, and P(Win) = (22/64)x(.55/.45) = .420.

To explain this:  Flip a coin $3$ times. What is the probability of getting at least $2$ heads?  MANUALLY :
We have (HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTT) $\Rightarrow 8$ cases.
here at least $2$ heads samples are: (HHH, HHT, HTH, THH) $\Rightarrow 4$ cases. So the probability is $4/8 = 1/2$.  WITH MY WAY:
$$\frac{1}{2^3} \left( \frac{3!}{(3-2)!2!} +\frac{3!}{(3-3)! 3!}\right) = \frac{3+1}{8} = \frac 12$$  In the same way it is going to work for the asked one. That's how we get $21/64$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 3 '15 at 13:30       John Ma   36.5k 9 35 67        answered Jul 3 '15 at 10:34       Chandramouli   17 2                  Could you be nice and explicit your way ? – Claude Leibovici  Jul 3 '15 at 11:03        add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      $$\frac{

We will put together atoms that consist of $0$ to $6$ heads followed by a tail.  Any arrangement of heads and tails without $7$ heads in a row, appended with a tail, can be uniquely made up of a number of such atoms.  All arrangements of such atoms appear once somewhere in the sum
$$
\sum_{k=0}^\infty(x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6+x^7)^k
$$
where $x$ represents $T$ $x^2$ represents $HT$ $x^3$ represents $HHT$ $\vdots$ $x^7$ represents $HHHHHHT$  For example, if we are looking for $HTTHHTTH$, append a $T$ and we get the term for $k=5$ where in the first factor, the $x^2$ ($HT$) was chosen, in the second factor, the $x$ ($T$) was chosen, then $x^3$ ($HHT$), then $x$ ($T$), then $x^2$ (HT), to get $HTTHHTTHT$. Note that the exponent of $x$ matches the number of tosses. To count the number of sequences of $40$ flips that do not contain $7$ consecutive heads, we look at the coefficient of $x^{41}$ in
$$
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=0}^\infty(x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6+x^7)^k
&=\frac1{1-x\frac{x^7-1}{x-1}}\\
&=\frac{1-x}{1-2x+x^8}
\end{align}
$$
The coefficient of $x^{41}$ is $955427104501$. There is a degree $8$ recursion to compute this without dividing polynomials: $c_n=2c_{n-1}-c_{n-8}$, where $c_n$ starts
$$
1,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,\dots
$$  The number of sequences of $40$ flips is $2^{40}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sequence of $7$ heads in a row in $40$ flips is
$$
1-\frac{955427104501}{2^{40}}=0.131044110526

If you say "I'm going to flip this coin heads the next 6 times" it's a 1/64 chance or 1.5%. So only slightly misleading   permalink embed save give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (2 children) True. So the odds are 1.5% for Clinton winning and 1.5% for the 'Sanders side'  of the coin.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] WT14  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (1 child) That's not the title of the OP though. That's framing the question two different ways.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I agree.  So mathematically speaking, his statement is incorrect.  But I think, especially given the subreddit we are on, his intended point is 'here are the odds of Hillary doing what she did last night'.  Again, technically wrong, but in no way intentionally misleading or stretching the facts, in the perspective of what the discussion is about.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] robotzor Ohio  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Haha all the people arguing your factual, known-stats and probability math here... hilarious.

Each event is 50-50, but the odds of them all happening independently is quite low. Sure, the odds of the last one happening is 50-50 after all the others happened, but statistics can tell us the chances of all of them coming up Clinton in a row.  I think /u/PreecherMan 's example with coins at friends houses is pretty good at showing how unlikely it is for all of them to land on one side.   permalink embed save give gold [–] PreecherMan [ S ]  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (5 children) Oh man. I'm getting into internet arguments again :)  Alright. Let's assume you're right. Let's replay this game. You can pick six different friends of yours and they can each toss a coin at their independent houses (until now, do you agree that this is the same situation as with the coin tosses in this case?).  If I understand you correctly, you say that these independent events are still 50-50. If you stick to that, you should be happy if I offered you a bet where I pay you 20 bucks when all six independent coins come up heads, but you pay me 10 bucks if they don't. According to you (again, if I got you right), you should win 20 bucks with a prob of 50% (which has an expected value of 10 bucks) and lose 10 bucks with a prob of 50% (expected value = -5 bucks) so you would win 5 bucks...  I would love to play this game with you until you have no money left :)   permalink embed save give gold [+] [deleted]  2 years ago  (4 children) [deleted]   [–] PreecherMan [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (2 children) So you would play that game with me?   permalink embed save give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Looks like you are going to win a good amount of money today.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Correct, but we aren't saying 'what are the odds of flipping heads after flipping heads 5 times in a row?' We are saying 'what are the odds of flipping heads 6 times in a row?'  Those are two very different questions, statistically speaking.  The answer to the first, as you said, is 50-50.  But the answer to the second is MUCH lower, 1.56%.  As you admitted yourself, the cumulation of the odds are against the likelihood of so many successive flips coming up heads. There is nothing wrong with /u/PreecherMan 's math except for the technicality mentioned by /u/WT14 , which is irrelevant when all we are doing is refuting this claim that the odds are 50-50.   permalink embed save give gold [–] JoshOliday Bernie Squad- Corporal  -3 points -2 points -1 points  2 years ago  (14 children) That may be true if the coin is the same, in the same place, under the same conditions. However, these coins and flips were all independent of each other. The statistics you're quoting aren't exactly correct.   permalink embed save give gold [–] PreecherMan [ S ]  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago  (13 children) They are not exactly correct. The exactly correct number is 1.5625%.  Here's how you do it:  If the game is "toss a coin once", then the chance is at 50% of getting heads.  If the game is "toss a coin twice" then the chance is at 25% to get heads two times in a row. Basically, you have four outcomes:   heads - heads  heads - tails  tails - heads  tails - tails   So 1 out of 4 = 25% or 50% x 50% = 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 = 25%  Play the game further (tossing a coin six times and get the same result every time) and you get 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 aka 0.5 6 = 0.015625 = 1.5625%.  Trust me.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] InvisibleBlue Europe  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) the actual probability is closer to 51 - 49 because of geometry of the object you're tossing and how the mass is spread out non-uniformly on the coin and sides of the coin.  If you spin the coin instead of tossing, odds get to 70 or 80% tails up because the extra weight on the heads causes a positive feedback loop that topples it over on that side most of the time.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] WT14  -1 points 0 points 1 point  2 years ago  (11 children)  Trust me.   Your math here frames your claim differently than the claim in the title though. The title doesn't say flip heads 6 times it says get the same result 6 times.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] pjk922 Massachusetts  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (6 children) It's the same thing. The chance of Hillary winning (regardless if she picked heads or tales) is .5 per event. .5 6 = .0156   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] ilessthan3math Massachusetts - Bernie Squad - Corporal  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) His argument is that the title is phrased more generally, saying the odds of getting the same result 6 times, which would include the odds of flipping heads 6 times in a row or flipping tails 6 times in a row. So the result should be double (3.12%) what OP reported.  However, this is just to be technically correct in the title.

A little common sense please?  You have said that I claim something different in the title than in my examples. That is incorrect. You just incorrectly assume that "getting the same result each time" means "getting tails six times or getting heads six times". It doesn't mean that. "result" = "winning".

Like that post saying that Bernie should have won the coin tosses because the rules said 'coin flip to determine who loses the delegate' or something like that. That is arguing semantics, and it frankly looks quite silly to try to pry at the results with arguments like that.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

( self.explainlikeimfive ) submitted 5 years ago by JavaOrlando I just finished watching a Khan Academy video on probability.  Salman explained that, the more times that you flip a coin, the closer your results will likely be to 50/50.  So, if I flip a coin 100 times, is the likeliness of it landing exactly 50 times on either side any greater than it landing all 100 times on the same side?   37 comments share save hide report all 37 comments sorted by: best (suggested) top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

Say you have four flips. You can only get four heads in a row if every flip is a head. But you can get two heads and two tails in six different ways:   Head, Head, Tail, Tail  Tail, Tail, Head, Head  THHT  HTTH  THTH  HTHT   This means that it is six times more likely that you will get two of each than all heads.  When you have big numbers, you can't list all the possibilities, so you have to use a more complicated formula as Bradm77 posted.   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (0 children) I get it now because of your example.

Yes, it's much greater. There is only one possible combination where it lands all heads, and that requires it to land heads every time. There are a bunch of combinations that result in it landing with exactly 50 heads. If the first flip doesn't land heads, that's fine, you can make it up later.  According to a binomial calculator I found here (with chance of success .5, 100 trials, and number of successes 50), it is about a 8% chance that you get exactly 50 heads. However, the chance that it is close to 50 (say 40-60), is really high.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Bradm77  17 0 Answer Link 16 points 17 points 18 points  5 years ago  (9 children) The formula for calculating this is:  (m + n)!/(m! x n!) x p m x q n  where p is the probability of success (in our case .5) and q is 1-p (again, .5) and m + n = the total number of repetitions (in our case, 100 flips) and m and n are success and failures, respectively (in our case, both are 50).  That leaves you with:  (100!)/(50! x 50!) x 0.5 50 x 0.5 50  This is really hard to calculate because the factorials make the numbers really big but the answer ends up being about 7.959%.

Instead of counting how many different combinations there are you can use the formula above.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  -3 points -2 points -1 points  5 years ago  (1 child) As someone who was never too good at Maths, this is how i see this formula.

A factorial just mean that you take the number before it and multiply it by every number below itself until you get to 1.  So 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.  100! = 100 x 99 x 98 x 97 x ... all the way down to 1.  Also, p m is p times p, repeated m times.  So 2 5 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 and 0.5 3 = 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] kitsovereign  3 0 Answer Link 2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (0 children) I can tell you the actual math and formulas, but let's keep it simple and abstract.  First of all, how many outcomes are there? If you flip one coin, just two. If you flip two coins, four. If you flip three coins, it's eight - two for the first times two for the second times two for the third. Simple numbers.  Flip 4 coins, and you're at 16 outcomes, a 2-digit number. Flip 10 coins, and and you're at a 4-digit number. 100 coins is a 31-digit number. Yikes! Roughly "a gajillion."  So, to answer the question you asked out-right: are the odds of an even 50-50 split better than all-heads? Well, of the gajillion outcomes for your hundred flips, there's only one where all the coins come up heads. Even if you're also counting "all tails", that's just two measly outcomes out of a gajillion - a drop in the bucket. (For comparison: There are 100 outcomes where you get 99 heads and 1 tails.)  Now think of how many ways you could get 50 heads and 50 tails. You could flip 50 heads in a row and then 50 tails in a row; or vice versa; you could have all the even flips be heads and the odd ones be tails; or vice versa; you could - why do I need to list them out? We've just come up with four ways. There's actually "a bunch" of ways - small compared to the "gajillion" outcomes, but still easily bigger than the single way to get all heads.  (The exact values of "gajillion" and "bunch" are left as an exercise to the reader.)  Now hold on a dang moment. Doesn't increasing the sample size (that is, the number of flips) actually decrease my odds of getting exactly 50-50? If I flip twice, I have four options: heads-heads, heads-tails, tails-heads, and tails-tails. So I've got even odds of coming up with exactly 50-50. If I flip 100 times, I'm far more likely to get 53-47 or 48-52 or something like that, right?  Well, right. Here's the catch: Increasing the sample size doesn't increase your odds that your experimental data will match the exact odds. Rather, it decreases the likelihood that your experimental data will be far off from the exact odds.  If you flip two coins, you have even odds of thinking that all coin flips have the same outcome! If you flip three coins, you have a disaster - you're either going to get "100-0" or "67-33." However, if you flip a larger amount of times - even if you flip an odd amount of times, where it'd be impossible to get an even 50-50 split - the chances that you'll get results close to 50-50 increases, and the odds that you'll get wacky results like all-heads will shoot down.   permalink embed save give gold [–] air139  3 0 Answer Link 2 points 3 points 4 points  5 years ago  (0 children) To explain this to a five year old, make a flow chart. Like this http://www.mathsonline.co.uk/nonmembers/resource/plans/prob_coin.gif Then after making 100 columns count all the lines that have equal heads and tails. Even though odd of exactly 50% is low, it is the highest chance.

Lets drop the numbers down to make it more manageable.  Flip a coin 4 times.  Draw a tree, almost like a family tree, except this new race does not need a mom and a dad, they just pop out kids at will.  Start with the first 2 beings in this new world.  Heads (H) and Tails (T).  Magically they each have 2 kids of their own, who are named H and T.  Those kids each have 2 kids of their own conveniently named H and T as well. And then again, once more.  4 generations, 4 coin flips.  Follow the path from top to bottom.  This will show you, visually, all the possibilities of the coin's Heads or Tails results.  16 different paths for the coin to follow as it lands on H or T.  Only one of those paths is HHHH and another is only TTTT.  Looking at the tree, their is 6 paths that end up as a 50/50 split:  HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, TTHH.  That means there is 2 chances for all one side, and 6 chances for 50/50.  This is shown as 2:6.  This ca be reduced down to 1:3.  3 times more likely to have an exact 50/50 ratio as opposed to all the same.  The reason for this:  When we counted those 50/50's, we did not care about the order that the result happened in, just the final tally.  If we were to go in specifically wanting HHTT in that exact order we would only have one possibility just like HHHH.  This ratio of 3:1 will change drastically though as you increase the number of flips. This is becasue at 100 flips, you still only have 2 chances for the coin to always have been either H or T.  While the number of results that lead to an exact 50/50 result will keep increasing as you add coin flips.   permalink embed save give gold [–] lalalalalalala71  1 0 Answer Link 0 points 1 point 2 points  5 years ago *  (0 children)  So, if I flip a coin 100 times, is the likeliness of it landing exactly 50 times on either side any greater than it landing all 100 times on the same side?   Short, non-numerical answer: yes it is, because there's only two ways for it landing all 100 times on the same side: either it lands heads every single time, or it lands tails every single time. For the other option, it can land heads the first 50 times and tails the other 50, or the other way around, or 10 heads then 10 tails then 10 heads (...), or a huge number of other possible combinations of heads and tails totalling 50 of each. This number of combinations is greater for 50/50 than any other pair of numbers.  Edit: the odds for 50/50 are greater than any other pair, if you count 51/49 as different from 49/51.   permalink embed save give gold [–] reached86  -1 0 Answer Link -2 points -1 points 0 points  5 years ago  (2 children) It lands on heads more often due to the minute increased weight of the coin on one side.   permalink embed save give gold [–] cruisintom  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 years ago  (1 child) Which coin?

Essentially, as Bradm77 said, it's about 8%. But it being off by one (either heads or tails winning) is probably 8.5%, and being off by one OR two would be even more likely.   permalink embed save give gold [–] NightlyNews  1 point 2 points 3 points  5 years ago  (0 children)  But it being off by one (either heads or tails winning) is probably 8.5%, and being off by one OR two would be even more likely.   The chances of it being either 49 or 51 heads is obviously higher than it being exactly 50 because that is two very slightly less (about .1%) separate occurrences compared to one.  It's about 7.8% twice, once for 49 heads and once for 51 heads. So it is much more accurate to say that there is a  ~15.6% chance of it being one off perfect 50/100 in either direction.   permalink embed save parent give gold [+] SecretDragoon  comment score below threshold -12 0 Answer Link -13 points -12 points -11 points  5 years ago  (3 children) What you're asking is "If I flipped a coin 100 times how many of them will be heads?" The probability is 50. You can't give an exact number like you want. The probability of a heads is 1/2. 1/2 over 100 times is still going to be 1/2 of those 100 times.   permalink embed save give gold [–] harrisonbeaker  5 points 6 points 7 points  5 years ago  (1 child) This is wrong in so many ways   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] synJstarcraft  0 points 1 point 2 points  5 years ago  (0 children) This actually really caught me off guard.

Coin flipping   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   "Heads or Tails" redirects here. For other uses, see Heads or Tails (disambiguation) .  For coin tossing as specific to the sport of cricket, see Toss (cricket) .     Tossed coin    Coin flipping , coin tossing , or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands to choose between two alternatives, sometimes to resolve a dispute between two parties. It is a form of sortition which inherently has only two possible and equally likely outcomes .

Coin flipping was known to the Romans as navia aut caput ("ship or head"), as some coins had a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the other. [1] In England, this was referred to as cross and pile . [1] [2] The expression Heads or Tails results from heads and tails being considered complementary body parts.  Process [ edit ]  During a coin toss, the coin is thrown into the air such that it rotates edge-over-edge several times. Either beforehand or when the coin is in the air, an interested party calls "heads" or "tails", indicating which side of the coin that party is choosing. The other party is assigned the opposite side. Depending on custom, the coin may be caught; caught and inverted; or allowed to land on the ground. When the coin comes to rest, the toss is complete and the party who called correctly or was assigned the upper side is declared the winner.  It is possible for a coin to land on its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even on a flat surface it is possible for a coin to land on its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. [3]  Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped. [4]  The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides; it need not be a circulating coin as such. Larger coins tend to be more popular than smaller ones. Some high-profile coin tosses, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Super Bowl, use custom-made ceremonial medallions. [5] [6]  Three-way [ edit ]  Three-way coin flips are also possible, by a different process – this can be done either to choose two out of three, or to choose one out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, either reverse this (the odd coin out is the winner ), or add a regular two-way coin flip between the remaining players as a second step. Note that the three-way flip is 87.5% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, which occurs 1/8 of the time due to the chances being 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.5, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that "heads" or "tails" be called. A famous example of such a three-way coin flip (choose two out of three) is dramatized in Friday Night Lights (originally a book , subsequently film and TV series ), where three high school football teams with identical records use a three-way coin flip – at a truck stop – to determine which two will advance to the playoffs. [7] [8] A legacy of this coin flip was to reduce the use of coin flips to break ties in Texas sports, instead using point-systems to reduce the frequency of ties.  Use in dispute resolution [ edit ]     The coin toss at the start of Super Bowl XLIII    Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.     Navy-Notre Dame coin toss    Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football , volleyball , and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame , and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The XFL , a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style "opening scramble," in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football , in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football.  In an association football match, the team winning the coin toss chooses which goal to attack in the first half; the opposing team kicks off for the first half. For the second half, the teams switch ends, and the team that won the coin toss kicks off. Coin tosses are also used to decide which team has the pick of going first or second in a penalty shoot-out . Before the early-1970s introduction of the penalty shootout , coin tosses were occasionally needed to decide the outcome of tied matches. The most famous instance of this was the semifinal game of the 1968 European Championship in Italy between Italy and the Soviet Union , which finished 0-0 after extra time. Italy won, and went on to become European champions. [9]     Tossing a coin is common in many sports, such as cricket , where it is used to decide which team gets the choice of bowling or batting first. Shown are Don Bradman and Gubby Allen  tossing for innings .    In cricket the toss is often significant, as the decision whether to bat or bowl first can influence the outcome of the game. Similarly, in tennis a coin toss is used in professional matches to determine which player serves first. The player who wins the toss decides whether to serve first or return, while the loser of the toss decides which end of the court each player plays on first.  In duels a coin toss was sometimes used to determine which combatant had the sun at his back. [10] In some other sports, the result of the toss is less crucial and merely a way to fairly choose between two more or less equal options.  The National Football League also has a coin toss for tie-breaking among teams for playoff berths and seeding, but the rules make the need for coin toss, which is random rather than competitive, very unlikely. A similar procedure breaks ties for the purposes of seeding in the NFL Draft ; these coin tosses are more common, since the tie-breaking procedure for the draft is much less elaborate than the one used for playoff seeding.  Major League Baseball once conducted a series of coin flips as a contingency on the last month of its regular season to determine home teams for any potential one-game playoff games that might need to be added to the regular season. Most of these cases did not occur. From the 2009 season , the method to determine home-field advantage was changed. [11]  Fédération Internationale d'Escrime rules use a coin toss to determine the winner of a fencing match that remains tied at the end of a " sudden death " extra minute of competition. Although in most international matches this is now done electronically by the scoring apparatus. [ citation needed ]  In the United States  Asa Lovejoy and Francis W. Pettygrove , who each owned the claim to the land that would later become Portland, Oregon , wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns of Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine ; Pettygrove won the coin flip . [12]  Scientists sometimes use coin flipping to determine the order in which they appear on the list of authors of scholarly papers . [13]  Politics [ edit ]  Australia [ edit ]  In December 2006, Australian television networks Seven and Ten , which shared the broadcasting of the 2007 AFL Season , decided who would broadcast the Grand Final with the toss of a coin. Network Ten won. [ citation needed ]  Canada [ edit ]  In some jurisdictions, a coin is flipped to decide between two candidates who poll equal number of votes in an election , or two companies tendering equal prices for a project. For example, a coin toss decided a City of Toronto tender in 2003 for painting lines on 1,605 km of city streets: the bids were $161,110.00 ($100.3800623 per km), $146,584.65 ($91.33 per km, exactly), and two equal bids of $111,242.55 ($69.31 per km, exactly).  Philippines [ edit ]  " Drawing of lots " is one of the methods to break ties to determine a winner in an election; the coin flip is considered an acceptable variant. Each candidate will be given five chances to flip a coin; the candidate with the most number of "heads" wins. The 2013 mayoral election in San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro was decided on a coin flip, with a winner being proclaimed after the second round when both candidates remained tied in the first round. [14]  United Kingdom [ edit ]  In the United Kingdom, if a local or national election has resulted in a tie where candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, then the winner can be decided either by drawing straws/lots, coin flip, or drawing a high card in pack of cards. [15] [16]  United States [ edit ]  In the United States , a coin toss determines the class of the senators of a state being added to the Union, with the new state's senators due to be entering the US Senate . [17] A number of states provide for "drawing lots" in the event an election ends in a tie - this is usually resolved by a coin toss or picking names from a hat. [18] A 2017 election to the 94th District of the Virginia House of Delegates resulted in both Republican incumbent David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds tied with exactly 11,608 votes. Under state law, the election was to be decided by drawing a name from a bowl, although a coin toss would also have been an acceptable option. The chair of the Board of Elections drew the film canister with Yancey's name, and he was declared the winner. [19] Additionally, the outcome of the draw determined control of the entire House, as Republicans won 50 of the other 99 seats and Democrats 49. A Yancey win extended the Republican advantage to 51-49, whereas a Simmonds win would have resulted in a 50-50 tie. As there is no provision for breaking ties in the House as a whole, this would have forced a power sharing agreement between the two parties. [20]  Physics [ edit ]  The outcome of coin flipping has been studied by Persi Diaconis and his collaborators. They have demonstrated that a mechanical coin flipper which imparts the same initial conditions for every toss has a highly predictable outcome – the phase space is fairly regular. Further, in actual flipping, people exhibit slight bias – "coin tossing is fair to two decimals but not to three. That is, typical flips show biases such as .495 or .503." [21]  In studying coin flipping, to observe the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, so that when the speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time. [21]  Moreover, their theoretical analysis of the physics of coin tosses predicts a slight bias for a caught coin to be caught the same way up as it was thrown, with a probability of around 0.51, [22] though a subsequent attempt to verify this experimentally gave ambiguous results. [23] Stage magicians and gamblers, with practice, are able to greatly increase this bias, whilst still making throws which are visually indistinguishable from normal throws. [21]  Since the images on the two sides of actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to slightly favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing. Coin spinning is much more likely to be biased than flipping, and conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.  Counterintuitive properties [ edit ]  Human intuition about conditional probability is often very poor and can give rise to some seemingly surprising observations. For example, if the successive tosses of a coin are recorded as a string of "H" and "T", then for any trial of tosses, it is twice as likely that the triplet TTH will occur before THT than after it. It is three times as likely that THH will precede HHT, than that THH will follow HHT. [24] (See Penney's game )  Mathematics [ edit ]  The mathematical abstraction of the statistics of coin flipping is described by means of the Bernoulli process ; a single flip of a coin is a Bernoulli trial . In the study of statistics, coin-flipping plays the role of being an introductory example of the complexities of statistics. A commonly treated textbook topic is that of checking if a coin is fair .  Telecommunications [ edit ]  Further information: Commitment scheme  There is no reliable way to use a true coin flip to settle a dispute between two parties if they cannot both see the coin—for example, over the phone. The flipping party could easily lie about the outcome of the toss. In telecommunications and cryptography , the following algorithm can be used:   Alice and Bob each choose a random string, "ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd" and "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" respectively.  Alice chooses an outcome for an imaginary coin flip, such as "tail"  Bob sends Alice his random string "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd"  Alice immediately computes a cryptographic hash of the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd", which is 59dea408d43183a3937957e71a4bcacc616d9cbc and sends it to Bob  Alice asks Bob: "heads or tails"?  Bob says, for instance, "heads".  Alice tells him she's just won, and proves it by showing the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd".  Bob can check that Alice didn't lie by computing the SHA-1 of the string himself  Furthermore, Bob by providing his own randomly generated string guarantees that Alice wasn't able to precompute an image pair of "tail/random string" or "head/random string".   Lotteries [ edit ]  The New Zealand  lottery game Big Wednesday uses a coin toss. If a player matches all 6 of their numbers, the coin toss will decide whether they win a cash jackpot (minimum of NZ$25,000) or a bigger jackpot with luxury prizes (minimum of NZ$2 million cash, plus value of luxury prizes.) The coin toss is also used in determining the Second Chance winner's prize.  Clarifying feelings [ edit ]  A technique attributed to Sigmund Freud to help in making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I want you to do is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." [25]  Danish poet Piet Hein 's book Grooks includes a poem on a similar theme:   A Psychological Tip  Whenever you're called on to make up your mind, And you're hampered by not having any, The best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find, Is simply by spinning a penny. No—not so that chance shall decide the affair While you're passively standing there moping; But the moment the penny is up in the air, You suddenly know what you're hoping.

nature.  A subject repeatedly attempts a task with a known probability
of success due to chance, then the number of actual successes is compared
to the chance expectation.  If a subject scores consistently higher or
lower than the chance expectation after a large number of attempts,
one can calculate the probability of such a score due purely to
chance, and then argue, if the chance probability is sufficiently
small, that the results are evidence for the existence of some
mechanism (precognition, telepathy, psychokinesis, cheating, etc.)
which allowed the subject to perform better than chance would seem to
permit.  Suppose you ask a subject to guess, before it is flipped, whether a
coin will land with heads or tails up.  Assuming the coin is fair (has
the same probability of heads and tails), the chance of guessing
correctly is 50%, so you'd expect half the guesses to be correct and
half to be wrong.  So, if we ask the subject to guess heads or tails
for each of 100 coin flips, we'd expect about 50 of the guesses to be
correct.  Suppose a new subject walks into the lab and manages to
guess heads or tails correctly for 60 out of 100 tosses.  Evidence of
precognition, or perhaps the subject's possessing a telekinetic power
which causes the coin to land with the guessed face up?  Well,…no.
In all likelihood, we've observed nothing more than good luck.  The
probability of 60 correct guesses out of 100 is about 2.8%, which
means that if we do a large number of experiments flipping 100 coins,
about every 35 experiments we can expect a score of 60 or better,
purely due to chance.  But suppose this subject continues to guess about 60 right
out of a hundred, so that after ten runs of 100 tosses—1000
tosses in all, the subject has made 600 correct guesses.
The probability of that happening purely by chance is less
than one in seven billion, so it's time to start thinking
about explanations other than luck.  Still, improbable things
happen all the time: if you hit a golf ball, the odds it
will land on a given blade of grass are millions to one, yet
(unless it ends up in the lake or a sand trap) it is
certain to land on some blades of grass.  Finally, suppose this “dream subject” continues to guess 60%
of the flips correctly, observed by multiple video cameras,
under conditions prescribed by skeptics and debunkers, using
a coin provided and flipped by The Amazing Randi himself, with
a final tally of 1200 correct guesses in 2000 flips.  You'd
have to try the 2000 flips more than 5×10 18 times before you'd expect that result to occur by chance.
If it takes a day to do 2000 guesses and coin flips, it
would take more than 1.3×10 16 years of
2000 flips per day before you'd expect to see 1200 correct
guesses due to chance.  That's more than a million times
the age of the universe, so you'd better get started soon!  Claims of evidence for the paranormal are usually based upon
statistics which diverge so far from the expectation due to chance
that some other mechanism seems necessary to explain the experimental
results.  To interpret the results of our RetroPsychoKinesis
experiments, we'll be using the mathematics of probability and
statistics, so it's worth spending some time explaining how we go
about quantifying the consequences of chance.     Note to mathematicians: The following discussion of probability
is deliberately simplified to consider only binomial and normal distributions
with a probability of 0.5, the presumed probability of success in
the experiments in question.  I decided that
presenting and discussing the equations for arbitrary probability
would only decrease the probability that readers would persevere
and arrive at an understanding of the fundamentals of probability
theory.    Twelve and a half cents: one bit!  In slang harking back to the days of gold doubloons and pieces of
eight, the United States quarter-dollar coin is nicknamed “two bits”.
The Fourmilab radioactive random
number generator produces a stream of binary ones and zeroes, or bits .  Since we expect the generator to produce ones and
zeroes with equal probability, each bit from the generator is
equivalent to a coin flip: heads for one and tails for zero.  When we run
experiments with the generator, in effect, we're flipping a binary coin , one bit —twelve and a
half cents!     Two Bits    One Bit            Heads  Tails    Heads  Tails     (We could, of course, have called zero heads and one tails; since both
occur with equal probability, the choice is arbitrary.) Each bit
produced by the random number generator is a flip of our one-bit coin.
Now the key thing to keep in mind about a genuine random number
generator or flip of a fair coin is that it has no memory or,
as mathematicians say, each bit from the generator or flip is independent .  Even if, by chance, the coin has come up heads
ten times in a row, the probability of getting heads or tails on the
next flip is precisely equal.  Gamblers who've seen a coin come up
heads ten times in a row may believe “tails is way overdue”, but the
coin doesn't know and couldn't care less about the last ten flips; the
next flip is just as likely to be the eleventh head in a row as the
tail that breaks the streak.  Even though there is no way whatsoever to predict the outcome of the
next flip, if we flip a coin a number of times, the laws of
probability allow us to predict, with greater accuracy as the number
of flips increases, the probability of obtaining various results.  In
the discussion that follows, we'll ignore the order of the flips and
only count how many times the coin came up heads.  Since heads is one
and tails is zero, we can just add up the results from the flips, or
the bits from the random generator.  Four Flips  Suppose we flip a coin four times.  Since each flip can come up heads
or tails, there are 16 possible outcomes, tabulated below, grouped by
the number of heads in the four flips.     Number of Heads  Results of Flips  Number of Ways    0       1    1                       4    2                                 6    3                       4    4       1      Number of Ways summarises how many different ways the results
of the four flips could end up with a given number of heads.  Since
the only way to get zero heads is for all four flips to be tails,
there's only one way that can occur.  One head out of four flips can
happen four different ways since each of the four flips could have
been the head.  Two heads out of four flips can happen six different
ways, as tabulated.  And since what's true of heads applies equally to
tails, there are four ways to get three heads and one way to get four.  Mathematically, the number of ways to get x heads (or tails) in n flips is spoken of as
the “number of combinations of n things taken x at a time”, which is written as:     This, it turns out, can be calculated for any positive integers n and x whatsoever, as follows.     For example, if we plug in 4 for n and 2 for x ,
we get  4! / (2! (4 − 2)!) = 4! / (2! 2!) = 24 / (2 2) = 24 / 4 = 6  as expected.
Plotting the number of ways we can get different numbers of
heads yields the following graph.     Probability  Since the coin is fair, each flip has an equal chance of coming up
heads or tails, so all 16 possible outcomes tabulated above are
equally probable.  But since there are 6 ways to get 2 heads, in four
flips the probability of two heads is greater than that of
any other result.  We express probability as a number between 0 and 1.
A probability of zero is a result which cannot ever occur: the
probability of getting five heads in four flips is zero.  A
probability of one represents certainty: if you flip a coin, the
probability you'll get heads or tails is one (assuming it
can't land on the rim,  fall into a black hole, or some such).  The probability of getting a given number of heads from
four flips is, then, simply the number of ways that
number of heads can occur, divided by the number of total
results of four flips, 16.  We can then tabulate the
probabilities as follows.     Number of Heads  Number of Ways  Probability    0  1  1/16 = 0.0625    1  4  4/16 = 0.25    2  6  6/16 = 0.375    3  4  4/16 = 0.25    4  1  1/16 = 0.0625     Since we are absolutely certain the number of heads we get in four
flips is going to be between zero and four, the probabilities of the
different numbers of heads should add up to 1.  Summing the
probabilities in the table confirms this.  Further, we can calculate
the probability of any collection of results by adding the individual
probabilities of each.  Suppose we'd like to know the probability of
getting fewer than three heads from four flips.  There are three ways
this can happen: zero, one, or two heads.  The probability of fewer
than three, then, is the sum of the probabilities of these results,
1/16 + 4/16 + 6/16 = 11/16 = 0.6875, or a little more than two out of
three.  So to calculate the probability of one outcome or another, sum the probabilities.  To get probability of one result and another from two
separate experiments, multiply the individual
probabilities.  The probability of getting one head in four flips is
4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25.  What's the probability of getting one head in each
of two successive sets of four flips?  Well, it's just 1/4 × 1/4 =
1/16 = 0.0625.  The probability for any number of heads x in
any number of flips n is thus:     the number of ways in which x heads can occur
in n flips, divided by the number of different possible
results of the series of flips, measured by number of heads.
But there's no need to sum the combinations in the denominator,
since the number of possible results is simply two raised
to the power of the number of flips.  So, we can simplify
the expression for the probability to:     More Flips  Let's see how the probability behaves as we make more and more flips.
Since we have a general formula for calculating the probability for
any number of heads in any number of flips, we can graph of the
probability for various numbers of flips.   8 Flips  16 Flips  32 Flips  64 Flips  128 Flips   In every case, the peak probability is at half the number of flips and
declines on both sides, more steeply as the number of flips increases.
This is the simple consequence of there being many more possible ways
for results close to half heads and tails to occur than ways that
result in a substantial majority of heads or tails.
The RPKP experiments involve a sequence of 1024
random bits, in which the most probable results form a narrow
curve centred at 512.  A document giving
probabilities for results of 1024 bit experiments with
chance expectations greater than one in 100 thousand million
runs is available , as is a much
larger table listing probabilities for
all possible results .  (The latter document is more than 150K bytes
and will take a while to download, and contains a very large
table which some Web browsers, particularly on machines with
limited memory, may not display properly.)  Perfectly Normal  As we make more and more flips, the graph of the probability of a
given number of heads becomes smoother and approaches the
“bell curve”, or normal distribution , as a limit.  The
normal distribution gives the probability for x heads
in n flips as:     where μ= n /2 and
σ is the standard deviation , a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for equal probability coin flipping, is:     We keep the standard deviation separate, as opposed to merging it into
the normal distribution probability equation, because it will play an
important rôle in interpreting the results of our experiments.  To
show how closely the probability chart approaches the normal
distribution even for a relatively small number of flips, here's the
normal distribution plotted in red, with the actual probabilities for
number of heads in 128 flips shown as blue bars.     The probability the outcome of an experiment with
a sufficiently large number of trials is due to
chance can be calculated directly from the result, and
the mean and standard deviation for the number of trials
in the experiment.  For additional details, including an
interactive probability calculator, please visit
the z Score
Probability Calculator .  Calculation and Reality  This is all very persuasive, you might say, and the formulas are
suitably intimidating, but does the real world actually behave this
way?  Well, as a matter of fact, it does, as we can see from a simple
experiment.  Get a coin, flip it 32 times, and write down the number
of times heads came up.  Now repeat the experiment fifty thousand
times.  When you're done, make a graph of the number of 32-flip sets
which resulted in a given number of heads.  Hmmmm…32 times
50,000 is 1.6 million, so if you flip the coin once a second,
twenty-four hours per day, it'll take eighteen and a half days to
complete the experiment….  Instead of marathon coin-flipping, let's use the same HotBits hardware random number generator our
experiments employ.  It's a simple matter of programming to withdraw
1.6 million bits from the generator, divide them up into 50,000 sets
of 32 bits each, then compute a histogram of the number of sets
containing each possible number of one bits (heads).  The results from
this experiment are presented in the following graph.     The red curve is the number of runs expected to result in each value
of heads, which is simply the probability of that number of heads
multiplied by the total number of experimental runs, 50,000.  The blue
diamonds are the actual number of 32 bit sets observed to contain each
number of one bits.  It is evident that the experimental results
closely match the expectation from probability.  Just as the
probability curve approaches the normal distribution for large numbers
of runs, experimental results from a truly random source will
inexorably converge on the predictions of probability as the number of
runs increases.   If
your Web browser supports Java applets, our Probability Pipe
Organ lets you run interactive experiments which demonstrate how
the results from random data approach the normal
curve expectation as the number of experiments grows large.   Experiments and Expectations  Performing an experiment amounts to asking the Universe a
question.  For the answer, the experimental results, to be
of any use, you have to be absolutely sure you've phrased the
question correctly.  When searching for elusive effects
among a sea of random events by statistical means, whether
in particle physics or parapsychology, one must take care
to apply statistics properly to the events being studied.
Misinterpreting genuine experimental results yields errors
just as serious as those due to faults in the design of the
experiment.  Evidence for the existence of a phenomenon must be significant , persistent , and consistent .
Statistical analysis can never entirely rule out the
possibility that the results of an experiment were entirely due to
chance—it can only calculate the probability of occurrence by
chance.  Only as more and more experiments are performed, which
reproduce the supposed effect and, by doing so, further decrease the
probability of chance, does the evidence for the effect become
persuasive.  To show how essential it is to ask the right question, consider an
experiment in which the subject attempts to influence a device which
generates random digits from 0 to 9 so that more nines are generated
than expected by chance.  Each experiment involves generation of one
thousand random digits.  We run the first experiment and get the
following result:   51866599999944246273322297520235159670265786865762

(we'll see how to calculate this numerically before long).
There was an excess of nines over the chance expectation, 100,
but greater excesses occurred for the digits 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .  But take a look at the first line of
the results!  518665 999999 44246273322297520235159670265786865762
                            .
                            .
                            .  These digits were supposed to be random , yet in the first
thousand, the first dozen for that matter, we found a pattern as
striking as “999999”.  What's the probability of that happening?  Just
the number of possible numbers of d digits which contain one
or more sequences of p or more consecutive nines:     Plugging in 1000 for d and 6 for p yields:     So the probability of finding “999999” in a set of 1000 random digits
is less than one in a thousand!  So then, are the digits not random,
after all?  Might our subject, while failing to influence the outcome
of the experiment in the way we've requested, have somehow marked the
results with a signature of a thousand-to-one probability of appearing
by chance?  Or have we simply asked the wrong question and gotten a
perfectly accurate answer that doesn't mean what we think it does at
first glance?  The latter turns out to be the case.  The data are right before our
eyes, and the probability we calculated is correct, but we asked
the wrong question , and in doing so fell into a trap littered
with the bones of many a naïve researcher.  Note the order in which we
did things.  We ran the experiment, examined the data, found something
seemingly odd in it, then calculated the probability of that
particular oddity appearing by chance.  We asked the question,
“ What is the probability of ‘999999’ appearing in a 1000 digit
random sequence? ” and got the answer “less than one in a
thousand”, a result most people would consider significant.  But since
we calculated the probability after seeing the data, in fact we were
asking the question “ What is the chance that ‘999999’ appears in a
1000 digit random sequence which contains one occurrence of
‘999999’?” .  The answer to that question is, of course,
“certainty”.  In the original examination of the data, we were really asking
“ What is the probability we'll find some striking sequence
of six digits in a random 1000 digit number? ”.  We can't
precisely quantify that without defining what “striking” means to the
observer, but it is clearly quite high.  Consider that I could have
made the case just as strongly for “000000”, “777777” or any other
six-digit repeat.  That alone reduces the probability of occurrence by
chance to one in ten.  Or, perhaps I might have pointed out a run of
digits like “123456”, “012345”, “987654”, and so on; or the first five
or six digits of a mathematical constant such as Pi, e, or the square
root of two; regular patterns like “101010”, “123321”, or a multitude
of others; or maybe my telephone or license plate number, or the
subject's!  It is, in fact, very likely you'll find some pattern you consider striking in a random 1000-digit number.  But, of course, if you don't examine the data from an experiment, how
are you going to notice if there's something odd about it?  Now we'll
see how a hypothesis is framed, tested by a series of experiments, and
confirmed or rejected by statistical analysis of the results.  So,
let's pursue this a bit further, exploring how we frame a hypothesis
based on an observation, run experiments to test it, and then analyse the
results to determine whether they confirm or
deny the hypothesis, and to what degree of certainty.  Our observation, based on examining the first thousand random digits,
is that “999999” appears once, while the probability of “999999”
appearing in a randomly chosen 1000 digit number is less than one in a
thousand.  Based on this observation we then suggest:    Hypothesis:  The sequence “999999” appears more frequently
in 1000-digit sequences with the subject attempting to influence
the generator than would be expected by chance.    We can now proceed to test this experimentally.  If the sequence
“999999” has a probability of occurring in a 1000 digit sequence of
0.000995, then for a thousand consecutive 1000 digit sequences (a
million digits in all), the probability of “999999” appearing will
be 0.995, almost unity. (To be correct, it's important
to test each 1000 digit sequence separately, then sum the results for
1000 consecutive sequences.  If we were to scan all million digits as
one sequence, we would count cases where the sequence “999999” begins
in one 1000 digit sequence and ends in the next.  The probability
(which you can calculate from the equation above) of finding “999999”
in a million digit sequence is 0.999995, somewhat higher than the
0.995 with the million digits are treated as separate 1000 digit
experiments.)   We will perform, then, the following experiment.  With our
ever-patient subject continuing to attempt to influence the output of the
generator, we will produce a million more sequences
of 1000 digits and, in each, count occurrences of “999999”.  Every
1000 sequences, we'll record the number of occurrences,
repeating the process until we've generated a thousand
runs of a million digits—10 9 digits in all.
With that data in hand, we'll see whether the “999999 effect”
is genuine or a fluke attributable to chance.  Here is a plot of the number of occurrences of the sequence “999999”
per block of 1000 digits over the thousand repetitions of the thousand
sequence experiment.  The number of occurrences expected by chance,
0.995, is marked by the green line.     At the outset, the results diverged substantially from chance, as is
frequently the case for small sample sizes.  But as the number of
experiments increased, the results converged toward the chance
expectation, ending up in a decreasing magnitude random walk around
it.  This is precisely what is expected from probability theory, and
hence we conclude no “999999 effect” exists.  Ensembles of Experiments: the X ² (Chi-Square) Test  So far, we've seen how the laws of probability predict the outcome of
large numbers of experiments involving random data, how to calculate
the probability of a given experimental result being due to chance,
and how one goes about framing a hypothesis, then designing and
running a series of experiments to test it.  Now it's time to examine
how to analyse the results from the experiments to determine whether
they provide evidence for the hypothesis and, if so, how much.  Since its introduction in 1900 by Karl Peterson, the chi-square
( X ²) test has become the most widely used measure of the
significance to which experimental results support or refute a
hypothesis.  Applicable to any experiment where discrete results can
be measured, it is used in almost every field of science.  The
chi-square test is the final step in a process which usually proceeds
as follows.   Based either on theory or examination of empirical
        data, a phenomenon is suggested to exist.  A hypothesis is framed incorporating the supposed
        phenomenon.  An experiment is designed to test the hypothesis.
        The experiment must produce results which differ
        based on the validity of the hypothesis.  The
        results of the experiment for the hypothesis-false
        ( null hypothesis ) case are calculated and,
        if appropriate, verified by a control experiment
        in which the hypothesised effect is excluded.  A series of experiments are conducted, and the
        results tabulated.  The chi-square test is applied to determine the
        significance of the discrepancy between the
        calculated null hypothesis case and the
        experimental results, and the probability that
        the discrepancy is the result of chance.  If
        that probability is very low, the experiment
        provides evidence for the hypothesis.   No experiment or series of experiments can ever prove a
hypothesis; one can only rule out other hypotheses and provide
evidence that assuming the truth of the hypothesis better explains the
experimental results than discarding it.  In many fields of science,
the task of estimating the null-hypothesis results can be formidable,
and can lead to prolonged and intricate arguments about the
assumptions involved.  Experiments must be carefully designed to
exclude selection effects which might bias the data.  Fortunately, retropsychokinesis experiments have an easily stated and
readily calculated null hypothesis: “The results will obey the
statistics for a sequence of random bits.” The fact that the data are
prerecorded guarantees (assuming the experiment software is properly
implemented and the results are presented without selection or
modification) that run selection or other forms of cheating cannot
occur.  (Anybody can score better than chance at coin flipping if
they're allowed to throw away experiments that come out poorly!)
Finally, the availability of all the programs in source code form and
the ability of others to repeat the experiments on their own premises
will allow independent confirmation of the results obtained here.  So, as the final step in analysing the results of a collection of n experiments, each with k possible outcomes, we
apply the chi-square test to compare the actual results with the
results expected by chance, which are just, for each outcome, its
probability times the number of experiments n .  Mathematically,
the chi-square statistic for an experiment with k possible outcomes, performed n times, in which Y 1 , Y 2 ,… Y k are the number of
experiments which resulted in each possible outcome, where the
probabilities of each outcome are p 1 ,
p 2 ,… p k is:     It's evident from examining this equation that the closer the
measured values are to those expected, the
lower the chi-square sum will be.  Further, from a chi-square
sum, the probability Q that the X ² sum for an experiment with d degrees of freedom (where d = k −1, one less
the number of possible outcomes) is consistent with the
null hypothesis can be calculated as:     Where Γ is the generalisation of the factorial
function to real and complex arguments:     Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for Q , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  If your Web browser supports
JavaScript, you can use the Chi-Square
Calculator to calculate the probability from a chi-square value
and number of possible outcomes, or calculate the chi-square from the
probability and the number of possible outcomes.  In applying the chi-square test, it's essential to understand that only
very small probabilities of the null hypothesis are significant.
If the probability that the null hypothesis can explain the experimental
results is above 1%, an experiment is generally not considered evidence
of a different hypothesis.  The chi-square test takes
into account neither the number of experiments performed nor the
probability distribution of the expected outcomes; it is valid
only as the number of experiments becomes large, resulting in
substantial numbers for the most probable results.  If a hypothesis
is valid, the chi-square probability should converge on a
small value as more and more experiments are run.  Now let's examine an example of how the chi-square test identifies
experimental results which support or refute a hypothesis.  Our
simulated experiment consists of 50,000 runs of 32 random bits each.
The subject attempts to influence the random number generator to emit
an excess of one or zero bits compared to the chance expectation of
equal numbers of zeroes and ones.  The following table gives the
result of a control run using the random number generator without the
subject's attempting to influence it.  Even if the probability of
various outcomes is easily calculated, it's important to run control
experiments to make sure there are no errors in the experimental
protocol or apparatus which might bias the results away from those
expected.  The table below gives, for each possible number of one
bits, the number of runs which resulted in that count, the expectation
from probability, and the corresponding term in the chi-square sum.
The chi-square sum for the experiment is given at the bottom.

(32, one less than the 33 possible outcomes of the experiment)
into the Chi-Square Calculator gives a probability of 0.85.  This falls within the “fat region” of the
probability curve, and thus supports the null hypothesis, just as we
expected.  Next, we invite our subject to attempt to influence the random output
of our generator.  How? Hypotheses non
fingo. Let's just presume that by some means: telekinesis,
voodoo, tampering with the apparatus when we weren't
looking—whatever, our subject is able to bias the generator so
that out of every 200 bits there's an average of 101 one bits and 99

an experiment with 33 possible outcomes (32 degrees of freedom)
has a probability of occurring by chance of 0.00000022—about
two in ten million—a highly significant result, worthy of
follow-up experiments and investigation of possible mechanisms which
might explain the deviation from chance.

New study shows how guessing heads or tails isn't really a 50-50 game  By Daily Mail Reporter    Published: 12:59 EDT, 2 December 2012 |  Updated: 13:00 EDT, 2 December 2012  [headerlinks  You don’t need to be a mathematician or a Vegas card shark to know that, when all things are equal, the probability of flipping a coin and guessing which side lands up correctly is 50-50. But what most people seem to forget, or so says Stanford math professor Persi Diaconis, is that things are almost never equal. In reality, the odds of guessing heads or tails correctly aren’t as even as you might think, and the reason has much more to do with physics than probability. According to Diaconis, a natural bias
 
occurs when coins are flipped, which results in the side that was 
originally facing up returning to that same position 51 per cent of the 
time. This means that if a coin is flipped with its heads side facing up, it will land the same way 51 out of 100 times.       Beating the Odds: Stanford professor Persi Diaconis, pictured, has determined that a flipped coin is more likely to end up facing the same direction as when it was first tossed than not.  Diaconis came to this conclusion after determining that no matter how hard a coin is flipped, the side that started up will spend more time facing up most of the time.  One way of thinking about this, as 
noted in an article from Coding Wheel, is to look at the ratio of even 
and odd numbers starting from one. What you'll discover is that no 
matter what number you stop at, there will never be more even numbers 
than odd numbers in that sequence.    RELATED ARTICLES   Previous  1  Next        Strong sense of smell is the key to a happy and lasting...

Share this article  Share     The coin flips work in much the same way.  Diaconis first realized that coin flips were not random after he and his colleagues managed to rig a coin-flipping machine to get a coin to land heads every time.      Making a Bet: Specifically, a coin will land with its initial face up 51 per cent of the time. He and his team then asked humans subjects do the same thing over and over, recording the results with a high speed camera. Though the results were a little more random, they still ended up with the 51-49 per cent margin. Diaconis noted that the randomness is attributed to the fact that when humans flip coins, there are a number of different motions the coin is likely to make. For instance, he showed how coins don’t 
just move end to end, but also in a circular motion, like a tossed 
pizza. He
 also found that there are ways to flip a coin where it looks like it is
 tumbling in the air, but in reality, it doesn’t move at all. Diaconis 
proved this by tying a ribbon to a coin and showing how in four of 10 
cases the ribbon would remain flat after the coin was caught. Still in the long run, his theory still held to be true. And while the 
margin is relatively small, it’s enough to maybe get you reconsidering 
using a coin toss to settle your next argument. In another startling discover, Diaconis determined that the probability of guessing which side comes up of a spinning penny is also skewed more in one direction. According to Diaconis’ research, a spinning penny will land tails side up roughly 80 per cent of the time. This is because the heads side of the penny, the one with the portrait of Abraham Lincoln on it, is slightly heavier than the tail side., This causes the coin’s center of mass to lie more toward the head side than the tail. So when it is spun, the penny will naturally fall toward its heavier size, which means there is considerably higher chance that it will land with the tail side up. Diaconis did warn that an older penny may pick up dirt and oils over times that could sway the direction it lands in one way or another, but a relatively new coin should land tails side up more. A magician in his spare time, Diaconis is well known for his work with probability. He was famous for discovering that it requires either five of seven shuffles, depending on the criteria, to get a deck of cards into a mathematically random order. Diaconis said that his next step is figuring out what effects randomizing factors, like letting a flipped coin drop first, affects his latest theory.
