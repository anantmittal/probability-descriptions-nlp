What had to happen in order for everything to come together so you could exist? Subscribe: https://youtube.com/c/allourquestions... It's mind blowing to think about all of the things that had to be in place for you to be born. Just from the beginning of the Earth an immeasurable amount of events have taken place to bring you into existence. For example, the chances of your mother meeting your father and staying together long enough to have a child is slim. Multiply that by every person in your family tree all the way back to the first living organism. In addition to the obvious variables of the parents, you also have the chances of the Earth being in the right location in the universe and having the right environment that would last long enough to give you life. People have figured out vague numbers of the odds of your existence but in reality, there are too many variables to really nail down any exact odds because in calculating the odds there always has to be a starting point and the odds of that starting point being there are also immeasurable. Whatever the odds of you being born...you...remember that your existence is an amazing accomplishment against uncountable odds. Do something cool with it.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don’t matter. The fact you’re alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you…   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let’s remember there are people out there that can’t eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don’t feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that “it” may be. Unfortunately, people aren’t grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don’t have. When you see regret in a person’s eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn’t. No matter the shit hand you’re dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don’t care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you’re actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

What are the odds?  What are the odds that you exist, as you, today? Author Ali Binazir attemps to quantify the probability that you came about and exist as you today, and reveals that the odds of you existing are almost zero.  LET'S START SMALL What is the probability of your dad meeting your mom? Though the world was smaller 20 years ago, your dad could have met almost 200 million of its women (go dad!) But over 25 years, he probably met around 10,000 women. So the odds that your mom was in this small group and met your dad is: 1 in 20,000  BUT WE KNOW HOW TRICKY LOVE CAN BE. What is the probability that they stay together long enough to have kids? It is a 1 in 10 chance that they talk to each other. Also a 1 in 10 chance that they go on a second date. Another 1 in 10 chance that they keep dating for a while. And a coin toss if they stay together long enough for offspring. Thus, the odds that your parents' meeting results in kids is: 1 in 2,000  So far, the combines odds of you being here are: 1 in 40,000,000 That is about the size of the population of California.  NOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET PRETTY INTERESTING Why? Because we are about to deal with eggs and sperm, which come in large numbers. Mom has about 100,000 eggs in her lifetime. Dad makes about 4 trillion sperm during the years you could have been born.  What are the odds that the 1 egg... (Sally)... ...met the 1 sperm, which together made you(and not your brother)? (Harry) 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 400 quadrillion)That is approximately the volume in cubic meters of the Atlantic Ocean (3,236x10 17 cubic meters).  BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED Because your existence here, now, and on planet earth presupposes another supremely unlikely and utterly undeniable chain of events. Namely, that every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age- going all the way back not just to the first Homo sapiens, first Homo erectus and Homo habilis, but all the way back to the first single-celled organism. You are a representative of an unbroken lineage of life going back 4 billion years.  What are the odds that you lineage remained unbroken for the length of human existence? (You.Aw.) 1 in 2 odds that a child will be born, grow, and reproduce per generation... ... for 150,000 generations  1 in 10  45,000 That's a 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it.  How large is that number? That number is not just larger than all the particles in the universe-it is larger that all the particles in the universe if each particle were itself a universe.  THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. The right sperm also had to meet the right egg for every single one of those ancestors.  (Weeeee!) ODDS OF THE RIGHT SPERM, MEETING THE RIGHT EGG 150,000 TIMES? 1 in 10 2,640,000 That is 1 quadrillion multiplied by 1 quadrillion for every generation.  Let's add it all up  10 2,640,000 x 10 45,000 x 2000 x 20,000= 1 in 10 2,685,000  BY COMPARISON: The number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg. 175 lb) is about: 10 27 The number of atoms making up the earth is about: 10 50 The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at: 10 80  THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: It is the probability of 2 million people getting together (about the population of San Diego) each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up with the exact same number-for example, 550,343,279,001.  SO, THE ODDS THAT YOU EXIST AT ALL ARE: BASICALLY ZERO.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, we have just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and ac like the miracle that you are.

Seems a bit unlikely...   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  16 points 17 points 18 points  3 years ago *  (2 children) I think the odds are correct, they're just not meaningful in the way they're framing them.  What they're saying is not that the odds of a person being born are so small, it's that the odds of a person being born in exactly the way that you were are very low. But this is kind of a pointless statement, because they would be saying the exact same thing about you if you were born a completely different way.  It's like saying, aren't you glad that all these things happened that you didn't choose and that if you could have chosen you might have chosen differently?  You're the descendant of thousands of rapists, murderers, thieves, and prostitutes. Congratulations.   permalink embed save parent [–] anon8609  5 points 6 points 7 points  3 years ago  (1 child) To paraphrase: What this chart is illustrating are the odds that you have the exact parents that you do. Not that you actually exist, but that you exist with your exact parents, in your exact town, etc. .   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Precisely. It's a hugely flawed way to calculate it, especially when simple measurement of distance compared with the age of the universe alone should be enough to demonstrate that you being in this spot at this moment, alive (having just a 100yr or so lifespan) is ridiculously low.   permalink embed save parent [–] cantwaittogoback  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (1 child) I'm gonna guess number of sperm taking into account how difficult it is to get pregnant for a lot if people   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] arturenault  3 points 4 points 5 points  3 years ago  (0 children) The infographic actually explains it quite well. But it's kind of a weird statement in the first place. It doesn't really matter how likely you were that you were born, because you would have to be born to ponder it. Somebody was going to have your place, but none of the 10 2,685,000 other candidates were ever around to "lose" in the first place.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] bazite [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children)  Seems a bit unlikely...

What had to happen in order for everything to come together so you could exist? Subscribe: https://youtube.com/c/allourquestions... It's mind blowing to think about all of the things that had to be in place for you to be born. Just from the beginning of the Earth an immeasurable amount of events have taken place to bring you into existence. For example, the chances of your mother meeting your father and staying together long enough to have a child is slim. Multiply that by every person in your family tree all the way back to the first living organism. In addition to the obvious variables of the parents, you also have the chances of the Earth being in the right location in the universe and having the right environment that would last long enough to give you life. People have figured out vague numbers of the odds of your existence but in reality, there are too many variables to really nail down any exact odds because in calculating the odds there always has to be a starting point and the odds of that starting point being there are also immeasurable. Whatever the odds of you being born...you...remember that your existence is an amazing accomplishment against uncountable odds. Do something cool with it.

What had to happen in order for everything to come together so you could exist? Subscribe: https://youtube.com/c/allourquestions... It's mind blowing to think about all of the things that had to be in place for you to be born. Just from the beginning of the Earth an immeasurable amount of events have taken place to bring you into existence. For example, the chances of your mother meeting your father and staying together long enough to have a child is slim. Multiply that by every person in your family tree all the way back to the first living organism. In addition to the obvious variables of the parents, you also have the chances of the Earth being in the right location in the universe and having the right environment that would last long enough to give you life. People have figured out vague numbers of the odds of your existence but in reality, there are too many variables to really nail down any exact odds because in calculating the odds there always has to be a starting point and the odds of that starting point being there are also immeasurable. Whatever the odds of you being born...you...remember that your existence is an amazing accomplishment against uncountable odds. Do something cool with it.

The more technical this world becomes, the more obsessed we become with our phones, our status, our money, the less we realize how great we really have it. The vast majority of people bitch and moan about things that don’t matter. The fact you’re alive, healthy, and able to work is literally a miracle. Do you realize what has to happen for you to be born, and the chances you came out as you? The odds of you being born as you are about 1 in 400 trillion, or more . Take a second and think about that, and put a smile on your face, you fucking miracle you…   While we punch our desks for slow internet connection or a lousy hair day, let’s remember there are people out there that can’t eat, live under a bridge, die of disease, and will never know a life of prosperity.  Every year you age, you get wiser, even if you don’t feel it, or see it. You might be 30 and still lost, you might be 22 and think your life sucks. You have a choice, literally, to choose to be happy. To choose positivity. The one thing you have control over is hustle. If you want it, hustle, get it. Whatever that “it” may be. Unfortunately, people aren’t grateful like they used to be. And if we could be more grateful, you naturally become happier, and even more grateful for things to come. You woke up this morning? Be happy. Smile and be grateful.  A guy I look up to, Gary Vaynerchuk, talks often about regret. He says to go to a nursing home, and talk to folks in their 90s and look at the regret in their eyes. The wish that they had tried to start that business, to talk to their parents more, to laugh more, to spend more quality time with the people they love, to not sweat the small stuff, but to appreciate all you have, and even appreciate all you don’t have. When you see regret in a person’s eyes as death approaches, you see the realest version of pain.  Regardless of how difficult a time you may be going through, realize someone out there is going through more. Regardless of how hard you work, realize someone is working harder to take if from you. Life is fucking beautiful, even when it isn’t. No matter the shit hand you’re dealt, find the silver lining. Find the avenue in that tumultuous road to make it out better than you started. If you work hard, and treat people the right way good things will happen. I don’t care what it is you believe in; whether that be God, or karma, or aliens, working hard and treating people the right way will always have you getting to where you want to be. That goes for work, and relationships.  So, since you now know you’re actually a miracle, grab life by the balls and make it your bitch.  425 SHARES SHARE TWEET        Tags  Lifestyle        The Official Whiskey Riff Shop   Trending  Grilled Fireball Pineapple Is About To Be Your New Favorite Side Dish This Spring & Summer...

What are the odds?  What are the odds that you exist, as you, today? Author Ali Binazir attemps to quantify the probability that you came about and exist as you today, and reveals that the odds of you existing are almost zero.  LET'S START SMALL What is the probability of your dad meeting your mom? Though the world was smaller 20 years ago, your dad could have met almost 200 million of its women (go dad!) But over 25 years, he probably met around 10,000 women. So the odds that your mom was in this small group and met your dad is: 1 in 20,000  BUT WE KNOW HOW TRICKY LOVE CAN BE. What is the probability that they stay together long enough to have kids? It is a 1 in 10 chance that they talk to each other. Also a 1 in 10 chance that they go on a second date. Another 1 in 10 chance that they keep dating for a while. And a coin toss if they stay together long enough for offspring. Thus, the odds that your parents' meeting results in kids is: 1 in 2,000  So far, the combines odds of you being here are: 1 in 40,000,000 That is about the size of the population of California.  NOW THINGS ARE GOING TO GET PRETTY INTERESTING Why? Because we are about to deal with eggs and sperm, which come in large numbers. Mom has about 100,000 eggs in her lifetime. Dad makes about 4 trillion sperm during the years you could have been born.  What are the odds that the 1 egg... (Sally)... ...met the 1 sperm, which together made you(and not your brother)? (Harry) 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 400 quadrillion)That is approximately the volume in cubic meters of the Atlantic Ocean (3,236x10 17 cubic meters).  BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED Because your existence here, now, and on planet earth presupposes another supremely unlikely and utterly undeniable chain of events. Namely, that every one of your ancestors lived to reproductive age- going all the way back not just to the first Homo sapiens, first Homo erectus and Homo habilis, but all the way back to the first single-celled organism. You are a representative of an unbroken lineage of life going back 4 billion years.  What are the odds that you lineage remained unbroken for the length of human existence? (You.Aw.) 1 in 2 odds that a child will be born, grow, and reproduce per generation... ... for 150,000 generations  1 in 10  45,000 That's a 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it.  How large is that number? That number is not just larger than all the particles in the universe-it is larger that all the particles in the universe if each particle were itself a universe.  THAT'S PRETTY BIG, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. The right sperm also had to meet the right egg for every single one of those ancestors.  (Weeeee!) ODDS OF THE RIGHT SPERM, MEETING THE RIGHT EGG 150,000 TIMES? 1 in 10 2,640,000 That is 1 quadrillion multiplied by 1 quadrillion for every generation.  Let's add it all up  10 2,640,000 x 10 45,000 x 2000 x 20,000= 1 in 10 2,685,000  BY COMPARISON: The number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg. 175 lb) is about: 10 27 The number of atoms making up the earth is about: 10 50 The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at: 10 80  THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: It is the probability of 2 million people getting together (about the population of San Diego) each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up with the exact same number-for example, 550,343,279,001.  SO, THE ODDS THAT YOU EXIST AT ALL ARE: BASICALLY ZERO.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, we have just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and ac like the miracle that you are.

Seems a bit unlikely...   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  16 points 17 points 18 points  3 years ago *  (2 children) I think the odds are correct, they're just not meaningful in the way they're framing them.  What they're saying is not that the odds of a person being born are so small, it's that the odds of a person being born in exactly the way that you were are very low. But this is kind of a pointless statement, because they would be saying the exact same thing about you if you were born a completely different way.  It's like saying, aren't you glad that all these things happened that you didn't choose and that if you could have chosen you might have chosen differently?  You're the descendant of thousands of rapists, murderers, thieves, and prostitutes. Congratulations.   permalink embed save parent [–] anon8609  5 points 6 points 7 points  3 years ago  (1 child) To paraphrase: What this chart is illustrating are the odds that you have the exact parents that you do. Not that you actually exist, but that you exist with your exact parents, in your exact town, etc. .   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Precisely. It's a hugely flawed way to calculate it, especially when simple measurement of distance compared with the age of the universe alone should be enough to demonstrate that you being in this spot at this moment, alive (having just a 100yr or so lifespan) is ridiculously low.   permalink embed save parent [–] cantwaittogoback  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (1 child) I'm gonna guess number of sperm taking into account how difficult it is to get pregnant for a lot if people   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] arturenault  3 points 4 points 5 points  3 years ago  (0 children) The infographic actually explains it quite well. But it's kind of a weird statement in the first place. It doesn't really matter how likely you were that you were born, because you would have to be born to ponder it. Somebody was going to have your place, but none of the 10 2,685,000 other candidates were ever around to "lose" in the first place.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] bazite [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children)  Seems a bit unlikely...

It's similar to the question "what is the probability of life on earth?" The probability is 1.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Generic_white_person  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Surely!   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Sciphio  2 points 3 points 4 points  3 years ago  (0 children) And I'm making the most of this browsing Reddit.   permalink embed save give gold [–] KinoftheFlames  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 years ago  (5 children) I know this doesn't apply to everyone but no matter how down I get I'm always grateful that I was born in the US.   permalink embed save give gold [–] bazite [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (4 children) I was born in the UK and feel exactly the same.

We have clean water, good air, cheap and varied food, and a beautiful land. There's schools and a social system, a polite and helpful culture, and order in our cities.

What a complex little machine, pushing against entropy."  I'd have to agree. The human brain is the most complex structure we know about. Something large, like the sun, is relatively simple in organization. Something small, like DNA, have many possible variations but none as complex as the dance of neurons in a skull.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] smwilson31  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 years ago  (1 child) But what are the odds of me getting laid?   permalink embed save give gold [–] NuclearStudent  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 years ago  (0 children) All of your ancestors were sexy enough to get laid, so you have a pretty good chance.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 years ago  (0 children) I've struggled with the thought of what it means to be alive for a long time and it was holding me back in every aspect of my life.
