Politics   Jan 16, 2018 6:31 PM EDT    Let’s ignore the deja vu factor and skip right to the key question: Will the U.S. government shut down this week? The honest answer is, of course, as in the many other government shutdown scenarios of the past few years, no one can say with certainty.  But we can help gauge the odds. Here are some things that could make a shutdown more (or less) likely.  A shutdown is more likely if:   President Donald Trump’s rhetoric, including his tweets, becomes sharper.  Democrats’ rhetoric becomes sharper (and statements start flowing faster).  House Republicans exit their meeting Tuesday night openly unhappy. As it stands now, Speaker Paul Ryan needs 218 out of the 239 House Republicans to vote yes on a deal to fund the government. (Democrats insist they won’t support it without a deal on the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that protects young “Dreamers” from deportation.) But many conservatives have railed against the idea of another short-term deal. A temperature check of those Republicans will tell us a lot.  The conservative House Freedom Caucus decides to vote against a short-term spending deal. That alone could derail it.  Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell announces there is no deal or possible deal on DACA this week. That could create problems with moderate Senate Democrats needed to pass government funding.  Sen.Cory Gardner, R-Colo., breaks from the bipartisan group of six working on a DACA deal. Its prospects would dim, as would prospects for a spending deal.   A shutdown is less likely if:   The president’s rhetoric becomes less sharp. This especially includes if he says the word “bipartisan” or has warm words for Democrats.  Key Democrats and Republicans stop commenting about negotiations. This is usually a sign of progress, or a chance for progress.  McConnell announces he will allow a “test” vote on a bipartisan DACA bill.  Republicans request some other wish list item, such as postponing the medical device tax, and Democrats signal they are open to it.

By Perry Bacon Jr.  Filed under Government Shutdown    Facebook Twitter Email                  The odds of a government shutdown have gone up.  This is a fast-developing story, so stay tuned, but a bloc of Senate Democrats has shifted towards a more aggressive stance on including an immigration provision in the government funding bill, increasing the possibility that the party will block any measure that does not create some kind of program along the lines of former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals . There will be a government shutdown starting at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday if funding is not approved.  There is still some doubt over whether the House will pass a short-term funding bill. (GOP leaders are currently proposing an agreement that extends funding for one more month .) The House can pass a bill without any Democratic support, but members of the hard-to-please GOP Freedom Caucus there are balking right now . So that’s one hurdle towards avoiding a shutdown.  Another hurdle is what’s taking place in the Senate, where legislation can be stopped if it doesn’t have 60 votes. There are only 51 Republicans, and some of them are saying they don’t support a funding bill without the immigration provision either. Some Republicans are also frustrated that Congress keeps passing short-term measures. But the bigger challenge is Democrats. Even if all the Republicans vote for some kind of short-term extension, at least nine Democrats must back it.  Party activists have been imploring Democrats for months to stop supporting government funding bills that don’t replace DACA, which provided protection from deportation and work permits for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children until Trump announced he was ending it. I didn’t think , as recently as 24 hours ago, Democrats as a party were ready to take that stand.  But in the last two days, several Senate Democrats who voted for government funding bills in December even though they didn’t address DACA have said they would not do so again. That group includes Virginia’s Tim Kaine and Mark Warner , New Mexico’s Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall and New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen . And twenty-eight of the Democrats currently serving in the Senate, along with Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, have already voted against a previous funding bill that didn’t address DACA.  Some of those members could change their minds, of course, with a shutdown seeming more possible than before. But it appears that the vast majority of the 49 Senate Democrats are voting “no” on any bill that does not address DACA. So it’s worth at this point flipping the question: Who might be the nine Democrats to vote for a short-term measure with no immigration language?  Let’s start with the seven members in states Trump won who are up for reelection this year and voted in December for a funding bill without a DACA provision: Indiana’s Joe Donnelly, North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, Missouri’s Claire McCaskill, Florida’s Bill Nelson, Michigan’s Debbie Stabenow and Montana’s Jon Tester.  Then there’s Doug Jones, who as of this month represents the very red state of Alabama. He’s not up for re-election until 2020, but he has cast himself as a bipartisan senator . And Michigan’s Gary Peters, who’s up for reelection in 2020, is also from a state Trump won and has previously backed a funding bill that didn’t address DACA.  It’s these members to watch: If several of them announce they won’t vote for a funding bill without DACA either, it will be hard to avoid a shutdown.

Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images A government shutdown is looking more likely as hardliners in both parties dig in, meaning Congress may not have the votes to pass a spending bill by the end of the week. But again, it's only Wednesday, and there's going to be strong pressure to not let federal funding lapse. What we're watching: Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are saying they won't back the bill, meaning Republican leaders will need help from Democrats who say they won't offer it. The Democratic base is pressuring its members to hold the line on immigration — and get a solution to DACA included in any spending bill.

What we're hearing: One of the sources said: "Mueller's investigation has been drip, drip. This was a giant leap forward ... a personal hit. ... They were moving in inches. Today, they moved a mile." Show less Keep reading 566 Words Until now, when storms hit, Trump could turn to Hope Hicks to explain things to him, suggest wording, simmer him down. With her departure from the White House, we saw the president working out his fury in real time. The source continued: "This is the first crisis post-Hope Hicks. ... This was different: I've never seen him like this before. ... This is the president you're going to see more of from here on out: unvarnished, untethered." Another source close to Trump said: "He takes the Russia stuff as a political hit job. This was a personal affront. This was the red line" of intrusion into personal financial matters. The president — arms crossed defiantly — held a stunning on-camera venting session during an appearance with his senior military leadership where a potential strike on Syria took second billing to Michael Cohen ("With all of that being said, we are here to discuss Syria tonight"). The WashPost cites three sources as saying Cohen "is under federal investigation for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations." A statement from Cohen's lawyer, Stephen Ryan, said: "The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients." During the 10-minute rant , Trump ... ... used "disgrace" seven times and "disgraceful" twice. ... fumed about an action by agents of the government he heads: "I just heard that they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys — a good man. ... It's a total witch hunt." ...accused those agents of his government of "an attack on our country, in a true sense. It's an attack on what we all stand for." ... said, repeating back a question: "Why don't I just fire Mueller? ... Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on. We'll see what happens. But I think it's really a sad situation when you look at what happened. And many people have said, 'You should fire him." ... referred to the investigation as "the most conflicted group of people I've ever seen. The Attorney General made a terrible mistake ... when he recused himself.  ... [W]e would have ... put a different Attorney General in." ... quadrupled down on firing FBI Director James Comey: "One of the things they said: 'I fired Comey.'  Well, I turned out to do the right thing, because if you look at all of the things that he's done and the lies, and you look at what's gone on at the FBI with the insurance policy and all of the things that happened — turned out I did the right thing." Be smart: Close aides are recommending against firing Mueller. But that means little these days. The big, surreal picture : Take a minute to think about the history unfolding before our eyes. You have the president’s top lawyer getting raided by the FBI, prompting the president to warn of an epic attack on government and signaling he might try to can the special counsel investigating him. This is on the eve of the arguably most powerful and well known CEO of our generation getting grilled by Congress, in part because the Russians used his platform to try to elect the man at the center of it all. History books will be written about this — and you were there to see it all unfold.

Illustration: Lazaro Gamio/Axios One big fear about President Trump's tariff fight with China is that Beijing would retaliate by resurrecting its campaign of stealing patents, manufacturing processes and other trade secrets from U.S. companies. The Obama administration mostly shut that down in 2015. Reality check: But Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of CrowdStrike, says China didn’t wait for the latest controversy to revive its intellectual-property hacking program — it has already been ramping up efforts ever since Trump took office. “We’ve seen China expand its hacking for IP throughout 2017,” Alperovitch said. Show less Keep reading 264 Words The big picture : Until 2015 China’s state-sanctioned U.S. hacking operations regularly stole trade secrets to benefit its businesses. At that time, tech IP theft cost the U.S. economy $300 billion annually — with China responsible for 80%, according to testimony from Michelle Van Cleave of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. The Obama administration countered the threat by indicting the Chinese military hackers leading the charge in 2014 and threatening sanctions in 2015. Finally, in September 2015, China formally agreed to stop hacking the U.S. for economic espionage. “It never went entirely away, but the reductions were significant,” said Alperovitch. The current uptick, he added, appears to target tech companies, law firms and medical manufacturers. The numbers (then): FireEye, a competitor of CrowdStrike, saw a continuous decline in attacks throughout the Obama effort. Before the indictments in 2014, the company saw around 60 attacks a month targeting IP from China. After the indictments, that number dropped to under 40. With the threat of sanctions, it dropped to under 10 a month. But, said Alperovitch, Obama may have benefited from a reorganization in China underway at the time. China was physically relocating its hackers to centralize them, and also cracking down on government corruption — which may have given officials additional incentives to promote the hacking. The bottom line: Trump's tariffs are meant, in part, to counter intellectual property theft, but Alperovitch thinks the best response would be targeted sanctions. “What Xi really feared from Obama was sanctioning the companies that benefitted from the theft,” he said. “That’s still an option.” Technology                                       Benzinga Pro    Marketfy    Financial Data & APIs    Events    Premarket Prep         Membership is Free What are you waiting for?

In a new note to clients on Wednesday, Height Securities said there’s a 45-percent chance the government will shut down as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill by the deadline midnight Friday. The more likely scenario, the firm said, is that Congress will once again simply choose to kick the can down the road by extending its spending bill deadline by another month. Either way, Congress is not likely to pass a much-needed spending bill by the end of the week, Height said.  “The latest government funding bill offered by Congressional Republicans does not provide a straightforward path toward resolution by midnight this Friday, but we still think it is more likely than not enough Democrats will join Republicans to simply kick the can for four weeks (until Feb. 16) on the government funding and immigration debates,” according to Height.  Democrats and Republicans remain deeply divided on the DACA immigration debate, and Democrats are insisting the next government funding bill include money for DACA in order to snag any Democratic votes. Several fiscally conservative Republicans plan to vote against the current Republican spending bill, likely leaving its fate in the hands of Democrats.  “Republicans have a 51-49 vote margin [in the Senate] and will need numerous Democrats to break ranks to pass a spending bill,” Height said.  After so many government shutdown threats in the past, investors seem to be mostly ignoring the noise out of Washington. Despite the looming deadline, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) is up 1.3 percent over the past five trading sessions.

REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan                                           By Yuval Rosenberg   Follow      March 19, 2018                                   MOST POPULAR                           The scramble is on. Any minute now, lawmakers are set to unveil the $1.2 trillion omnibus bill to fund the government ahead of a March 23 deadline to avoid a third federal shutdown this year.  Under the two-year budget deal that Congress passed last month, defense spending would rise by $80 billion and non-defense spending by $63 billion for the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. But while a number of questions about just what will be included in the funding bill still need to be answered, appropriators and observers sound confident that they’ll be able to steer a path toward passage. “The pie has been baked, they are just quibbling over the scraps,” Chris Kruger of the Cowen Washington Research Group told clients Monday morning.  Still, the timing is tight — the House is expected to vote on the bill Wednesday, leaving the Senate just a couple of days to also pass it. A possible snowstorm slated to hit D.C. Tuesday or Wednesday won’t help. And there are still plenty of scraps for lawmakers to fight over. The omnibus bill is likely the last major piece of must-pass legislation before the midterm elections, so members of Congress “have been scrambling to attach a variety of pet issues to the bill, holding up its release,” The Hill reported .  Given the likely time crunch and the many details still to be decided, Krueger warned that the week could still end with another hours-long shutdown of the sort Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) forced last month. Budget expert Stan Collender put the chances of a shutdown at 25 percent to start the week, but wrote that “President Donald Trump's positions and demands are so erratic that the possibility of a White House-induced shutdown cannot and must not be dismissed out of hand.”  One factor that may smooth the way for action this week: Lawmakers are slated to depart for a two-week holiday recess once the funding bill is done. “Whenever Congress finds itself on the edge of a vacation, it typically follows the path of least resistance,” Krueger said. “In this case, we think that means spending more than a trillion dollars before leaving Dodge.”                                             Yuval Rosenberg         As editor in chief, Yuval Rosenberg oversees all aspects of The Fiscal Times' website and email newsletter.

By  Tara Golshan   Updated Mar 22, 2018,  1:00pm EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Congress is coming down to the wire on keeping the government open      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images     Congress is on its way to pass a $1.3 trillion funding package , a last-minute deal that left most legislators with less than 36 hours to review and vote on the 2,232-page bill to avert a shutdown on Friday. The House passed the bill Thursday afternoon, and it is now on to the Senate.  The final spending deal beefs up military and domestic spending and includes $1.6 billion for the southern border wall, with some restrictions, and patches up some flaws in the GOP tax bill. It also devotes $3.2 billion more to combat the opioid epidemic, and includes the Fix NICS Act , reinforcing existing gun background check laws.  This Congress is coming off two government shutdowns in the last three months. The first shutdown came in January  and lasted for three days, during a standoff over the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Then in February, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) effectively shut down the government himself, this time only for a few hours overnight, in a stand against a deal negotiated by congressional leaders that would bust the government budget caps on domestic and military spending that have been in place since 2013.  Big legislative fights over gun control and DACA were largely off the table this time. And having kicked down any permanent solution to government spending since September 2017, and currently on their fifth short-term spending bill, Congress’s more permanent funding package would carry them through to the start of the new fiscal year on September 30.  But after weeks of head-butting between parties, which slowed down negotiations, compromises over controversial issues like hiking spending for the Department of Homeland Security to expand the number of immigrant detainee beds, the border wall and infrastructure spending, have angered the flanks of both parties. Already House conservatives voted against the bill, railing against the high spending numbers and lack of right-wing policy priorities — meaning the final package had to attract more Democratic votes. Another conservative revolt in the Senate likely wouldn’t have enough support to block the bill altogether, but could delay passing the spending package by the midnight deadline Friday.  Republicans look like they have enough Senate Democrats to sign on to their spending agenda for it to pass the filibuster rule. And for now, it seems the White House is on board with the spending bill, despite reports Wednesday afternoon indicating Trump wasn’t too pleased with the outcome. With the midterm elections around the corner, there’s little appetite in Congress for another government shutdown, and lawmakers seem more willing to let their controversial policy priorities fall to the side, which makes this final push a race against the clock.  This spending bill took a lot of compromise  In February, lawmakers set themselves up to reach a more permanent spending agreement by the end of March. Congress agreed to increases to domestic and defense spending over the next two years, raising funding for domestic programs by $128 billion and hiking defense budgets by $160 billion. But they didn’t actually decide where the money would go.  Since passing the budget deal, appropriators — the lawmakers in charge of the nation’s purse strings — have been negotiating how to allocate the money. In the last couple of days lawmakers were still butting heads over 20 to 25 provisions, one Democratic aide close to negotiations said.  Now they have come to an agreement. This bill would fund the government through the end of September — the end of the 2018 fiscal year — and come in the form of an omnibus, which jams together 12 individual appropriations bills into one funding package.  On immigration, lawmakers went into the week at odds over a Republican call to hike funding for DHS to boost interior enforcement of illegal immigration, which Democrats say will only increase efforts to deport nonviolent undocumented immigrants, who are typically deprioritized. They have reached compromise, funding and additional 328 additional Customs and Border Protection officers, but requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to reduce the number detention beds.  Funding for the border wall was also included — $1.6 billion will be allocated for Trump’s pet project, far less than the White House last minute as for all $25 billion, and with some strings attached.  The spending bill also increases funding for the National Institute of Health by $3 billion and puts $3.2 billion toward the opioid epidemic.  Several major issues were notably dropped from the final package, namely a push to stabilize the Obamacare markets. After Republicans voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which taxed individuals for not having health insurance, premiums are expected to rise by 10 percent, according to projections from the Congressional Budget Office. Conservatives derided the whole effort as “bailing out” a failed health care policy and Republican leaders pushed to attach language that would prevent the Obamacare payments from going toward any insurance plan that covers abortions — which Democrats say would adversely impact low income women. With neither party willing to concede, the Obamacare  stabilization funding was dropped all together.  The $900 million proposal for the Gateway infrastructure project, to construct a commuter rail tunnel between New Jersey and New York under the Hudson, was also left out the deal. Instead, the spending bill will include $446 million through Amtrak and federal grants that do not require the Department of Transportation’s stamp of approval, that can go toward Gateway.  Now leaders have to convince their ranks to support the bill before the government shutdown deadline Friday.  Now it’s a race against the clock  It’s clear House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell eager to get this done, so Congress can go on recess.  But with a deadline on March 23, they don’t have much time, and a lot of procedural hoops to go through.  On Thursday the House passed a rule saying the spending legislation could bypass a typical three-day sitting period between a bill’s release and the vote, and the omnibus sailed through the final vote, passing with bipartisan support less than 18 hours after the bill was released.  But in the Senate, like with the last shutdown, any senator can take over the floor and push the debate passed the shutdown deadline.  There are already signs that Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who orchestrated the last shutdown almost single-handedly because of his frustration with the high spending levels, isn’t happy with this bill. He told reporters he’s still “undecided” on how he will act on the bill, but tweeted frustrations with the final compromise. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), who called the omnibus a “great-dane-sized whiz down the leg,” also expressed frustration with the bill.  And, as with all spending bills, the final say comes down to Trump, who was originally unhappy with the final product. After House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Trump earlier Wednesday, the White House released a statement saying the president supported the spending package, despite reports that Trump was weighing a veto.  Democrats dropped their DACA demands  Behind both government shutdowns this year was a policy fight not directly tied to government spending: immigration.  In January, Senate Democrats, frustrated with Trump’s unwillingness to accept a bipartisan proposal to address the nearly 700,000 immigrants in legal limbo under DACA, orchestrated a shutdown with the support of some Republicans. The result was a failed and inconclusive Senate floor debate on the issue.  Again in February, a conservative revolt over the budget deal meant that House Republicans, who have a big enough majority to pass legislation without Democratic support, suddenly needed votes from across the aisle. Rand Paul shut down the government over frustration with the budget, and House Democrats had to decide whether they would sign on to reopening it without any gains on immigration. Ultimately, House and Senate Democrats voted for the final bill.  Democrats changed their tune on DACA and seem less interested in tying big policy priorities, including issues like gun control, to the spending fight. A DACA fix “doesn’t have to be on the omnibus bill,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said last week.  Meanwhile, Trump had some immigration priorities of his own, including fully funding for the border wall and his call for Congress to defund “sanctuary cities,” is only getting a small par of his ask.  It’s clear members of Congress, including Republicans, don’t have much of an appetite for larger policy fights outside of the spending bill.

Congress has until the end of Friday to approve a plan to keep the government open.       Eamon Javers | Jacob Pramuk   Published 10:04  AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018  Updated  12:03  PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018  CNBC.com                show chapters               This is what happens when the U.S. government shuts down   8:46  AM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 |  02:07       Chances of a government shutdown are rising, a top White House official told CNBC on Friday.   Mick Mulvaney, chief of the Office of Management and Budget, said that odds of a shutdown occurring are 50-50.  "We were operating under sort of a 30 percent shutdown up until yesterday," he told CNBC. "I think we're ratcheting it up now."   Other White House aides told CNBC that "it doesn't look good."  Congress has until the end of Friday to approve a spending measure to keep the government open. The House on Thursday passed a measure that would continue funding the government for another month, but opposition from Senate Democrats and some Republicans make it unlikely that such a measure can pass.  Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said that President Donald Trump has been making phone calls in a bid to avert a shutdown, and that he hopes the government doesn't close.  "The president stands ready to sign a bill" that will fund the government, Short told reporters during a briefing Friday.  If a shutdown happens, it will come just as Trump is marking his first full year in office. The president is planning to stick around Washington until the Senate passes a stopgap spending measure. Trump was slated to travel to his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he plans to attend a big-money fundraiser celebrating the first anniversary of his inauguration . The White House later said he would not go to Florida on Friday as originally planned.  In the breifing, both Mulvaney and Short tried to preemptively put the blame for a possible shutdown on Democrats. Asked about whether Trump rejecting a bipartisan immigration deal and reportedly calling certain nations "s---hole" countries set back funding talks, Mulvaney argued that "there's no way" Trump should take the blame for a shutdown.  He said Trump is "actively working" to strike a funding deal and contended that President Barack Obama did not do the same before a 2013 shutdown.  Nearly all Democrats have held out from supporting the GOP plan because they also want to pass a bill that would protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to extend government funding for a few days in hopes of reaching an immigration agreement and longer-term spending deal.  Trump and McConnell face some resistance within their own party in the Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an interview with MSNBC that he would not vote for a 30-day continuing resolution. He also said he was against a four-day deal.  Mulvaney cast doubts on lawmakers finding an immigration solution soon, saying the bipartisan lawmakers who presented a deal to Trump did not have legislative text for it.  The proposal also sought to meet Republican demands for increased border security funding and changes to extended family migration and the visa "lottery" system.

Politics   Jan 16, 2018 6:31 PM EDT    Let’s ignore the deja vu factor and skip right to the key question: Will the U.S. government shut down this week? The honest answer is, of course, as in the many other government shutdown scenarios of the past few years, no one can say with certainty.  But we can help gauge the odds. Here are some things that could make a shutdown more (or less) likely.  A shutdown is more likely if:   President Donald Trump’s rhetoric, including his tweets, becomes sharper.  Democrats’ rhetoric becomes sharper (and statements start flowing faster).  House Republicans exit their meeting Tuesday night openly unhappy. As it stands now, Speaker Paul Ryan needs 218 out of the 239 House Republicans to vote yes on a deal to fund the government. (Democrats insist they won’t support it without a deal on the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that protects young “Dreamers” from deportation.) But many conservatives have railed against the idea of another short-term deal. A temperature check of those Republicans will tell us a lot.  The conservative House Freedom Caucus decides to vote against a short-term spending deal. That alone could derail it.  Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell announces there is no deal or possible deal on DACA this week. That could create problems with moderate Senate Democrats needed to pass government funding.  Sen.Cory Gardner, R-Colo., breaks from the bipartisan group of six working on a DACA deal. Its prospects would dim, as would prospects for a spending deal.   A shutdown is less likely if:   The president’s rhetoric becomes less sharp. This especially includes if he says the word “bipartisan” or has warm words for Democrats.  Key Democrats and Republicans stop commenting about negotiations. This is usually a sign of progress, or a chance for progress.  McConnell announces he will allow a “test” vote on a bipartisan DACA bill.  Republicans request some other wish list item, such as postponing the medical device tax, and Democrats signal they are open to it.

By Perry Bacon Jr.  Filed under Government Shutdown    Facebook Twitter Email                  The odds of a government shutdown have gone up.  This is a fast-developing story, so stay tuned, but a bloc of Senate Democrats has shifted towards a more aggressive stance on including an immigration provision in the government funding bill, increasing the possibility that the party will block any measure that does not create some kind of program along the lines of former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals . There will be a government shutdown starting at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday if funding is not approved.  There is still some doubt over whether the House will pass a short-term funding bill. (GOP leaders are currently proposing an agreement that extends funding for one more month .) The House can pass a bill without any Democratic support, but members of the hard-to-please GOP Freedom Caucus there are balking right now . So that’s one hurdle towards avoiding a shutdown.  Another hurdle is what’s taking place in the Senate, where legislation can be stopped if it doesn’t have 60 votes. There are only 51 Republicans, and some of them are saying they don’t support a funding bill without the immigration provision either. Some Republicans are also frustrated that Congress keeps passing short-term measures. But the bigger challenge is Democrats. Even if all the Republicans vote for some kind of short-term extension, at least nine Democrats must back it.  Party activists have been imploring Democrats for months to stop supporting government funding bills that don’t replace DACA, which provided protection from deportation and work permits for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children until Trump announced he was ending it. I didn’t think , as recently as 24 hours ago, Democrats as a party were ready to take that stand.  But in the last two days, several Senate Democrats who voted for government funding bills in December even though they didn’t address DACA have said they would not do so again. That group includes Virginia’s Tim Kaine and Mark Warner , New Mexico’s Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall and New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen . And twenty-eight of the Democrats currently serving in the Senate, along with Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, have already voted against a previous funding bill that didn’t address DACA.  Some of those members could change their minds, of course, with a shutdown seeming more possible than before. But it appears that the vast majority of the 49 Senate Democrats are voting “no” on any bill that does not address DACA. So it’s worth at this point flipping the question: Who might be the nine Democrats to vote for a short-term measure with no immigration language?  Let’s start with the seven members in states Trump won who are up for reelection this year and voted in December for a funding bill without a DACA provision: Indiana’s Joe Donnelly, North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, Missouri’s Claire McCaskill, Florida’s Bill Nelson, Michigan’s Debbie Stabenow and Montana’s Jon Tester.  Then there’s Doug Jones, who as of this month represents the very red state of Alabama. He’s not up for re-election until 2020, but he has cast himself as a bipartisan senator . And Michigan’s Gary Peters, who’s up for reelection in 2020, is also from a state Trump won and has previously backed a funding bill that didn’t address DACA.  It’s these members to watch: If several of them announce they won’t vote for a funding bill without DACA either, it will be hard to avoid a shutdown.

Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images A government shutdown is looking more likely as hardliners in both parties dig in, meaning Congress may not have the votes to pass a spending bill by the end of the week. But again, it's only Wednesday, and there's going to be strong pressure to not let federal funding lapse. What we're watching: Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are saying they won't back the bill, meaning Republican leaders will need help from Democrats who say they won't offer it. The Democratic base is pressuring its members to hold the line on immigration — and get a solution to DACA included in any spending bill. Show less Keep reading 56 Words What they're saying: Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows: "I have not talked with the President...If the President outline[d] a plan on how this [spending bill] will be different than the last three then of course it would matter." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Wednesday there's broad opposition to the spending bill among Democrats Politics https://www.axios.com/trump-reaction-cohen-mueller-raid-4de566f7-2b18-4419-a689-69ec81666ffc.html Mike Allen  6 hours ago Save Featured Inside the West Wing with Trump enraged Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Sources close to the president say that a political dispute with special counsel Robert Mueller has turned visceral and personal after the feds' raid on the New York offices of Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer and fixer. What we're hearing: One of the sources said: "Mueller's investigation has been drip, drip. This was a giant leap forward ... a personal hit. ... They were moving in inches. Today, they moved a mile." Show less Keep reading 566 Words Until now, when storms hit, Trump could turn to Hope Hicks to explain things to him, suggest wording, simmer him down. With her departure from the White House, we saw the president working out his fury in real time. The source continued: "This is the first crisis post-Hope Hicks. ... This was different: I've never seen him like this before. ... This is the president you're going to see more of from here on out: unvarnished, untethered." Another source close to Trump said: "He takes the Russia stuff as a political hit job. This was a personal affront. This was the red line" of intrusion into personal financial matters. The president — arms crossed defiantly — held a stunning on-camera venting session during an appearance with his senior military leadership where a potential strike on Syria took second billing to Michael Cohen ("With all of that being said, we are here to discuss Syria tonight"). The WashPost cites three sources as saying Cohen "is under federal investigation for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations." A statement from Cohen's lawyer, Stephen Ryan, said: "The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients." During the 10-minute rant , Trump ... ... used "disgrace" seven times and "disgraceful" twice. ... fumed about an action by agents of the government he heads: "I just heard that they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys — a good man. ... It's a total witch hunt." ...accused those agents of his government of "an attack on our country, in a true sense. It's an attack on what we all stand for." ... said, repeating back a question: "Why don't I just fire Mueller? ... Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on. We'll see what happens. But I think it's really a sad situation when you look at what happened. And many people have said, 'You should fire him." ... referred to the investigation as "the most conflicted group of people I've ever seen. The Attorney General made a terrible mistake ... when he recused himself.  ... [W]e would have ... put a different Attorney General in." ... quadrupled down on firing FBI Director James Comey: "One of the things they said: 'I fired Comey.'  Well, I turned out to do the right thing, because if you look at all of the things that he's done and the lies, and you look at what's gone on at the FBI with the insurance policy and all of the things that happened — turned out I did the right thing." Be smart: Close aides are recommending against firing Mueller. But that means little these days. The big, surreal picture : Take a minute to think about the history unfolding before our eyes. You have the president’s top lawyer getting raided by the FBI, prompting the president to warn of an epic attack on government and signaling he might try to can the special counsel investigating him. This is on the eve of the arguably most powerful and well known CEO of our generation getting grilled by Congress, in part because the Russians used his platform to try to elect the man at the center of it all. History books will be written about this — and you were there to see it all unfold. Politics https://www.axios.com/privacy-services-gaining-from-facebook-ac3b16c8-425c-42d1-9e80-5309c22a9c91.html Scott Rosenberg  6 hours ago Save Featured Facebook scandals boost privacy-focused social, search sites Illustration: Lazaro Gamio/Axios Facebook's privacy scandals may be creating a stronger market for privacy-oriented sites and services, which are seeing a slow increase in use in the wake of the latest revelations. The big picture: So far, it's a stream, not a flood. But it's a useful proxy for measuring possible defections from Facebook, since no one outside Facebook knows for sure whether significant numbers of people are abandoning the network. Show less The services 416 Words Even though #deletefacebook is a trendy hashtag, Facebook says it's seen no "meaningful" drop in usage, and it's not likely to disclose updated numbers until its next quarterly report in about a month. The catch: There's no popular, privacy-conscious alternative to Facebook waiting to welcome defectors, the way Lyft was standing by to snap up disenchanted Uber customers during the heyday of #deleteuber. Instead, we have to look at other tools and services that Facebook-deleters might also adopt as they try to assert control over their personal data. What they're saying: Brave , a privacy-first, open-source web browser, saw an uptick in user adoption in the weeks since Facebook's Cambridge Analytica revelations. Brave recently hit the 2 million monthly average user mark. DuckDuckGo , the search engine that promises users control over their data, is seeing its highest traffic ever, with more than 24 million direct search queries per day. Mastodon , a federated open-source alternative to Twitter, reported about 37,000 new users in the last two weeks of March, compared to a previous rate of about 6,000 a week. Privacy Badger , the Electronic Frontier Foundation's browser add-on that monitors ad tracking, says it has seen a roughly 50% increase in installations of its Chrome extension, and now has roughly 2 million users. Between the lines: Such numbers are healthy but hardly staggering, and they barely register on the scale of Facebook's billions. The outlook is similarly modest for other new privacy-enhancing products and services, like Mozilla's Facebook Container (which sequesters all Facebook-related activity from everything else you do in Mozilla's Firefox browser) or CloudFlare's new 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver (which promises not to sell or share the internet-routing queries all your online moves generate). The odds: Privacy-oriented businesses know they face a tough climb luring Facebook's customers. Past Facebook-flight fads have either faded into obscurity ( Diaspora ) or drifted into narrow niches ( Ello ). That's unlikely to change without new regulations, like a requirement that Facebook make your friend-network data portable — so you could move it to a Facebook competitor the way you move your phone number from one cell provider to another. "We're considering this not a moment, but a new era, a new world," says Brendan Eich, Brave's CEO. Gina Bianchini, CEO of Mighty Networks, which helps entrepreneurs build individualized social networks, says there won't be a "next" Facebook but rather a multitude of more specialized successors. "This is not going to happen overnight or in a few weeks," Bianchini says. "More like two to five years."

In a new note to clients on Wednesday, Height Securities said there’s a 45-percent chance the government will shut down as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill by the deadline midnight Friday. The more likely scenario, the firm said, is that Congress will once again simply choose to kick the can down the road by extending its spending bill deadline by another month. Either way, Congress is not likely to pass a much-needed spending bill by the end of the week, Height said.  “The latest government funding bill offered by Congressional Republicans does not provide a straightforward path toward resolution by midnight this Friday, but we still think it is more likely than not enough Democrats will join Republicans to simply kick the can for four weeks (until Feb. 16) on the government funding and immigration debates,” according to Height.  Democrats and Republicans remain deeply divided on the DACA immigration debate, and Democrats are insisting the next government funding bill include money for DACA in order to snag any Democratic votes. Several fiscally conservative Republicans plan to vote against the current Republican spending bill, likely leaving its fate in the hands of Democrats.  “Republicans have a 51-49 vote margin [in the Senate] and will need numerous Democrats to break ranks to pass a spending bill,” Height said.  After so many government shutdown threats in the past, investors seem to be mostly ignoring the noise out of Washington. Despite the looming deadline, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) is up 1.3 percent over the past five trading sessions.

REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan                                           By Yuval Rosenberg   Follow      March 19, 2018                                   MOST POPULAR                           The scramble is on. Any minute now, lawmakers are set to unveil the $1.2 trillion omnibus bill to fund the government ahead of a March 23 deadline to avoid a third federal shutdown this year.  Under the two-year budget deal that Congress passed last month, defense spending would rise by $80 billion and non-defense spending by $63 billion for the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. But while a number of questions about just what will be included in the funding bill still need to be answered, appropriators and observers sound confident that they’ll be able to steer a path toward passage. “The pie has been baked, they are just quibbling over the scraps,” Chris Kruger of the Cowen Washington Research Group told clients Monday morning.  Still, the timing is tight — the House is expected to vote on the bill Wednesday, leaving the Senate just a couple of days to also pass it. A possible snowstorm slated to hit D.C. Tuesday or Wednesday won’t help. And there are still plenty of scraps for lawmakers to fight over. The omnibus bill is likely the last major piece of must-pass legislation before the midterm elections, so members of Congress “have been scrambling to attach a variety of pet issues to the bill, holding up its release,” The Hill reported .  Given the likely time crunch and the many details still to be decided, Krueger warned that the week could still end with another hours-long shutdown of the sort Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) forced last month. Budget expert Stan Collender put the chances of a shutdown at 25 percent to start the week, but wrote that “President Donald Trump's positions and demands are so erratic that the possibility of a White House-induced shutdown cannot and must not be dismissed out of hand.”  One factor that may smooth the way for action this week: Lawmakers are slated to depart for a two-week holiday recess once the funding bill is done. “Whenever Congress finds itself on the edge of a vacation, it typically follows the path of least resistance,” Krueger said. “In this case, we think that means spending more than a trillion dollars before leaving Dodge.”                                             Yuval Rosenberg         As editor in chief, Yuval Rosenberg oversees all aspects of The Fiscal Times' website and email newsletter.

By  Tara Golshan   Updated Mar 22, 2018,  1:00pm EDT        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Congress is coming down to the wire on keeping the government open      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images     Congress is on its way to pass a $1.3 trillion funding package , a last-minute deal that left most legislators with less than 36 hours to review and vote on the 2,232-page bill to avert a shutdown on Friday. The House passed the bill Thursday afternoon, and it is now on to the Senate.  The final spending deal beefs up military and domestic spending and includes $1.6 billion for the southern border wall, with some restrictions, and patches up some flaws in the GOP tax bill. It also devotes $3.2 billion more to combat the opioid epidemic, and includes the Fix NICS Act , reinforcing existing gun background check laws.  This Congress is coming off two government shutdowns in the last three months. The first shutdown came in January  and lasted for three days, during a standoff over the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Then in February, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) effectively shut down the government himself, this time only for a few hours overnight, in a stand against a deal negotiated by congressional leaders that would bust the government budget caps on domestic and military spending that have been in place since 2013.  Big legislative fights over gun control and DACA were largely off the table this time. And having kicked down any permanent solution to government spending since September 2017, and currently on their fifth short-term spending bill, Congress’s more permanent funding package would carry them through to the start of the new fiscal year on September 30.  But after weeks of head-butting between parties, which slowed down negotiations, compromises over controversial issues like hiking spending for the Department of Homeland Security to expand the number of immigrant detainee beds, the border wall and infrastructure spending, have angered the flanks of both parties. Already House conservatives voted against the bill, railing against the high spending numbers and lack of right-wing policy priorities — meaning the final package had to attract more Democratic votes. Another conservative revolt in the Senate likely wouldn’t have enough support to block the bill altogether, but could delay passing the spending package by the midnight deadline Friday.  Republicans look like they have enough Senate Democrats to sign on to their spending agenda for it to pass the filibuster rule. And for now, it seems the White House is on board with the spending bill, despite reports Wednesday afternoon indicating Trump wasn’t too pleased with the outcome. With the midterm elections around the corner, there’s little appetite in Congress for another government shutdown, and lawmakers seem more willing to let their controversial policy priorities fall to the side, which makes this final push a race against the clock.  This spending bill took a lot of compromise  In February, lawmakers set themselves up to reach a more permanent spending agreement by the end of March. Congress agreed to increases to domestic and defense spending over the next two years, raising funding for domestic programs by $128 billion and hiking defense budgets by $160 billion. But they didn’t actually decide where the money would go.  Since passing the budget deal, appropriators — the lawmakers in charge of the nation’s purse strings — have been negotiating how to allocate the money. In the last couple of days lawmakers were still butting heads over 20 to 25 provisions, one Democratic aide close to negotiations said.  Now they have come to an agreement. This bill would fund the government through the end of September — the end of the 2018 fiscal year — and come in the form of an omnibus, which jams together 12 individual appropriations bills into one funding package.  On immigration, lawmakers went into the week at odds over a Republican call to hike funding for DHS to boost interior enforcement of illegal immigration, which Democrats say will only increase efforts to deport nonviolent undocumented immigrants, who are typically deprioritized. They have reached compromise, funding and additional 328 additional Customs and Border Protection officers, but requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to reduce the number detention beds.  Funding for the border wall was also included — $1.6 billion will be allocated for Trump’s pet project, far less than the White House last minute as for all $25 billion, and with some strings attached.  The spending bill also increases funding for the National Institute of Health by $3 billion and puts $3.2 billion toward the opioid epidemic.  Several major issues were notably dropped from the final package, namely a push to stabilize the Obamacare markets. After Republicans voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which taxed individuals for not having health insurance, premiums are expected to rise by 10 percent, according to projections from the Congressional Budget Office. Conservatives derided the whole effort as “bailing out” a failed health care policy and Republican leaders pushed to attach language that would prevent the Obamacare payments from going toward any insurance plan that covers abortions — which Democrats say would adversely impact low income women. With neither party willing to concede, the Obamacare  stabilization funding was dropped all together.  The $900 million proposal for the Gateway infrastructure project, to construct a commuter rail tunnel between New Jersey and New York under the Hudson, was also left out the deal. Instead, the spending bill will include $446 million through Amtrak and federal grants that do not require the Department of Transportation’s stamp of approval, that can go toward Gateway.  Now leaders have to convince their ranks to support the bill before the government shutdown deadline Friday.  Now it’s a race against the clock  It’s clear House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell eager to get this done, so Congress can go on recess.  But with a deadline on March 23, they don’t have much time, and a lot of procedural hoops to go through.  On Thursday the House passed a rule saying the spending legislation could bypass a typical three-day sitting period between a bill’s release and the vote, and the omnibus sailed through the final vote, passing with bipartisan support less than 18 hours after the bill was released.  But in the Senate, like with the last shutdown, any senator can take over the floor and push the debate passed the shutdown deadline.  There are already signs that Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who orchestrated the last shutdown almost single-handedly because of his frustration with the high spending levels, isn’t happy with this bill. He told reporters he’s still “undecided” on how he will act on the bill, but tweeted frustrations with the final compromise. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), who called the omnibus a “great-dane-sized whiz down the leg,” also expressed frustration with the bill.  And, as with all spending bills, the final say comes down to Trump, who was originally unhappy with the final product. After House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Trump earlier Wednesday, the White House released a statement saying the president supported the spending package, despite reports that Trump was weighing a veto.  Democrats dropped their DACA demands  Behind both government shutdowns this year was a policy fight not directly tied to government spending: immigration.  In January, Senate Democrats, frustrated with Trump’s unwillingness to accept a bipartisan proposal to address the nearly 700,000 immigrants in legal limbo under DACA, orchestrated a shutdown with the support of some Republicans. The result was a failed and inconclusive Senate floor debate on the issue.  Again in February, a conservative revolt over the budget deal meant that House Republicans, who have a big enough majority to pass legislation without Democratic support, suddenly needed votes from across the aisle. Rand Paul shut down the government over frustration with the budget, and House Democrats had to decide whether they would sign on to reopening it without any gains on immigration. Ultimately, House and Senate Democrats voted for the final bill.  Democrats changed their tune on DACA and seem less interested in tying big policy priorities, including issues like gun control, to the spending fight. A DACA fix “doesn’t have to be on the omnibus bill,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said last week.  Meanwhile, Trump had some immigration priorities of his own, including fully funding for the border wall and his call for Congress to defund “sanctuary cities,” is only getting a small par of his ask.  It’s clear members of Congress, including Republicans, don’t have much of an appetite for larger policy fights outside of the spending bill.

Eamon Javers | Jacob Pramuk   Published 10:04  AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018  Updated  12:03  PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018  CNBC.com                show chapters               This is what happens when the U.S. government shuts down   8:46  AM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 |  02:07       Chances of a government shutdown are rising, a top White House official told CNBC on Friday.   Mick Mulvaney, chief of the Office of Management and Budget, said that odds of a shutdown occurring are 50-50.  "We were operating under sort of a 30 percent shutdown up until yesterday," he told CNBC. "I think we're ratcheting it up now."   Other White House aides told CNBC that "it doesn't look good."  Congress has until the end of Friday to approve a spending measure to keep the government open. The House on Thursday passed a measure that would continue funding the government for another month, but opposition from Senate Democrats and some Republicans make it unlikely that such a measure can pass.  Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said that President Donald Trump has been making phone calls in a bid to avert a shutdown, and that he hopes the government doesn't close.  "The president stands ready to sign a bill" that will fund the government, Short told reporters during a briefing Friday.  If a shutdown happens, it will come just as Trump is marking his first full year in office. The president is planning to stick around Washington until the Senate passes a stopgap spending measure. Trump was slated to travel to his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he plans to attend a big-money fundraiser celebrating the first anniversary of his inauguration . The White House later said he would not go to Florida on Friday as originally planned.  In the breifing, both Mulvaney and Short tried to preemptively put the blame for a possible shutdown on Democrats. Asked about whether Trump rejecting a bipartisan immigration deal and reportedly calling certain nations "s---hole" countries set back funding talks, Mulvaney argued that "there's no way" Trump should take the blame for a shutdown.  He said Trump is "actively working" to strike a funding deal and contended that President Barack Obama did not do the same before a 2013 shutdown.  Nearly all Democrats have held out from supporting the GOP plan because they also want to pass a bill that would protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to extend government funding for a few days in hopes of reaching an immigration agreement and longer-term spending deal.  Trump and McConnell face some resistance within their own party in the Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an interview with MSNBC that he would not vote for a 30-day continuing resolution. He also said he was against a four-day deal.  Mulvaney cast doubts on lawmakers finding an immigration solution soon, saying the bipartisan lawmakers who presented a deal to Trump did not have legislative text for it.  The proposal also sought to meet Republican demands for increased border security funding and changes to extended family migration and the visa "lottery" system.
