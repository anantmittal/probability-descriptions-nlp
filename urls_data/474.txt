After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Share          Expert Answer       The BabyCentre editorial team  Our panel of health writers     Non-identical (fraternal) twins tend to run in families. But identical twins don't.  Non-identical twins are the result of two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. There is a gene that makes a woman more likely to release two or more eggs during ovulation, and it's this gene that runs in families. Identical twins are the result of a single fertilised egg splitting, and this seems to be a random event.  So if you're a woman and non-identical twins run in your family, you're more likely to have a set yourself. It's estimated that you're about two and a half times more likely than average to have twins if you're a non-identical twin, or have siblings who are non-identical twins.  A man with a family history of twins may carry the gene, but it won't mean he can father a set of non-identical twins. The gene is only expressed through women who ovulate. If he has daughters, they may inherit the gene, and one day go on to have fraternal twins.  This may explain why some people think that twins skip a generation in families. You may have heard, for example, that if your mum or dad is a twin but you're not, you're more likely to have twins yourself. There's no evidence to support this. What can happen, though, is that a dad can pass on the non-identical twin gene to his daughters and this may make twins appear to skip a generation.  Your heritage can affect your chances of having twins. For example, non-identical twins are most common in women of Central African origin, and least common in women of South-East Asian and Latin American origin.  Aside from inheritance, age plays a big role in how likely you are to have twins. If you're a woman in your mid-30s or beyond, you have a greater chance than a younger woman of having twins or more. As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which could trigger your ovaries to release several eggs each month.  The use of some fertility treatments also increases the likelihood of a woman having twins. All treatments that stimulate the ovaries to release eggs or involve two or more embryos being transferred to the womb increase the chance of multiple births.

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Twins  Reproduction Does being a twin increase the likelihood of having twins? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 7 Answers Quora User , I've been a twin for...wait, how long?! Answered Apr 4, 2017 · Author has 784 answers and 1.5m answer views Thanks for the ask! Identical twins are a genetic “accident” so to speak (a really cool one), and there is no way to increase your chances there. From what I understand, several factors can increase the likelihood of having fraternal twins, including: Fertility treatments. Mom’s age -older women have more chances, and also more chances of other flukes, like genetic disorders :( History of twins on the expecting mother’s side -fraternal twins are not genetic, it’s all about two eggs being released at once. I’ve seen shirts that say “Real men make twins!” LOL if you have fraternal twins, you had nothing to do with it, buddy -not more than with any other baby, anyway. None of these factors were involved for my twin sister and me. We were surprises! Haha. One of us more than the other. It is known that twin births are becoming more common. My guess is it’s due to the increased effectiveness of fertility treatments, and the fact that in many cultures (like here in the U.S.) women are starting their families later, so there are more older women having kids. 2.8k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Nancy Dutton Bankston Related Questions More Answers Below What factors increase the chances of having fraternal twins? How can I increase my chances of having identical twins? What are the chances of having twins? How can I increase the chances of having twins? I have relatives that were twins. Do my chances of having twins increase? Ask New Question   M. T. Owens , Answered Feb 9, 2012 · Author has 343 answers and 1.4m answer views The probability of bearing fraternal twins is thought to be heritable, since it involves how many eggs a woman sheds at a time, which is a trait that is biologically based and might be subject to biological regulation. As you might expect from this hypothesis, some ethnic groups are known to have a higher probability of bearing fraternal twins than others. On the other hand, the probability of bearing identical twins is thought to not be heritable. Identical twins arise from rare, random "twinning" events early in embryological development. Therefore, if you are a woman and a fraternal twin, you *might* have inherited genes from your family that increase your chances of ovulating more than one egg at the same time, which would increase your chances of having twins. However, if you are an identical twin, you probably don't have an increased chance of having twins. 34.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Undo   Joy Ahmed , |Promoted and |Engineer Answered Jan 26, 2017 · Author has 404 answers and 1.4m answer views Time to dig out the family tree and have a think about your diet – these factors both increase your likelihood of having twins or multiples… Your family history Your lifestyle Number of children you have Maternal age Where you’re from Fertility treatment So, you’re TTC – and visualising yourself brandishing a dirty nappy while your partner wrangles with a babygro. That picture in your head includes one baby, not two or three, right? Thought so. Still, there are factors that can increase your likelihood of conceiving twins or multiples. ‘Identical twins, which make up around a third of twin pregnancies, come from one egg and are basically a fluke of nature – there’s no known common factor in those,’ says David Davies, consultant obstetrician at Portsmouth’s Queen Alexandra Hospital. ‘But with non-identical twins or triplets, which come from different eggs, there are several shared influences.’ From what you eat to the size of your family, get clued up on the likelihood that you’re going to need a bigger buggy. Your family history Yes, that’s your history, not his. In fact, even if your partner has twins in his family, it makes no difference. ‘It’s all about the woman because you’re the one producing the eggs, so if you or your mum are twins, or perhaps your sister has multiple babies, then you’ll be more likely to conceive more than one,’ says David. Your lifestyle Women who have a low-fat diet, especially vegans and vegetarians, are less likely to have multiples than someone who goes for the whole milk and tucks into steak every Friday. ‘The possible causes of this are subtle hormonal changes in people with these different diets, as well as perhaps someone with a higher fat diet having a higher body mass index (BMI) – that’s a measure for checking how healthy your weight is in relation to your height,’ says David. Number of children you have Chances are this is just a case of odds – the more children you’ve had, the more likely at some stage you’ll conceive multiples. The more children you’ve had, the more likely at some stage you’ll conceive multiples You’re simply giving yourself more opportunities to strike lucky. ‘There’s also the possibility that if you’ve always become pregnant easily in the past, you’re basically a good ovulator , so to speak’ says David. Maternal age Naturally conceived twins and triplets are more common in women in their 30s and 40s. ‘This is about the way your ovaries work and how their function changes with age, so you may release more than one egg each month,’ says David. Where you’re from Western Europe sees around one in 60 twin pregnancies, while they’re much more rare in South East Asia. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, twins make up one in every 20 or 30 pregnancies. ‘There are no real theories I’m aware of that would account for this, but interestingly if you’re Nigerian and living in another country, you’re less likely to conceive multiples than if you’re based in Nigeria – so perhaps it’s to do with diet or climate,’ says David. Fertility treatment One of the biggies that can boost your likelihood of having more than one child is having fertility treatment, such as IVF. ‘When IVF started to get really affective in the US during the 1970s and 1980s, twin rates pretty much doubled,’ says David. ‘It’s down to your body being given drugs to stimulate it to ovulate and produce eggs.’ 7.7k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by SunJour Healthcare Corporation UMOOZE is an all-natural dietary supplement for men with BPH.

Undo Anonymous Answered Aug 22, 2014 I have had 2 sets of Fraternal Twins, with the same father- so I know the textbook analysis is bunk  My ex-boyfried has fathered a total of 5 fraternal twins with 3 different women. All natural.  All but one set were intentional, by women who wanted to have the joy of having twins.  All 3 of his brothers also have at least 2 fraternal twins(so far!)   Some men are really more likely to have twins. Most women have multiple follicles maturing at the same time. One becomes dominant and the other dies out. But if the sperm are able to fertilize 2 eggs-before the non-dominant follicle dies out, then the woman may have conceived twins- and 9 months later may become a proud mama of twins. Some men have 30X the "typical" sperms.  Birth Control Pills do not work that well for these men. Their sperm lasts  9 days or so, and enter the uterus, even if the pill is supposed to stop them. The top 1% of the men have sperm quality that is 30X the "typical median" man.  The have more sperms, sperms with better morphology -  and more semen volume- even better Ph levels. My ex-boyfriend and his brothers are very healthy- they are of normal BMI- 32/33 inch waistline, no butter, beef or read meat  - no steroid use to bulk up. Probably explains their advantage over the red meat eating American- some of the American guys cannot even have sex in missionary position- So gross- and so likely to lead to infertility. Both my sets of twins were planned, and "I conceived in the first cycle of trying to concieve for both. First one was concieved at age 36 and the next one at age 42. I just felt it would be simpler to have 2 babies at once. I am financially independent- so having twins was a luxury I could afford. But many women who are not that financially strong also seem to want twins. I am surprised. 6.6k Views   Jeremy Miles , Father of MZ twins Answered Feb 10, 2012 · Author has 3.4k answers and 8.6m answer views To add a little to M. T. Owens 's answer, fraternal twins are inherited down the maternal line, so if you are female and your mother was a fraternal twin, you have a higher probability of producing fraternal twins. For identical twins, there have been a couple of cases where identical twins seemed to be passed down the patenal line - these families (in Denmark) were associated with male infertility as well. But it's usually the case that identical twinning is a random event (as far as anyone can tell). 8.5k Views · View Upvoters   Bruce Feldman , Twinless identical twin.

Ask New Question   Margaret Plotkin , Mother of three, including identical twins Answered Dec 18, 2016 · Author has 1.2k answers and 1m answer views If your father-in-law is an identical twin, this does not change your chances of conceiving twins, as identical twinning is simply random. If your father-in-law is a fraternal twin, this may slightly increase your chances, particularly if you are over age thirty, as increasing maternal age is one of the factors known to be associated with increased fraternal twinning. However, unless your husband’s family has a pronounced history of fraternal twins, the increased likelihood is still quite small. If you are truly anxious about producing twins, I suggest you get started making babies as early as possible, and opt for early ultrasound with fetal reduction should twins occur. There is nothing that can “make it impossible for twins to happen.” If having twins is truly unacceptable to you, you will have to be willing to end a twin pregnancy, in the unlikely event that you conceive twins. If that prospect is also unacceptable to you, then adopt a singleton. 698 Views promoted  by Boomerang for Gmail Your personal AI assistant for writing better emails.

You are no more likely than any other woman to produce multiple eggs at once, so your chance of fraternal twins is not increased. There is not yet any documented understanding of how identical twinning could be passed through families, so your husband does not contribute to an increased chance of identical twins. The rate of conceiving twins does increase with maternal age, and fertility interventions can also increase your chances of twins. 964 Views Related Questions More Answers Below What probability is there that I'll have twins if my father is a twin?

Ask New Question   Carl E. Zimmerman , I've got identical twin boys Answered Jul 18, 2016 · Author has 67 answers and 647.4k answer views Edit: Sorry, I didn’t read the question carefully. I agree with the other answer, your husband being a twin doesn’t change a thing. But since I bothered to write a longer answer, here is a summary of your odds of having twins: I have identical twin boys (now 20) so I’ve done a bit of reading on this. The chance of having identical twins is pretty much a constant. My recollection is that the chances are about 4 in 1000 births. The chance of having fraternal twins depends on a number of factors. I expect that all of these factors only apply to the mother since fraternal twins are due to multiple ovulations so anything that increases that will increase the likelihood of fraternal twins. Your chance of fraternal twins varies based on your race. My recollection that the base rate for Asians was 2 in 1000, for Blacks the chances were something like 8 in 1000 with Whites in the 4 or 5 per 1000 range. Your odds are increased if fraternal twins run in your family. I don’t remember a number for this but one site I just looked at quoted a 1 in 17 chance of having fraternal twins if you were a fraternal twin. I wouldn’t be surprised if you also had increased odds if your ancestors have had fraternal twins even if you aren’t a fraternal twin yourself. Next, the older the mother is the more likely she is to have fraternal twins. Lastly, fertility drugs increase the odds of having fraternal twins. With a little bit of googling you can get lots of statistics, but this is the basic overview. 670 Views promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Identical Twins  Twins If I'm a twin and my boyfriend is a twin, what are the chances of us having twins if I'm pregnant? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 1 Answer Quora User , Mum of 15yo fraternal twin boys Answered Apr 15, 2016 · Author has 1.5k answers and 7.3m answer views Your boyfriend being a twin is irrelevant; it can't influence your having twins one way or another. Identical twins occur spontaneously; the propensity for having identical twins isn't inherited; everybody's chances of having identical twins is the same - about 1 in 300 births. It's presently believed to be more of a "mechanical" than a genetic incident, caused by a spontaneous malfunctioning of early cell division, where the embryo splits into two in such a way as to spontaneously clone itself. The fact that it happens with the same incidence across all cultures and races, with no apparent familial pattern, supports the apparent lack of a genetic linkage. If you're a fraternal twin, where two embryos are formed by the fusion of two eggs with two sperm, then your mother was a double ovulator (i.e. had the capacity to release an egg from each ovary in a cycle, instead of just one egg from one ovary, as is more typical), and may have passed this propensity on to you, and you have a higher chance of also being a double ovulator, and thus of having fraternal twins yourself. The typical incidence of fraternal twins across the overall population is somewhere around 1 in 50 births; for you it is probably significantly higher than that. For you, your chances may be as high as somewhere around 1 in 10 births, given that you are known to be directly descended from a double ovulator.

Undo Answer Wiki 14 Answers Quora User , Certified Chilean Midwife. Answered Jan 29, 2016 · Author has 758 answers and 5.6m answer views Originally Answered: How can we have twins? Naturally? Nothing. Multiple pregnancies are a little bit of a phenomenon. Some women are genetically predisposed to multiple pregnancies but that's mostly because of irregularities in their cycle. Let me explain. During every menstrual cycle, many immature eggs will start to mature in the ovary. Eventually, one will be chosen to complete its development, preventing more from following the same path, and the end result will be the bursting of one follicle that will release one mature egg during ovulation. So, how it happens? There are 2 types of twins. Dizigotic and monozigotic. Dizigotic twins (Fraternal twins): Sometimes, a woman will mature 2 eggs instead of one. Why this happen, is basically because of higher levels of a hormone called gonadotropin. Some women are prone to higher levels of this hormone. So the release of 2 eggs instead of one occurs naturally in very sporadic cycles during her fertile years. Unless your partner is willing to undergo ovulation induction treatment to overstimulate her ovaries to mature several follicles instead of just one, or try in-vitro fertilization, there's no way to increase your chances of multiple pregnancy. Monozigotic twins (Identical twins): Monozigotic twins are a mystery. No one knows why it happens, but we do know how it happens. After fecundation, fast mitosis will occur inside the egg and progenitor cells will multiply. For some unknown reason, this single fecundated egg can collapse, splitting in 2 and forming 2 equal "primitive embryos" that will continue the process individually during its trip to the uterus (Before implantation) It can happen in day 0 - 3 after fecundation (20 - 30% of all monozigotic twins), it can happen after 4 - 8 days (70&) or it can happen 8 - 12 days after (1 - 5% of all monozigotic twins. At this point, that fecundated egg has become a trilaminar embryo, and if the separation is incomplete or happens on day 13, the twins will be conjoined) Because there's no real information about how this process happens, there's no way to know how to induce it. There's a technique used in IVF called embryo splitting that basically uses this concept to increase the number of embryos that are transferred to the womb. If you really, really desire to have twins, and your partner is fertile, then I would recommend ovulation induction treatment (Less invasive, but still risky).

How do I conceive for having twins? How can I increase my chances of having identical twins? Is it possible to reduce the chances of having twins? How? Ask New Question Quora User , I have had twins, and survived. Answered Jan 11, 2018 · Author has 5.8k answers and 8.9m answer views Originally Answered: How can I increase the chances of having baby twins? Well, you can try to go back in time and arrange to be born to a mother with a history of non-identical twins in the family. Non-identical twins tend to run in families, because they depend on the mother having a tendency to produce more than one egg at a time, but identical ones are pretty random, happening when a fertilised egg divides spontaneously and forms two embryos. There is absolutely nothing the father can do to influence either of these events, and the mother only if she has genes that make the two-egg situation slightly more likely. The only other answer is IVF. Failing that, you can cross your fingers and hope, if you really must. But trust me, you only think you want twins. You certainly haven’t thought beyond the “oh, they would be so cute!” or the “well, it would be convenient, two babies for the price of one pregnancy and one lot of labour!” stage. And believe me, there is a great deal more to it than that. Oh, and worse than that, I’ve just discovered that you’re a man, so you haven’t even considered the pregnancy and labour bit - you just think it’s a cute idea, for someone else to have twins for you!! Right, so you choose a prospective wife with a history of non-identical twins in the family, and tell her what a cute idea this would be. Let’s assume she still agrees to marry you, and she does, in due course, become pregnant with twins (or worse, of course. It could be triplets. Have you thought about that?). Actually, your Profile picture suggests there is already a lady in your life, so I hope she is up for this mad scheme of yours, because if it comes to fruition, most of the load is going to fall on her, at least initially. Firstly, your wife, or future wife, can look forward to a fairly uncomfortable pregnancy. Carrying around the weight of a growing baby is not much fun for most of us; you get heartburn, backache, glamorous things like varicose veins and haemorrhoids, and in later months you can’t even get enough sleep, because the pressure of the baby on your bladder means you have to keep getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. And now someone wants you to carry two babies around! Still, all that getting up in the night does help to prepare you for life after the birth. Or births. Let’s assume the births are perfectly straightforward (please try to time things so that your poor wife doesn’t have to carry these babies around in the middle of a heatwave; births in early spring would be much nicer than in the middle of the summer). Anyway, they’re here, everything has gone smoothly and they are both a reasonably good weight, and you’ve got them all home from the hospital. Now what? Well, you know (I hope) that new-born babies tend to need to be fed every 4 hours, right around the clock? So that’s likely to be about 8 feeds in a day, minimum (sometimes the gap is nearer 3 hours than 4, but let’s pretend). Only you’ve got two of them, so that’s 16 feeds every 24 hours, or possibly more. And they might wake up and want feeding at the same time (in which case you’ve got one yelling to be fed while the other is feeding; I hope you are going to do the cuddling, soothing and comforting while this goes on), or else (like mine) they will work watch and watch about, in which case it’s every 2 hours, not every 4. In between feeds of course, there will be changing of clothes, nappies and so on. Some days your poor wife will feel she has spent the past 24 hours doing absolutely nothing except feeding and changing. You are not going to see much of her while all this is going on, I’m afraid, unless you are a very involved father doing a lot of the changing and so on. And as for sex - sorry, forget it. Not for ages - she is going to be so exhausted with all that non-stop feeding and changing that she is not going to feel even slightly sexy for ages. Oh, on changing; a word of advice. On the basis that you obviously have romantic ideas about having twins, you are probably thinking of how cute they will look, dressed identically. First of all, if one is a boy and the other is a girl, this may not be altogether a good look, especially as they get bigger, and start to resent it, but secondly, consider the practicalities. Your poor wife is spending all day feeding and changing these babies, especially when one of them is slightly sick all down his or her nice clean outfit, or a fresh, clean nappy turns out not to be leakproof after all. So the baby with the clothing malfunction needs changing. And you want her to change the other one too, just so that they still look cute in their matching outfits?? Trust me, you won’t do that more than once or twice. I could go on, but I haven’t the heart. Mine are now nearly 34, so all this is a long time ago now, but it’s not quite a walk in the park even yet. You’ve got all the years to come of adjudicating between them and deciding whose fault something was; of being out-thought and outgunned when they decide to co-operate for once and turn the combined force of two concentrated minds and wills on you, and leave you giving in when you know full well that you shouldn’t; of having to decide which one to rescue, when they’ve both got themselves into slightly risky situations but in different directions; of trying to console one when the other has been invited to a party and they haven’t; of trying to support and encourage one who is never quite as good as the other at X; of trying to decide whether fairness and justice means treating them both exactly the same way, or respecting their individuality and giving them treatment that is equal but different. By the end of it, you will be exhausted. Yes, it is fun. But you wouldn’t believe (and won’t, unless or until it happens to you) just what hard work it can be. So be careful what you wish for. You might just get it. 7.6k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Atlassian Jira official site. One tool is enough to track issues & release great software. Try Jira for free.

Undo   Rikard Rodin , father of twins Answered Nov 17, 2015 · Author has 569 answers and 999.8k answer views Originally Answered: How can we have twins? Chances are increased by: a) Waiting until the mother is older before getting pregnant. Woman past 30 have a higher chance of having twins. Chances increase as women get older. b) IVF treatments often result in twins. c) Fraternal twins are the result of two eggs being fertilized by two separate sperm—so your chances are raised by having sex multiple times when the woman is fertile.... maybe—certainly worth a shot :) Beyond that it's luck... or attending a particular school that my wife attended in England during the early '80s. Of her small class of 15 or so students, 4 have had twins. Assuming half the class were boys, that's a nearly impossible statistic of 50%. My wife's bestfriend has twins and so do two of her other childhood friends—it's a bit surreal.  Another thing that's common between all these women is that they were all married for 5+ years before having children. Does that have anything to do with it? I have no idea. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters   Pooja P , BS Biomolecular Sciences & Gender Studies, University of Michigan (2020) Answered May 15, 2014 Originally Answered: How does one increase the chances of giving birth to twins? Well, you can't increase the probability of having identical twins, that is just random division. With fraternal twins, who are basically siblings born at the same time, you can do things to make it more likely that you will release two eggs at the same time. In a part of Africa, where they eat a lot of yams, they are more likely to have twins. Consuming more dairy also may increase chances. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are the least likely to have twins. Older women are less likely to have children overall, but if they do, they are more likely to have twins. People who are tall or slightly overweight have a higher chance of having twins. On the downside, people carrying twins are more likely to have problems like giving birth prematurely, or the babies are more likely to have birth defects. 927 Views   Gabrielle Andrew Answered May 17, 2014 Originally Answered: How does one increase the chances of giving birth to twins? By far the most successful technique may be employing a fertility treatment for your wife / female partner . The chances of having fraternal twins following ovulation stimulating therapies is greatly increased . Twins occur in nature one in 89 to 90 births The statistics vary according to clinic . Fertility doctors do not try to produce multiple births . However the incidence of twins is up to 10 times higher when ovulation stimulating treatments employed . If you want to go natural ... Select your partner carefully . Take a family history Are there many twins born on mothers side of the family ? Twins are to some extent heritable Also women who are somewhat older do tend to hyper ovulate just prior to menopause . Folate consumption is also favourable ( although it is recommended to reduce neural tube defects in all women intending to conceive .

You do realise that twin pregnancies and births carry greater risks for the mother and the babies, don’t you? This is why IVF clinics these days at times only implant one zygote. Although fertility drugs will increase the chance of multiple births, not just twins, I do not think any doctor would ethically prescribe them just so you can have twins. They would only prescribe them if you had been diagnosed with a fertility problem they were addressing. 207 Views · View Upvoters   Aileen Olsen Hampton , I have identical twin sons Answered Nov 22, 2015 · Author has 375 answers and 713.1k answer views Originally Answered: Are there some methods to increase chances of having twins? Take a drug that stimulates ovulation.  More ova available means a much higher probability of conceiving fraternal twins (or more!). Another method is in vitro fertilization.  Have two or more embryos implanted.  In this case, the opportunity for identical twins is increased, as well as fraternal; the reason is unknown.  But twins or more is favoured! Wait until the woman is older to have children.  Due to hormonal changes, older women have a stronger tendency to ovulate two ova rather than one ovum. Marry a woman or man who has twins running in their family.  There are hereditary links in both sexes, for both identical and fraternal twins, although the links for males and for identical twins are newer and not as well understood, nor as well known. Have twins.  Your odds for having another set goes up significantly. 626 Views   Caet Moir , Birth doula, volunteers with young parents and single moms Answered Nov 24, 2015 Originally Answered: Are there some methods to increase chances of having twins?

I agree with the answers here, but another two things increase the probability of twins:  Being black, and/or already having one biological child.  If you look at most people with twins, if they conceived naturally then they often have an older child as well. Good luck!  I have fraternal twin daughters and they're a blast! 529 Views   Eugenia Alegre Answered Apr 5, 2018 Originally Answered: Is there a way to improve the chance of having twins? You could begin a hormonal treatment, but these have long lasting health cosequences. It’s not worth it just for having an extra baby in your belly. Your children would prefer to have a healthy mother even if they are alone in there. If you are a man, there’s nothing you can do to increase your chance of twins. It depends entirely on your wife. If she releases more than one egg at the time of fertilization or one fertilized egg divides in two separate beings, then you’ll have twins. Otherwise, you’ll have a single baby. 10 Views   Daniel Super , Child free curmudgeon Answered Jul 5, 2017 · Author has 10.2k answers and 16.5m answer views Originally Answered: How can one have twins? “How can one have twins?” On purpose?

Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!!

Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

So… the odds aren’t exactly with you. Or are they? Turns out, there are a number of factors that can affect your odds of getting pregnant with multiples and having twin babies. These include your age, diet, number of pregnancies you’ve had, ethnicity, location, body type, and more. So what are your chancing of having twins or multiples? Take our just-for-fun quiz to find out instantly!  1. Do you have fraternal twins in your family?  Not that I know of  Yes, on my dad’s side  Yes, on my mom’s side  Yes, more than one set on my mom’s side 2. Are you overweight and/or taller than average?  Yes  No 3. What is your ethnicity?  Nigerian  African  Caucasian  Hispanic or Asian  Other 4. Where do you live?  Nigeria  Central Africa  North America or Europe  Latin America or Asia  Other 5. Do you eat a high fat diet?  Yep, full fat pastured yogurt, coconut oil, and pastured bacon  Yes, but it mostly comes from conventional animal products  I try to limit my consumption of fat 6. Do you frequently eat large amounts of phytoestrogen foods such as soy, tempeh, flax, sesame seeds, oats, barley, dried beans, lentils, yams, alfalfa, and mung beans?  Yes, I eat large servings of those foods daily  Sure, but not daily  No, I hardly ever eat those foods 7. How old are you?  Under 35  35-39  Over 40 8. How many full-term pregnancies have you had (including your current pregnancy)?  This is my first  2  3  4+ 9. Did you use fertility treatments to conceive?  Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Share          Expert Answer       The BabyCentre editorial team  Our panel of health writers     Non-identical (fraternal) twins tend to run in families. But identical twins don't.  Non-identical twins are the result of two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. There is a gene that makes a woman more likely to release two or more eggs during ovulation, and it's this gene that runs in families. Identical twins are the result of a single fertilised egg splitting, and this seems to be a random event.  So if you're a woman and non-identical twins run in your family, you're more likely to have a set yourself. It's estimated that you're about two and a half times more likely than average to have twins if you're a non-identical twin, or have siblings who are non-identical twins.  A man with a family history of twins may carry the gene, but it won't mean he can father a set of non-identical twins. The gene is only expressed through women who ovulate. If he has daughters, they may inherit the gene, and one day go on to have fraternal twins.  This may explain why some people think that twins skip a generation in families. You may have heard, for example, that if your mum or dad is a twin but you're not, you're more likely to have twins yourself. There's no evidence to support this. What can happen, though, is that a dad can pass on the non-identical twin gene to his daughters and this may make twins appear to skip a generation.  Your heritage can affect your chances of having twins. For example, non-identical twins are most common in women of Central African origin, and least common in women of South-East Asian and Latin American origin.  Aside from inheritance, age plays a big role in how likely you are to have twins. If you're a woman in your mid-30s or beyond, you have a greater chance than a younger woman of having twins or more. As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which could trigger your ovaries to release several eggs each month.  The use of some fertility treatments also increases the likelihood of a woman having twins. All treatments that stimulate the ovaries to release eggs or involve two or more embryos being transferred to the womb increase the chance of multiple births.

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Twins  Reproduction Does being a twin increase the likelihood of having twins? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 7 Answers Quora User , I've been a twin for...wait, how long?! Answered Apr 4, 2017 · Author has 784 answers and 1.5m answer views Thanks for the ask! Identical twins are a genetic “accident” so to speak (a really cool one), and there is no way to increase your chances there. From what I understand, several factors can increase the likelihood of having fraternal twins, including: Fertility treatments. Mom’s age -older women have more chances, and also more chances of other flukes, like genetic disorders :( History of twins on the expecting mother’s side -fraternal twins are not genetic, it’s all about two eggs being released at once. I’ve seen shirts that say “Real men make twins!” LOL if you have fraternal twins, you had nothing to do with it, buddy -not more than with any other baby, anyway. None of these factors were involved for my twin sister and me. We were surprises! Haha. One of us more than the other. It is known that twin births are becoming more common. My guess is it’s due to the increased effectiveness of fertility treatments, and the fact that in many cultures (like here in the U.S.) women are starting their families later, so there are more older women having kids. 2.8k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Nancy Dutton Bankston Related Questions More Answers Below What factors increase the chances of having fraternal twins?

Owens , Answered Feb 9, 2012 · Author has 343 answers and 1.4m answer views The probability of bearing fraternal twins is thought to be heritable, since it involves how many eggs a woman sheds at a time, which is a trait that is biologically based and might be subject to biological regulation. As you might expect from this hypothesis, some ethnic groups are known to have a higher probability of bearing fraternal twins than others. On the other hand, the probability of bearing identical twins is thought to not be heritable. Identical twins arise from rare, random "twinning" events early in embryological development. Therefore, if you are a woman and a fraternal twin, you *might* have inherited genes from your family that increase your chances of ovulating more than one egg at the same time, which would increase your chances of having twins. However, if you are an identical twin, you probably don't have an increased chance of having twins. 34.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Undo   Joy Ahmed , |Promoted and |Engineer Answered Jan 26, 2017 · Author has 404 answers and 1.4m answer views Time to dig out the family tree and have a think about your diet – these factors both increase your likelihood of having twins or multiples… Your family history Your lifestyle Number of children you have Maternal age Where you’re from Fertility treatment So, you’re TTC – and visualising yourself brandishing a dirty nappy while your partner wrangles with a babygro. That picture in your head includes one baby, not two or three, right? Thought so. Still, there are factors that can increase your likelihood of conceiving twins or multiples. ‘Identical twins, which make up around a third of twin pregnancies, come from one egg and are basically a fluke of nature – there’s no known common factor in those,’ says David Davies, consultant obstetrician at Portsmouth’s Queen Alexandra Hospital. ‘But with non-identical twins or triplets, which come from different eggs, there are several shared influences.’ From what you eat to the size of your family, get clued up on the likelihood that you’re going to need a bigger buggy. Your family history Yes, that’s your history, not his. In fact, even if your partner has twins in his family, it makes no difference. ‘It’s all about the woman because you’re the one producing the eggs, so if you or your mum are twins, or perhaps your sister has multiple babies, then you’ll be more likely to conceive more than one,’ says David. Your lifestyle Women who have a low-fat diet, especially vegans and vegetarians, are less likely to have multiples than someone who goes for the whole milk and tucks into steak every Friday. ‘The possible causes of this are subtle hormonal changes in people with these different diets, as well as perhaps someone with a higher fat diet having a higher body mass index (BMI) – that’s a measure for checking how healthy your weight is in relation to your height,’ says David. Number of children you have Chances are this is just a case of odds – the more children you’ve had, the more likely at some stage you’ll conceive multiples. The more children you’ve had, the more likely at some stage you’ll conceive multiples You’re simply giving yourself more opportunities to strike lucky. ‘There’s also the possibility that if you’ve always become pregnant easily in the past, you’re basically a good ovulator , so to speak’ says David. Maternal age Naturally conceived twins and triplets are more common in women in their 30s and 40s. ‘This is about the way your ovaries work and how their function changes with age, so you may release more than one egg each month,’ says David. Where you’re from Western Europe sees around one in 60 twin pregnancies, while they’re much more rare in South East Asia. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, twins make up one in every 20 or 30 pregnancies. ‘There are no real theories I’m aware of that would account for this, but interestingly if you’re Nigerian and living in another country, you’re less likely to conceive multiples than if you’re based in Nigeria – so perhaps it’s to do with diet or climate,’ says David. Fertility treatment One of the biggies that can boost your likelihood of having more than one child is having fertility treatment, such as IVF. ‘When IVF started to get really affective in the US during the 1970s and 1980s, twin rates pretty much doubled,’ says David. ‘It’s down to your body being given drugs to stimulate it to ovulate and produce eggs.’ 7.7k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by SunJour Healthcare Corporation UMOOZE is an all-natural dietary supplement for men with BPH.

Undo Anonymous Answered Aug 22, 2014 I have had 2 sets of Fraternal Twins, with the same father- so I know the textbook analysis is bunk  My ex-boyfried has fathered a total of 5 fraternal twins with 3 different women. All natural.  All but one set were intentional, by women who wanted to have the joy of having twins.  All 3 of his brothers also have at least 2 fraternal twins(so far!)   Some men are really more likely to have twins. Most women have multiple follicles maturing at the same time. One becomes dominant and the other dies out. But if the sperm are able to fertilize 2 eggs-before the non-dominant follicle dies out, then the woman may have conceived twins- and 9 months later may become a proud mama of twins. Some men have 30X the "typical" sperms.  Birth Control Pills do not work that well for these men. Their sperm lasts  9 days or so, and enter the uterus, even if the pill is supposed to stop them. The top 1% of the men have sperm quality that is 30X the "typical median" man.  The have more sperms, sperms with better morphology -  and more semen volume- even better Ph levels. My ex-boyfriend and his brothers are very healthy- they are of normal BMI- 32/33 inch waistline, no butter, beef or read meat  - no steroid use to bulk up. Probably explains their advantage over the red meat eating American- some of the American guys cannot even have sex in missionary position- So gross- and so likely to lead to infertility. Both my sets of twins were planned, and "I conceived in the first cycle of trying to concieve for both. First one was concieved at age 36 and the next one at age 42. I just felt it would be simpler to have 2 babies at once. I am financially independent- so having twins was a luxury I could afford. But many women who are not that financially strong also seem to want twins. I am surprised. 6.6k Views   Jeremy Miles , Father of MZ twins Answered Feb 10, 2012 · Author has 3.4k answers and 8.6m answer views To add a little to M. T. Owens 's answer, fraternal twins are inherited down the maternal line, so if you are female and your mother was a fraternal twin, you have a higher probability of producing fraternal twins. For identical twins, there have been a couple of cases where identical twins seemed to be passed down the patenal line - these families (in Denmark) were associated with male infertility as well. But it's usually the case that identical twinning is a random event (as far as anyone can tell). 8.5k Views · View Upvoters   Bruce Feldman , Twinless identical twin.

Ask New Question   Margaret Plotkin , Mother of three, including identical twins Answered Dec 18, 2016 · Author has 1.2k answers and 1m answer views If your father-in-law is an identical twin, this does not change your chances of conceiving twins, as identical twinning is simply random. If your father-in-law is a fraternal twin, this may slightly increase your chances, particularly if you are over age thirty, as increasing maternal age is one of the factors known to be associated with increased fraternal twinning. However, unless your husband’s family has a pronounced history of fraternal twins, the increased likelihood is still quite small. If you are truly anxious about producing twins, I suggest you get started making babies as early as possible, and opt for early ultrasound with fetal reduction should twins occur. There is nothing that can “make it impossible for twins to happen.” If having twins is truly unacceptable to you, you will have to be willing to end a twin pregnancy, in the unlikely event that you conceive twins. If that prospect is also unacceptable to you, then adopt a singleton. 698 Views promoted  by Boomerang for Gmail Your personal AI assistant for writing better emails.

There is not yet any documented understanding of how identical twinning could be passed through families, so your husband does not contribute to an increased chance of identical twins.

I agree with the other answer, your husband being a twin doesn’t change a thing. But since I bothered to write a longer answer, here is a summary of your odds of having twins: I have identical twin boys (now 20) so I’ve done a bit of reading on this. The chance of having identical twins is pretty much a constant. My recollection is that the chances are about 4 in 1000 births. The chance of having fraternal twins depends on a number of factors. I expect that all of these factors only apply to the mother since fraternal twins are due to multiple ovulations so anything that increases that will increase the likelihood of fraternal twins. Your chance of fraternal twins varies based on your race. My recollection that the base rate for Asians was 2 in 1000, for Blacks the chances were something like 8 in 1000 with Whites in the 4 or 5 per 1000 range. Your odds are increased if fraternal twins run in your family. I don’t remember a number for this but one site I just looked at quoted a 1 in 17 chance of having fraternal twins if you were a fraternal twin. I wouldn’t be surprised if you also had increased odds if your ancestors have had fraternal twins even if you aren’t a fraternal twin yourself. Next, the older the mother is the more likely she is to have fraternal twins. Lastly, fertility drugs increase the odds of having fraternal twins. With a little bit of googling you can get lots of statistics, but this is the basic overview. 670 Views promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Identical Twins  Twins If I'm a twin and my boyfriend is a twin, what are the chances of us having twins if I'm pregnant? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 1 Answer Quora User , Mum of 15yo fraternal twin boys Answered Apr 15, 2016 · Author has 1.5k answers and 7.3m answer views Your boyfriend being a twin is irrelevant; it can't influence your having twins one way or another. Identical twins occur spontaneously; the propensity for having identical twins isn't inherited; everybody's chances of having identical twins is the same - about 1 in 300 births. It's presently believed to be more of a "mechanical" than a genetic incident, caused by a spontaneous malfunctioning of early cell division, where the embryo splits into two in such a way as to spontaneously clone itself. The fact that it happens with the same incidence across all cultures and races, with no apparent familial pattern, supports the apparent lack of a genetic linkage. If you're a fraternal twin, where two embryos are formed by the fusion of two eggs with two sperm, then your mother was a double ovulator (i.e. had the capacity to release an egg from each ovary in a cycle, instead of just one egg from one ovary, as is more typical), and may have passed this propensity on to you, and you have a higher chance of also being a double ovulator, and thus of having fraternal twins yourself. The typical incidence of fraternal twins across the overall population is somewhere around 1 in 50 births; for you it is probably significantly higher than that. For you, your chances may be as high as somewhere around 1 in 10 births, given that you are known to be directly descended from a double ovulator.

Undo Answer Wiki 14 Answers Quora User , Certified Chilean Midwife. Answered Jan 29, 2016 · Author has 758 answers and 5.6m answer views Originally Answered: How can we have twins? Naturally? Nothing. Multiple pregnancies are a little bit of a phenomenon. Some women are genetically predisposed to multiple pregnancies but that's mostly because of irregularities in their cycle. Let me explain. During every menstrual cycle, many immature eggs will start to mature in the ovary. Eventually, one will be chosen to complete its development, preventing more from following the same path, and the end result will be the bursting of one follicle that will release one mature egg during ovulation. So, how it happens? There are 2 types of twins. Dizigotic and monozigotic. Dizigotic twins (Fraternal twins): Sometimes, a woman will mature 2 eggs instead of one. Why this happen, is basically because of higher levels of a hormone called gonadotropin. Some women are prone to higher levels of this hormone. So the release of 2 eggs instead of one occurs naturally in very sporadic cycles during her fertile years. Unless your partner is willing to undergo ovulation induction treatment to overstimulate her ovaries to mature several follicles instead of just one, or try in-vitro fertilization, there's no way to increase your chances of multiple pregnancy. Monozigotic twins (Identical twins): Monozigotic twins are a mystery. No one knows why it happens, but we do know how it happens. After fecundation, fast mitosis will occur inside the egg and progenitor cells will multiply. For some unknown reason, this single fecundated egg can collapse, splitting in 2 and forming 2 equal "primitive embryos" that will continue the process individually during its trip to the uterus (Before implantation) It can happen in day 0 - 3 after fecundation (20 - 30% of all monozigotic twins), it can happen after 4 - 8 days (70&) or it can happen 8 - 12 days after (1 - 5% of all monozigotic twins. At this point, that fecundated egg has become a trilaminar embryo, and if the separation is incomplete or happens on day 13, the twins will be conjoined) Because there's no real information about how this process happens, there's no way to know how to induce it. There's a technique used in IVF called embryo splitting that basically uses this concept to increase the number of embryos that are transferred to the womb. If you really, really desire to have twins, and your partner is fertile, then I would recommend ovulation induction treatment (Less invasive, but still risky). You can find more about this here. https://www.asrm.org/uploadedFil...

Ask New Question Quora User , I have had twins, and survived. Answered Jan 11, 2018 · Author has 5.8k answers and 8.9m answer views Originally Answered: How can I increase the chances of having baby twins? Well, you can try to go back in time and arrange to be born to a mother with a history of non-identical twins in the family. Non-identical twins tend to run in families, because they depend on the mother having a tendency to produce more than one egg at a time, but identical ones are pretty random, happening when a fertilised egg divides spontaneously and forms two embryos. There is absolutely nothing the father can do to influence either of these events, and the mother only if she has genes that make the two-egg situation slightly more likely. The only other answer is IVF. Failing that, you can cross your fingers and hope, if you really must. But trust me, you only think you want twins. You certainly haven’t thought beyond the “oh, they would be so cute!” or the “well, it would be convenient, two babies for the price of one pregnancy and one lot of labour!” stage. And believe me, there is a great deal more to it than that. Oh, and worse than that, I’ve just discovered that you’re a man, so you haven’t even considered the pregnancy and labour bit - you just think it’s a cute idea, for someone else to have twins for you!! Right, so you choose a prospective wife with a history of non-identical twins in the family, and tell her what a cute idea this would be. Let’s assume she still agrees to marry you, and she does, in due course, become pregnant with twins (or worse, of course. It could be triplets. Have you thought about that?). Actually, your Profile picture suggests there is already a lady in your life, so I hope she is up for this mad scheme of yours, because if it comes to fruition, most of the load is going to fall on her, at least initially. Firstly, your wife, or future wife, can look forward to a fairly uncomfortable pregnancy. Carrying around the weight of a growing baby is not much fun for most of us; you get heartburn, backache, glamorous things like varicose veins and haemorrhoids, and in later months you can’t even get enough sleep, because the pressure of the baby on your bladder means you have to keep getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. And now someone wants you to carry two babies around! Still, all that getting up in the night does help to prepare you for life after the birth. Or births. Let’s assume the births are perfectly straightforward (please try to time things so that your poor wife doesn’t have to carry these babies around in the middle of a heatwave; births in early spring would be much nicer than in the middle of the summer). Anyway, they’re here, everything has gone smoothly and they are both a reasonably good weight, and you’ve got them all home from the hospital. Now what? Well, you know (I hope) that new-born babies tend to need to be fed every 4 hours, right around the clock? So that’s likely to be about 8 feeds in a day, minimum (sometimes the gap is nearer 3 hours than 4, but let’s pretend). Only you’ve got two of them, so that’s 16 feeds every 24 hours, or possibly more. And they might wake up and want feeding at the same time (in which case you’ve got one yelling to be fed while the other is feeding; I hope you are going to do the cuddling, soothing and comforting while this goes on), or else (like mine) they will work watch and watch about, in which case it’s every 2 hours, not every 4. In between feeds of course, there will be changing of clothes, nappies and so on. Some days your poor wife will feel she has spent the past 24 hours doing absolutely nothing except feeding and changing. You are not going to see much of her while all this is going on, I’m afraid, unless you are a very involved father doing a lot of the changing and so on. And as for sex - sorry, forget it. Not for ages - she is going to be so exhausted with all that non-stop feeding and changing that she is not going to feel even slightly sexy for ages. Oh, on changing; a word of advice. On the basis that you obviously have romantic ideas about having twins, you are probably thinking of how cute they will look, dressed identically. First of all, if one is a boy and the other is a girl, this may not be altogether a good look, especially as they get bigger, and start to resent it, but secondly, consider the practicalities. Your poor wife is spending all day feeding and changing these babies, especially when one of them is slightly sick all down his or her nice clean outfit, or a fresh, clean nappy turns out not to be leakproof after all. So the baby with the clothing malfunction needs changing. And you want her to change the other one too, just so that they still look cute in their matching outfits?? Trust me, you won’t do that more than once or twice. I could go on, but I haven’t the heart. Mine are now nearly 34, so all this is a long time ago now, but it’s not quite a walk in the park even yet. You’ve got all the years to come of adjudicating between them and deciding whose fault something was; of being out-thought and outgunned when they decide to co-operate for once and turn the combined force of two concentrated minds and wills on you, and leave you giving in when you know full well that you shouldn’t; of having to decide which one to rescue, when they’ve both got themselves into slightly risky situations but in different directions; of trying to console one when the other has been invited to a party and they haven’t; of trying to support and encourage one who is never quite as good as the other at X; of trying to decide whether fairness and justice means treating them both exactly the same way, or respecting their individuality and giving them treatment that is equal but different. By the end of it, you will be exhausted. Yes, it is fun. But you wouldn’t believe (and won’t, unless or until it happens to you) just what hard work it can be. So be careful what you wish for.

Undo   Rikard Rodin , father of twins Answered Nov 17, 2015 · Author has 569 answers and 999.8k answer views Originally Answered: How can we have twins? Chances are increased by: a) Waiting until the mother is older before getting pregnant. Woman past 30 have a higher chance of having twins. Chances increase as women get older. b) IVF treatments often result in twins. c) Fraternal twins are the result of two eggs being fertilized by two separate sperm—so your chances are raised by having sex multiple times when the woman is fertile.... maybe—certainly worth a shot :) Beyond that it's luck... or attending a particular school that my wife attended in England during the early '80s. Of her small class of 15 or so students, 4 have had twins. Assuming half the class were boys, that's a nearly impossible statistic of 50%. My wife's bestfriend has twins and so do two of her other childhood friends—it's a bit surreal.  Another thing that's common between all these women is that they were all married for 5+ years before having children. Does that have anything to do with it? I have no idea. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters   Pooja P , BS Biomolecular Sciences & Gender Studies, University of Michigan (2020) Answered May 15, 2014 Originally Answered: How does one increase the chances of giving birth to twins? Well, you can't increase the probability of having identical twins, that is just random division. With fraternal twins, who are basically siblings born at the same time, you can do things to make it more likely that you will release two eggs at the same time. In a part of Africa, where they eat a lot of yams, they are more likely to have twins. Consuming more dairy also may increase chances. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are the least likely to have twins. Older women are less likely to have children overall, but if they do, they are more likely to have twins. People who are tall or slightly overweight have a higher chance of having twins. On the downside, people carrying twins are more likely to have problems like giving birth prematurely, or the babies are more likely to have birth defects. 927 Views   Gabrielle Andrew Answered May 17, 2014 Originally Answered: How does one increase the chances of giving birth to twins? By far the most successful technique may be employing a fertility treatment for your wife / female partner . The chances of having fraternal twins following ovulation stimulating therapies is greatly increased . Twins occur in nature one in 89 to 90 births The statistics vary according to clinic . Fertility doctors do not try to produce multiple births . However the incidence of twins is up to 10 times higher when ovulation stimulating treatments employed . If you want to go natural ... Select your partner carefully . Take a family history Are there many twins born on mothers side of the family ? Twins are to some extent heritable Also women who are somewhat older do tend to hyper ovulate just prior to menopause . Folate consumption is also favourable ( although it is recommended to reduce neural tube defects in all women intending to conceive .

You do realise that twin pregnancies and births carry greater risks for the mother and the babies, don’t you? This is why IVF clinics these days at times only implant one zygote. Although fertility drugs will increase the chance of multiple births, not just twins, I do not think any doctor would ethically prescribe them just so you can have twins. They would only prescribe them if you had been diagnosed with a fertility problem they were addressing. 207 Views · View Upvoters   Aileen Olsen Hampton , I have identical twin sons Answered Nov 22, 2015 · Author has 375 answers and 713.1k answer views Originally Answered: Are there some methods to increase chances of having twins? Take a drug that stimulates ovulation.  More ova available means a much higher probability of conceiving fraternal twins (or more!). Another method is in vitro fertilization.  Have two or more embryos implanted.  In this case, the opportunity for identical twins is increased, as well as fraternal; the reason is unknown.  But twins or more is favoured! Wait until the woman is older to have children.  Due to hormonal changes, older women have a stronger tendency to ovulate two ova rather than one ovum. Marry a woman or man who has twins running in their family.  There are hereditary links in both sexes, for both identical and fraternal twins, although the links for males and for identical twins are newer and not as well understood, nor as well known. Have twins.  Your odds for having another set goes up significantly. 626 Views   Caet Moir , Birth doula, volunteers with young parents and single moms Answered Nov 24, 2015 Originally Answered: Are there some methods to increase chances of having twins?

I agree with the answers here, but another two things increase the probability of twins:  Being black, and/or already having one biological child.  If you look at most people with twins, if they conceived naturally then they often have an older child as well. Good luck!  I have fraternal twin daughters and they're a blast! 529 Views   Eugenia Alegre Answered Apr 5, 2018 Originally Answered: Is there a way to improve the chance of having twins? You could begin a hormonal treatment, but these have long lasting health cosequences. It’s not worth it just for having an extra baby in your belly. Your children would prefer to have a healthy mother even if they are alone in there. If you are a man, there’s nothing you can do to increase your chance of twins. It depends entirely on your wife. If she releases more than one egg at the time of fertilization or one fertilized egg divides in two separate beings, then you’ll have twins. Otherwise, you’ll have a single baby. 10 Views   Daniel Super , Child free curmudgeon Answered Jul 5, 2017 · Author has 10.2k answers and 16.5m answer views Originally Answered: How can one have twins? “How can one have twins?” On purpose?

So… the odds aren’t exactly with you. Or are they? Turns out, there are a number of factors that can affect your odds of getting pregnant with multiples and having twin babies. These include your age, diet, number of pregnancies you’ve had, ethnicity, location, body type, and more. So what are your chancing of having twins or multiples? Take our just-for-fun quiz to find out instantly!  1. Do you have fraternal twins in your family?

Nigerian  African  Caucasian  Hispanic or Asian  Other 4. Where do you live?  Nigeria  Central Africa  North America or Europe  Latin America or Asia  Other 5. Do you eat a high fat diet?  Yep, full fat pastured yogurt, coconut oil, and pastured bacon  Yes, but it mostly comes from conventional animal products  I try to limit my consumption of fat 6. Do you frequently eat large amounts of phytoestrogen foods such as soy, tempeh, flax, sesame seeds, oats, barley, dried beans, lentils, yams, alfalfa, and mung beans?  Yes, I eat large servings of those foods daily  Sure, but not daily  No, I hardly ever eat those foods 7. How old are you?  Under 35  35-39  Over 40 8. How many full-term pregnancies have you had (including your current pregnancy)?  This is my first  2  3  4+ 9. Did you use fertility treatments to conceive?  Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

I am told you will need to eat more but when does that start? There does not seem to be a lot of information on twins and how you deal with health and changes over a single birth! I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .
