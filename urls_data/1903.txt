Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed.

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

Why do some young men have heart attacks? From Harvard Men's Health Watch   Published: November, 2009  Why do some young men have heart attacks—and what does this tell us about heart disease in middle age and beyond? The November 2009 issue of Harvard Men's Health Watch answers this question and more.  As many as 10% of all heart attacks in men occur before age 45. As with heart attacks in older adults, about 80% of these attacks stem from coronary artery disease—that is, cholesterol-filled blockages in the arteries that serve the heart. Other causes of early heart attacks in men include abnormalities of one or more arteries, blood clots that form elsewhere and are carried to the coronary arteries, disorders of the clotting system, spasm or inflammation of the arteries, chest trauma, and drug abuse.

Lead writer: Chris Woolston  February 29, 2016       Each year heart attacks kill more than 150,000 Americans, nearly half of them women. If such a grim statistic can have a bright side, it's this: Most heart attacks today aren't fatal.  About 75% of men and 60% of women live at least one year after an attack. Who is most at risk? While most heart attack victims are middle-aged or olderthe average age for a first attack is 66 for men and 70 for womenpeople in their 20s and 30s suffer attacks too. The risk of a heart attack climbs for men after age 45 and for women after age 55. When do heart attacks strike? Heart attacks occur roughly every 35 seconds in the United States, and most occur in the morning, a time when the platelets in the blood are especially "sticky" and prone to form clots. Early Warning Signs Heart attack symptoms can be subtle Watch video More on heart attack "I Stopped My Diabetes Meds and Had a Heart Attack" 10 Risk Factors for Heart Disease      At least one study, however, has found that morning isn't a prime time for heart attacks among people who regularly take aspirin, which helps keep platelets from sticking together. Beating the odds Survival odds for people who have had a heart attack keep getting better thanks to advances in diagnosis, medication, and lifesaving technology. It's worth noting that survival rates for heart attack patients are better on weekdays compared to weekends, because medical personnel are more likely to use invasive procedures (including angioplasty and bypass surgery) during the week. Nonetheless, cardiologists are optimistic about the rate of improvement in cardiac care. When Sharonne Hayes, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women's Heart Clinic, started practicing in the mid-1980s, doctors couldn't do much for people having heart attacks. "Now we can stop a heart attack in its tracks," she says. "Patients have a much better chance at recovery."

If blood flow isn’t restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die.  Heart attack treatment works best when it’s given right after symptoms occur. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, even if you’re not sure, call 9–1–1 right away .  Overview  Heart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.  When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis . The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.  Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.  If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.  Heart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery      Figure A is an overview of a heart and coronary artery showing damage (dead heart muscle) caused by a heart attack. Figure B is a cross-section of the coronary artery with plaque buildup and a blood clot.   A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.  Heart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias .  Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away.  Don't Wait--Get Help Quickly  Acting fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart. Treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur.    Many people aren't sure what's wrong when they are having symptoms of a heart attack. Some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:  Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.  Upper body discomfort. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).  Shortness of breath. This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.  Other possible symptoms of a heart attack include:  Breaking out in a cold sweat  Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)  Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting  Light-headedness or sudden dizziness  Any sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)  Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one.  Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  If you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care . Acting fast can save your life.  Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Take a nitroglycerin pill if your doctor has prescribed this type of treatment.                     Other Names                    Myocardial infarction (MI)  Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)  Acute coronary syndrome  Coronary thrombosis  Coronary occlusion                      Causes                    Coronary Heart Disease A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside of the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis . The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.

If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Coronary Artery Spasm A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis. What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn't always clear. A spasm may be related to: Taking certain drugs, such as cocaine Emotional stress or pain Exposure to extreme cold Cigarette smoking                     Risk Factors                    Certain risk factors make it more likely that you'll develop coronary heart disease (CHD) and have a heart attack. You can control many of these risk factors. Risk Factors You Can Control The major risk factors for a heart attack that you can control include: Smoking High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Overweight and obesity An unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium) Lack of routine physical activity High blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes Some of these risk factors—such as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar—tend to occur together. When they do, it's called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person who has metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone who doesn't have metabolic syndrome. For more information about the risk factors that are part of metabolic syndrome, go to the Health Topics Metabolic Syndrome article. Risk Factors You Can't Control Risk factors that you can't control include: Age. The risk of heart disease increases for men after age 45 and for women after age 55 (or after menopause). Family history of early heart disease. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age. Preeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah). This condition can develop during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure , and high blood pressure.                     Screening and Prevention                    Lowering your risk factors for coronary heart disease can help you prevent a heart attack. Even if you already have coronary heart disease, you still can take steps to lower your risk for a heart attack. These steps involve making heart-healthy lifestyle changes and getting ongoing medical care for related conditions that make heart attack more likely. Talk to your doctor about whether you may benefit from aspirin primary prevention , or using aspirin to help prevent your first heart attack.      Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes  A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent a heart attack and includes heart-healthy eating , being physically active , quitting smoking , managing stress , and managing your weight .  Ongoing Care  Treat Related Conditions  Treating conditions that make a heart attack more likely also can help lower your risk for a heart attack. These conditions may include:  Diabetes (high blood sugar). If you have diabetes, try to control your blood sugar level through diet and physical activity (as your doctor recommends). If needed, take medicine as prescribed.  High blood cholesterol . Your doctor may prescribe a statin medicine to lower your cholesterol if diet and exercise aren’t enough.  High blood pressure . Your doctor may prescribe medicine to keep your blood pressure under control.  Chronic kidney disease . Your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your high blood pressure or high blood sugar levels.  Peripheral artery disease . Your doctor may recommend surgery or procedures to unblock the affected arteries.  Have an Emergency Action Plan  Make sure that you have an emergency action plan in case you or someone in your family has a heart attack. This is very important if you’re at high risk for, or have already had, a heart attack.  Write down a list of medicines you are taking, medicines you are allergic to, your health care provider’s phone numbers (both during and after office hours), and contact information for a friend or relative. Keep the list in a handy place (for example, fill out this wallet card ) to share in a medical emergency.  Talk with your doctor about the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, when you should call 9–1–1, and steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive.                     Signs, Symptoms, and Complications                    Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic.  The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts:  Heart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours.  People who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones.  The most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort.  Women are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw.  Some people don't have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks.  Most Common Symptoms  The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:  Chest pain or discomfort.  Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. The feeling can be mild or severe.  Upper body discomfort.  You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).  Shortness of breath.  This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.  The symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease , usually when they're active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest.  Chest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack.  All chest pain should be checked by a doctor.  Other Common Signs and Symptoms  Pay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack:  Breaking out in a cold sweat  Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)  Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting  Light-headedness or sudden dizziness  Any sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)  Not everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur.  The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack.  Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowly—sometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack.  Any time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you're having a heart attack. Here's why:  Acting fast can save your life.  An ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital.  The 9–1–1 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you're not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life.  Every minute matters. Never delay calling 9–1–1 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help.                     Diagnosis                    Your doctor will diagnose a heart attack based on your signs and symptoms , your medical and family histories, and test results. Diagnostic Tests EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and signs of a previous or current heart attack. Blood Tests During a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. Higher than normal levels of these proteins suggest a heart attack. Commonly used blood tests include troponin tests, CK or CK–MB tests, and serum myoglobin tests. Blood tests often are repeated to check for changes over time. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. This test often is done during a heart attack to help find blockages in the coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through the coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels. If your doctor finds a blockage, he or she may recommend a procedure called percutaneous (per-ku-TA-ne-us) coronary intervention (PCI) , sometimes referred to as  coronary angioplasty  (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee). This procedure can help restore blood flow through a blocked artery . Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to help prevent blockages after the procedure.                     Treatment                    Early treatment for a heart attack can pr event or limit damage to the heart muscle. Acting fast, by calling 9–1–1 at the first symptoms of a heart attack, can save your life. Medical personnel can begin diagnosis and treatment even before you get to the hospital.  Immediate Treatment  Certain treatments usually are started right away if a heart attack is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed. These include:  Aspirin to prevent further blood clotting  Nitroglycerin to reduce your heart’s workload and improve blood flow through the coronary arteries  Oxygen therapy  Treatment for chest pain  Once the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed or strongly suspected, doctors start treatments promptly to try to restore blood flow through the blood vessels supplying the heart. The two main treatments are clot-busting medicines and percutaneous coronary intervention , also known as coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries.    Clot-Busting Medicines  Thrombolytic medicines, also called clot busters, are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. To work best, these medicines must be given within several hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Ideally, the medicine should be given as soon as possible.    Percutaneous Coronary Intervention  Percutaneous coronary intervention is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel, usually in the groin (upper thigh), to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon located at the tip of the catheter is inflated to compress the plaque and related clot against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps to keep the blood vessel open to prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after the procedure.  Other Treatments for Heart Attack  Other treatments for heart attack include:  Medicines  Medical procedures  Heart-healthy lifestyle changes  Cardiac rehabilitation    Medicines  Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines.  ACE inhibitors . ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also help slow down further weakening of the heart muscle.  Anticlotting medicines . Anticlotting medicines stop platelets from clumping together and forming unwanted blood clots. Examples of anticlotting medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel.  Anticoagulants . Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines also keep existing clots from getting larger.  Beta blockers . Beta blockers decrease your heart’s workload. These medicines also are used to relieve chest pain and discomfort and to help prevent another heart attack. Beta blockers also are used to treat arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).  Statin medicines . Statins control or lower your blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having another heart attack or stroke.  You also may be given medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, and treat arrhythmias. Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.    Medical Procedures  Coronary artery bypass grafting also may be used to treat a heart attack. During coronary artery bypass grafting, a surgeon removes a healthy artery or vein from your body. The artery or vein is then connected, or grafted, to bypass the blocked section of the coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This provides a new route for blood to flow to the heart muscle.    Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes  Treatment for a heart attack usually includes making heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor also may recommend:  Heart-healthy eating  Aiming for healthy weight  Managing stress  Physical activity  Quitting smoking  Taking these steps can lower your chances of having another heart attack.    Cardiac Rehabilitation  Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehabilitation (cardiac rehab) to help you recover from a heart attack and to help prevent another heart attack. Nearly everyone who has had a heart attack can benefit from rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.  The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.  Rehab has two parts:  Education, counseling, and training . This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future.  Exercise training . This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.                      Life After a Heart Attack                    Many people survive heart attacks and live active, full lives. If you get help quickly, treatment can limit damage to your heart muscle. Less heart damage improves your chances for a better quality of life after a heart attack. Medical Followup After a heart attack, you'll need treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD). This will help prevent another heart attack. Your doctor may recommend: Lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, being physically active , maintaining a healthy weight, and quitting smoking . Medicines to control chest pain or discomfort, high blood cholesterol , high blood pressure , and your heart's workload. Some of these medicines can help you prevent another heart attack. Anticlotting medicines, such as aspirin, that your doctor may prescribe to help you prevent another heart attack. A cardiac rehabilitation program If you find it hard to get your medicines or or complete your cardiac rehabilitation program, talk with your doctor. Don't stop the medicines or program because it can help you prevent another heart attack. Returning to Normal Activities After a heart attack, most people who don't have chest pain or discomfort or other problems can safely return to most of their normal activities within a few weeks. Most can begin walking right away. Sexual activity also can begin within a few weeks for most patients. Talk with your doctor about a safe schedule for returning to your normal routine. If allowed by State law, driving usually can begin within a week for most patients who don't have chest pain or discomfort or other disabling problems. Each State has rules about driving a motor vehicle following a serious illness. People who have complications shouldn't drive until their symptoms have been stable for a few weeks. Anxiety and Depression After a Heart Attack After a heart attack, many people worry about having another heart attack. Sometimes they feel depressed and have trouble adjusting to new lifestyle changes. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to life after a heart attack. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you. Risk of a Repeat Heart Attack Once you've had a heart attack, you're at higher risk for another one. Knowing the difference between angina and a heart attack is important. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have CHD. The pain from angina usually occurs after physical exertion and goes away in a few minutes when you rest or take medicine as directed. The pain from a heart attack usually is more severe than the pain from angina. Heart attack pain doesn't go away when you rest or take medicine. If you don't know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 9–1–1. The symptoms of a second heart attack may not be the same as those of a first heart attack. Don't take a chance if you're in doubt. Always call 9–1–1 right away if you or someone else has heart attack symptoms. Unfortunately, most heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms start before they seek medical help. This delay can result in lasting heart damage or death.

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease .

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

Identify your risk factors and take corrective action.  14-16 - High risk (15-19 percent) - You stand a good chance of having a first heart attack before you are 55, if male, and 65, if female.  If you have already had a heart attack, you are at high risk for a repeat performance.  Over 16 - Extreme risk (greater than 20 percent) - Unless you have a death wish, you have work to do. It will take time and effort to move to the lower risk categories.  Don’t bite off too much at one time. The process of change should be slow, committed, persistent, and permanent.

First study of blacks and whites reveals much higher risk over lifetime        January 24, 2012
					
						 | By Marla Paul         CHICAGO --- Will you have a heart attack or a stroke in your lifetime? Your odds may be worse than you think.  Men and women may have a false sense of security about their chances of having a heart attack or stroke based on the current practice of calculating a patient’s risk 10 years into the future. New Northwestern Medicine research shows a young or middle-aged adult who is at low risk in the short term may be at very high risk in the long term -- if he or she has just one or two risk factors such as higher than optimal cholesterol or blood pressure levels.  This is the first study to examine the lifetime risk of heart disease in white and black men and women. Previous studies have been in whites and predominantly males. It’s also the first study to look at the entire adult age spectrum. The research also looked at the risk across multiple birth cohorts and found the effect of the risk factors remained consistent regardless of the decade in which a person was born.  The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Part of the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project, the research tracks more than 250,000 participants from 18 different groups of people living in the community over a period of more than 50 years. The patients’ risk factors for cardiovascular disease -- blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status and diabetes status -- were measured at ages 45, 55, 65 and 75 years for each participant.  “We are giving incomplete and misleading risk information if we only focus on the next 10 years of someone’s life,” said principal investigator Donald Lloyd-Jones, MD, chair and associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. “With even just one risk factor, the likelihood is very large that someone will develop a major cardiovascular event that will kill them or substantially diminish their quality of life or health.”  The risk-factor profile was considered optimal when a participant had a total cholesterol level of less than 180 milligrams per deciliter and untreated blood pressure of less than 120 over less than 80, was a nonsmoker and did not have diabetes.  The new research on long-term risk may be important in estimating the future burden of cardiovascular disease in the general population, Lloyd-Jones noted.  Some key findings of the study:  Men who are 45 years old and have all risk factors at optimal levels have a 1.4 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke or other form of death from heart disease while having two or more risk factors hike the risk to 49.5 percent.  For 45-year-old women with all risk factors being optimal, the chance of having a heart attack or stroke in their lifetimes is 4.1 percent while having two or more risk factors boost it to 30.7 percent.  “Just even one small increase in risk, from all optimal risk factors to one that isn’t optimal, like slightly elevated cholesterol or blood pressure, significantly bumps up a person’s lifetime risk,” Lloyd-Jones said. (Non-optimal means a person doesn’t have diabetes and doesn’t smoke but either cholesterol is 180 to 199 or blood pressure is 120 to 130 on top or 80 to 89 on the bottom. These numbers aren’t at levels that need to be treated with medication, but they are still higher than desired.)  Women have a higher risk than men for a stroke over their lifetimes but a lower risk for a heart attack.  African-Americans have higher risk factors such as more hypertension and diabetes than whites, but because they also tend to die at younger ages, their lifetime risk of having a heart attack or stroke ends up being the same as whites.  “This study underscores the importance of lifestyle -- particularly diet, exercise and smoking cessation -- all the lifestyle patterns that are important in reducing the development of the risk factors in the first place,” said Jarett Berry, MD, who worked on the study when he was at Northwestern’s Feinberg School and is now assistant professor of medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  “We need to do a much better job of making sure these risk factors don’t develop in the first place, getting kids and young adults off to better starts so they don’t gain weight and are following healthier lifestyles throughout their lives,” Lloyd-Jones said.  Lloyd-Jones pointed out that maintaining the full package of optimal risk factors through middle age had a dramatic effect on the remainder of a person’s life. “It appears that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,” he said.  The research was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed.

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

If you are over 40, or if you have multiple risk factors, work especially closely with your doctor to address your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Heart attack prevention should begin early in life. Start with an assessment of your risk factors and a plan you can follow to keep your heart attack risk low. Prevention is critical, because many first-ever heart attacks are fatal or disabling. Learn Heart-Health Basics Reducing your risk starts with smart choices. If you smoke, stop. The American Heart Association has tools to help you quit . Work with your physician to manage your risk factors. These might include high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes . An active lifestyle and good nutrition have also been shown to be helpful in preventing heart attack. See more lifestyle tips for heart attack prevention.

Lead writer: Chris Woolston  February 29, 2016       Each year heart attacks kill more than 150,000 Americans, nearly half of them women. If such a grim statistic can have a bright side, it's this: Most heart attacks today aren't fatal.  About 75% of men and 60% of women live at least one year after an attack. Who is most at risk? While most heart attack victims are middle-aged or olderthe average age for a first attack is 66 for men and 70 for womenpeople in their 20s and 30s suffer attacks too. The risk of a heart attack climbs for men after age 45 and for women after age 55. When do heart attacks strike? Heart attacks occur roughly every 35 seconds in the United States, and most occur in the morning, a time when the platelets in the blood are especially "sticky" and prone to form clots. Early Warning Signs Heart attack symptoms can be subtle Watch video More on heart attack "I Stopped My Diabetes Meds and Had a Heart Attack" 10 Risk Factors for Heart Disease      At least one study, however, has found that morning isn't a prime time for heart attacks among people who regularly take aspirin, which helps keep platelets from sticking together. Beating the odds Survival odds for people who have had a heart attack keep getting better thanks to advances in diagnosis, medication, and lifesaving technology. It's worth noting that survival rates for heart attack patients are better on weekdays compared to weekends, because medical personnel are more likely to use invasive procedures (including angioplasty and bypass surgery) during the week. Nonetheless, cardiologists are optimistic about the rate of improvement in cardiac care. When Sharonne Hayes, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women's Heart Clinic, started practicing in the mid-1980s, doctors couldn't do much for people having heart attacks. "Now we can stop a heart attack in its tracks," she says. "Patients have a much better chance at recovery."

Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.  Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.      Symptoms Heart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have.  Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels (atherosclerotic disease) Cardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.  Symptoms can include:   Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)  Shortness of breath  Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed  Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back   You might not be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor. Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular evaluations.  Heart disease symptoms caused by abnormal heartbeats (heart arrhythmias) A heart arrhythmia is an abnormal heartbeat. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:   Fluttering in your chest  Racing heartbeat (tachycardia)  Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)  Chest pain or discomfort  Shortness of breath  Lightheadedness  Dizziness  Fainting (syncope) or near fainting   Heart disease symptoms caused by heart defects Serious congenital heart defects — defects you're born with — usually become evident soon after birth. Heart defect symptoms in children could include:   Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis)  Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes  In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain   Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:   Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity  Easily tiring during exercise or activity  Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet   Heart disease symptoms caused by weak heart muscle (dilated cardiomyopathy) In early stages of cardiomyopathy, you may have no symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:   Breathlessness with exertion or at rest  Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet  Fatigue  Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering  Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting   Heart disease symptoms caused by heart infections Endocarditis is an infection that affects the inner membrane that separates the chambers and valves of the heart (endocardium). Heart infection symptoms can include:   Fever  Shortness of breath  Weakness or fatigue  Swelling in your legs or abdomen  Changes in your heart rhythm  Dry or persistent cough  Skin rashes or unusual spots   Heart disease symptoms caused by valvular heart disease The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves — that open and close to direct blood flow through your heart. Valves may be damaged by a variety of conditions leading to narrowing (stenosis), leaking (regurgitation or insufficiency) or improper closing (prolapse).  Depending on which valve isn't working properly, valvular heart disease symptoms generally include:   Fatigue  Shortness of breath  Irregular heartbeat  Swollen feet or ankles  Chest pain  Fainting (syncope)   When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms:   Chest pain  Shortness of breath  Fainting   Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early, so talk to your doctor about your concerns regarding your heart health. If you're concerned about developing heart disease, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease.  If you think you may have heart disease, based on new signs or symptoms you're having, make an appointment to see your doctor.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes How the heart works    Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.     Your heart is a pump. It's a muscular organ about the size of your fist, situated slightly left of center in your chest. Your heart is divided into the right and the left side. The division prevents oxygen-rich blood from mixing with oxygen-poor blood. Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart after circulating through your body.   The right side of the heart, comprising the right atrium and ventricle, collects and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries.  The lungs refresh the blood with a new supply of oxygen. The lungs also breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste product.  Oxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, comprising the left atrium and ventricle.  The left side of the heart pumps blood through the aorta to supply tissues throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients.   Heart valves Four valves within your heart keep your blood moving the right way by opening only one way and only when they need to. To function properly, the valve must be formed properly, must open all the way and must close tightly so there's no leakage. The four valves are:   Tricuspid  Mitral  Pulmonary  Aortic   Heartbeats    The blueprints to your heart  Click here for an infographic to learn more   A beating heart contracts and relaxes in a continuous cycle.   During contraction (systole), your ventricles contract, forcing blood into the vessels to your lungs and body.  During relaxation (diastole), the ventricles are filled with blood coming from the upper chambers (left and right atria).   Electrical system Your heart's electrical wiring keeps it beating, which controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. This exchange keeps you alive.   Electrical impulses begin high in the right atrium and travel through specialized pathways to the ventricles, delivering the signal for the heart to pump.  The conduction system keeps your heart beating in a coordinated and normal rhythm, which keeps blood circulating.   Various heart disease causes The causes of heart disease vary by type of heart disease.  Causes of cardiovascular disease    Development of atherosclerosis Development of atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a process in which blood, fats such as cholesterol and other substances build up on your artery walls. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form. The deposits may narrow — or block — your arteries. These plaques can also rupture, causing a blood clot.     While cardiovascular disease can refer to different heart or blood vessel problems, the term is often used to mean damage to your heart or blood vessels by atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis), a buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries. Plaque buildup thickens and stiffens artery walls, which can inhibit blood flow through your arteries to your organs and tissues.  Atherosclerosis is also the most common cause of cardiovascular disease. It can be caused by correctable problems, such as an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, being overweight and smoking.  Causes of heart arrhythmia Common causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) or conditions that can lead to arrhythmias include:   Heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects)  Coronary artery disease  High blood pressure  Diabetes  Smoking  Excessive use of alcohol or caffeine  Drug abuse  Stress  Some over-the-counter medications, prescription medications, dietary supplements and herbal remedies  Valvular heart disease   In a healthy person with a normal, healthy heart, it's unlikely for a fatal arrhythmia to develop without some outside trigger, such as an electrical shock or the use of illegal drugs. That's primarily because a healthy person's heart is free from any abnormal conditions that cause an arrhythmia, such as an area of scarred tissue.  However, in a heart that's diseased or deformed, the heart's electrical impulses may not properly start or travel through the heart, making arrhythmias more likely to develop.  Causes of congenital heart defects Congenital heart defects usually develop while a baby is in the womb. Heart defects can develop as the heart develops, about a month after conception, changing the flow of blood in the heart. Some medical conditions, medications and genes may play a role in causing heart defects.  Heart defects can also develop in adults. As you age, your heart's structure can change, causing a heart defect.  Causes of cardiomyopathy The cause of cardiomyopathy, a thickening or enlarging of the heart muscle, may depend on the type:   Dilated cardiomyopathy. The cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown. It may be caused by reduced blood flow to the heart (ischemic heart disease) resulting from damage after a heart attack, infections, toxins and certain drugs. It may also be inherited from a parent. It usually enlarges (dilates) the left ventricle.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type, in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, usually is inherited. It can also develop over time because of high blood pressure or aging.  Restrictive cardiomyopathy. This least common type of cardiomyopathy, which causes the heart muscle to become rigid and less elastic, can occur for no known reason. Or it may be caused by diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, excessive iron buildup in your body (hemochromatosis), the buildup of abnormal proteins (amyloidosis) or by some cancer treatments.   Causes of heart infection A heart infection, such as endocarditis, is caused when an irritant, such as a bacterium, virus or chemical, reaches your heart muscle. The most common causes of heart infection include:   Bacteria  Viruses  Parasites   Causes of valvular heart disease There are many causes of diseases of your heart valves. You may be born with valvular disease, or the valves may be damaged by conditions such as:   Rheumatic fever  Infections (infectious endocarditis)  Connective tissue disorders   Risk factors Risk factors for developing heart disease include:   Age. Aging increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and weakened or thickened heart muscle.  Sex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. However, women's risk increases after menopause.  Family history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).  Smoking. Nicotine constricts your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers.  Certain chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy for cancer. Some chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapies may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Poor diet. A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.  High blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows.  High blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis.  Diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.  Obesity. Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors.  Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors, as well.  Stress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.  Poor hygiene. Not regularly washing your hands and not establishing other habits that can help prevent viral or bacterial infections can put you at risk of heart infections, especially if you already have an underlying heart condition. Poor dental health also may contribute to heart disease.   Complications Complications of heart disease include:   Heart failure. One of the most common complications of heart disease, heart failure occurs when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure can result from many forms of heart disease, including heart defects, cardiovascular disease, valvular heart disease, heart infections or cardiomyopathy.  Heart attack. A blood clot blocking the blood flow through a blood vessel that feeds the heart causes a heart attack, possibly damaging or destroying a part of the heart muscle. Atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack.  Stroke. The risk factors that lead to cardiovascular disease also can lead to an ischemic stroke, which happens when the arteries to your brain are narrowed or blocked so that too little blood reaches your brain. A stroke is a medical emergency — brain tissue begins to die within just a few minutes of a stroke.  Aneurysm. A serious complication that can occur anywhere in your body, an aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of your artery. If an aneurysm bursts, you may face life-threatening internal bleeding.  Peripheral artery disease. Atherosclerosis also can lead to peripheral artery disease. When you develop peripheral artery disease, your extremities — usually your legs — don't receive enough blood flow. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking (claudication).  Sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness, often caused by an arrhythmia. Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, it is fatal, resulting in sudden cardiac death.   Prevention Certain types of heart disease, such as heart defects, can't be prevented. However, you can help prevent many other types of heart disease by making the same lifestyle changes that can improve your heart disease, such as:   Quit smoking  Control other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes  Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week  Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat  Maintain a healthy weight  Reduce and manage stress  Practice good hygiene   By Mayo Clinic Staff    Heart disease care at Mayo Clinic   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Diagnosis & treatment  March 22, 2018    Share on: Facebook Twitter    References  What is cardiovascular disease?

Several online calculators have been developed to help estimate your odds.    The most commonly used heart attack calculator was developed by the Framingham Heart Study. A good one is the risk assessment tool made available by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute .    The newer Reynolds Risk Score , one for men and one for women, includes the Framingham variables plus family history and level of C-reactive protein.    The most comprehensive is the heart disease section of Your Disease Risk , originated at the Harvard School of Public Health and now hosted by Washington University School of Medicine.

  having a heart attack or stroke promises a 'wake-up call' to shock Britons 
  into changing lifestyles            A man holds his chest as he suffers from a heart attack (posed by model)  Photo: Alamy                  By Laura Donnelly , Health Editor   10:00PM GMT 08 Mar 2015   Follow        The NHS has launched a controversial calculator which predicts when you will have a heart attack or stroke - and compares a person’s “heart age” with their biological age. Health experts said the online tool would give individuals “a wake-up call” - pushing those at risk of heart disease into making lifestyle changes to protect themselves from the UK’s biggest killer. But some critics raised concerns about the accuracy of a “blunt tool” which tells every Briton they will have a heart attack or stroke one day, when many will not, and raised fears that the tool could be used to push millions more people into taking medication. They also expressed concern that individuals would be frightened by being given a prediction, much of which is based on factors beyond their control, such as their family history of disease. Last month a study found that some of the most widely-used risk calculators in use in the United States were exaggerating the risks of heart disease, by more than double. GPs will be asked to promote the new NHS calculator, in a bid to encourage patients to take steps to improve their health - such as losing weight, or giving up smoking – or to start taking medication to lower cholesterol and statins. The tool, which has launched online, asks individuals to provide basic facts – such as age height, weight, smoking – plus some details of their medical history, and whether relatives have suffered from heart disease before the age of 60.  Click here to take the test on a mobile   Experts behind the tool say it is most accurate if individuals can also provide readings of cholesterol and blood pressure levels. The calculator then provides an estimate of a person’s “heart age” – and most controversially, predicts when they will suffer a heart attack or stroke. It also provides the percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke within a decade. It means a woman of 41, with an unhealthy lifestyle, medical problems such as diabetes, and a family history of heart disease could be warned that she is likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke around the age of 51. Another woman the same age, with a different lifestyle and family history could be told she is likely to get to the age of 83 before being consigned to such a fate. A man of 50 who smokes, suffers a number of medical problems and a family history of heart disease, could be he told he is likely to have a heart attack or stroke at 56. A healthier man of the same age, with a different family history could expect to live to 79 without a heart attack or stroke, according to the calculator, which provides estimates to anyone over the age of 30. The calculator is a collaboration between NHS Choices, Public Health England and the British Heart Foundation (BHF). Professor John Deanfield, an NHS cardiologist who helped develop the tool, said: “Understanding your heart age can be a real wake up call for people who might be at risk. It can be that all important nudge to take action and make lifestyle changes to improve your heart health.” Dr Aseem Malhotra, Honorary consultant cardiologist, at Frimley Park Hospital, was far more cautious. He said: “It is important to help identify those at risk of heart disease, but I really hope this has been properly evaluated; we don’t want to make the same mistakes we have seen in the US, where calculators enormously exaggerated the risks.” He also raised concerns about whether the information would be used to scare millions more people into taking statins, amid heated arguments about the benefits and risks of the drugs. Last July, health watchdogs recommended that statins should be offered to around 17 million people – anyone estimated to have a 10 per cent chance of developing heart disease within a decade.   The tool provides the percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke within a decade (Getty)  Some doctors criticised the plans, fearing that the “mass medicalisation” of the public would put too many at risk of side-effects. Dr Malhotra said he was concerned that the new NHS tool does not take account of basic lifestyle factors – such as the type of diet people ate, and how much exercise they took. “It is a pretty crude evaluation to only use weight as a proxy for lifestyle,” he said. Coronary heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the UK and in 2013, more than 18,000 people died prematurely this way. Most deaths from coronary heart disease are caused by heart attacks with an average of 90,000 attacks in England per year. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: “Too many people are dying prematurely from preventable conditions and there is clear evidence that factors like smoking and high blood pressure play a major role in this.” He said the heart age tool helped people to see the “direct impact” that lifestyle changes could make on their heart’s health. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Knowing your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease is crucial to taking control of your health. Armed with this knowledge you can start to make lifestyle changes to help protect yourself against heart attacks and strokes.” The NHS is also developing a similar system of dementia screening , which aims to give middle-aged people their “brain age” and an estimate of how likely they are to develop conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.        telegraph.co.uk     Follow @telegraph                          Top news galleries       Woody Allen's 30 best one-liners          Comedy    Martin Chilton selects 30 great one-liners from the comedian and film

Save Everyday Health   Heart Health   Heart Health  The Single Best Predictor of a Heart Attack Previous Next   Each year close to 1.4 million Americans experience a heart attack , and more than 500,000 die from it. Strikingly, according to the Society for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, 50 to 70 percent of those who suffered fatal heart attacks were not even aware of their risk. Despite recent scientific advances in heart disease prevention, many high-risk patients are overlooked when conventional risk assessment methods such as cholesterol and blood pressure screenings are used alone. Here’s what you need to know about the No. 1 predictor of a heart attack, the calcium score, plus eight other risk factors to consider.   The Calcium Score A calcium score , obtained from a noninvasive computed tomography (CT) scan of your heart, is the measure of the amount of calcium in your coronary arteries. This number reflects the total amount of atherosclerotic plaque. It’s an indication of how all of your risk factors interact with each other to cause heart disease. The higher your calcium score for your age, the greater your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Many preventive cardiologists are recommending that asymptomatic men over age 40 and most postmenopausal women over age 50 have a heart scan to determine their calcium score, unless they have been determined by a doctor to be at very low risk. A calcium score of zero means you have no calcium deposits and a low risk of heart attack in the next five years. A score of 400 or more puts you at high risk of a heart attack within 10 years; a score of 1,000-plus means you have up to a 25 percent chance of having a heart attack within a year without medical treatment. The significance of a given score also depends on your age. For instance, if you’re 40 and have a score of 50, it indicates you are at high risk. If an 80-year-old has a score of 50, it indicates low risk because the atherosclerotic process has proceeded very slowly. If your score is high for your age, then your doctor may advise adopting a heart-healthy diet, such as the South Beach Diet, along with other lifestyle changes, and often medications, to improve your risk profile. It may be a statin to lower cholesterol and/or a medication to lower your blood pressure. You can get a CT scan for coronary calcium at most major medical centers, with the cost ranging from $99 to $399. The test takes about 10 minutes and radiation is minimal, about the same as a mammogram. Check with your insurance carrier to see if this test is covered.   Family History of Heart Disease If one or both of your parents died prematurely of a heart attack, it puts you at greater risk. Still, there are other factors to consider when it comes to family history . If your father smoked, rarely exercised, and ate a diet high in bad carbs and bad fats, his death could have been hastened by any or all of those factors. You may have been dealt a bad set of genes, but there’s a great deal you can do when it comes to lifestyle to reduce and even eliminate the familial risk. Often, medications are also needed to overcome the effect of bad genes. While, many people know the cardiovascular health of their parents influences their level of risk, they are unaware that the health of their siblings matters, too. If you have a brother or sister with cardiovascular disease, your own risk is increased by as much as 100 percent. In fact, if you grew up in the same household as your sibling, your sibling’s medical history is likely to be even more informative than your parents’. You and your brothers and sisters not only have similar genes, but you also ate similar food and grew up in the same environment.   Smoking and Heart Disease Risk At any age, smoking at least doubles your risk of heart disease. In fact, smoking can trigger a heart attack even if your arteries are nearly perfect. Once you light up, smoking narrows your arteries, raises your blood pressure, increases your risk of irregular heartbeat, and makes your blood sticky and more likely to clot. Smoking also lowers your HDL (“good”) cholesterol and increases arterial inflammation. This is the perfect recipe for a heart attack. If you smoke, and particularly if you have other risk factors for heart disease, each time you light a cigarette, you’re playing Russian roulette with your heart. A smoker who has high blood pressure and high LDL (“bad”) cholesterol has 14 times the normal risk of having cardiovascular disease. A woman who takes birth control pills (which increase the risk of blood clots) and who also smokes has a much greater risk of heart disease than does a woman who takes birth control pills but does not smoke. In young people with heart attacks, smoking is often the biggest culprit.   Diagnosis of Diabetes or Prediabetes If you are an American age 40 to 70, the odds are about 40 percent that you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes (also known as metabolic syndrome and typically characterized by increased waist circumference, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low good HDL cholesterol, and a mildly elevated blood sugar). Diabetes is such a strong risk factor for heart disease that medical professionals define it as a “coronary heart disease risk equivalent.” This means that a person with diabetes has the same high risk of a heart attack as someone who has already had one. Up to 70 percent of people in coronary care units have prediabetes or diabetes. Women, take note: If you have diabetes and have suffered a heart attack, you have an even greater risk of having another heart attack or heart failure than a man who has diabetes and has suffered a heart attack.   Waist Circumference and Your Heart The circumference of your waist is an indicator of your odds of having a heart attack or stroke. If you have an apple-shaped body and carry much of your weight around your middle, you are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease than if you have a pear-shaped body and store fat mainly in your buttocks and thighs, or evenly over your entire body. Studies have found that waist circumference is an excellent predictor of who will develop diabetes and heart disease. A waist circumference of more than 35 inches if you’re a women (and 40 inches if you’re a man) puts you at risk. Get rid of that extra belly fat through diet and exercise.   High Blood Pressure About one in three American adults has high blood pressure , also called hypertension. High blood pressure is currently defined as a reading of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, but guidelines regarding what constitutes “high” versus “normal” keep changing. Right now, blood pressure anywhere between 120/80 (normal) and 139/89 are labeled prehypertension. The American Heart Association estimates that 65 million Americans are in this category. It also estimates that people with prehypertension may be three times as likely to have a heart attack as those with normal blood pressure. Although blood pressure can vary from minute to minute with exercise, stress, sleep, and even changes in posture when at rest and relaxed, it should normally be less than 120/80 mm Hg for both men and women age 20 and older.   Cholesterol and Your Heart Total cholesterol, when considered alone, is a poor predictor of heart disease and heart attack. Studies show that total cholesterol levels among people who’ve had heart attacks are almost the same as those of people who haven’t, and that roughly half of heart attacks occur in people without high cholesterol . If you have other risk factors for heart disease, particularly a family history, having your HDL and LDL particle size measured with an advanced blood test will give you a far clearer picture of your heart risk than the conventional lipid panel. Having a lot of large particles cuts your risk for a heart attack, while having a lot of small ones raises it. You do not want more than 15 percent of your particles to be the small, dense type.   Triglycerides and Your Heart Triglycerides are the form in which fat is stored in your body’s fat cells. Your triglyceride level is almost always strongly influenced by lifestyle. If you have high triglycerides (over 150 mg/dL is borderline high) and low HDL (less than 40 mg/dL if you’re a man and less than 50 mg/dL if you’re a woman), your risk of heart disease is compounded. To find out if you have this added risk, divide your triglyceride count by your HDL count. Ideally, the resulting number will be 2 or lower. For example, if your triglyceride level is 200 and your HDL is 40, divide 200 by 40 and you get 5. This is much higher than the desirable ratio, and it tells you that you have a heightened risk of a heart attack that will need to be addressed. Your triglyceride level can also offer insight into your LDL particle size. In general, the higher your triglycerides and the lower your HDL, the smaller and denser your LDL and the greater your risk of heart disease. If your triglycerides are higher than 200 and your HDL is lower than 45, it is likely that you have too many small, dense LDL particles.   A Sedentary Lifestyle and Your Heart A life with little to no physical activity leads to a number of undesirable body changes. Your blood pressure goes up, your triglycerides increase, your level of good HDL falls (this is why triglycerides and HDL are often called the “lifestyle” numbers), and you are more likely to gain weight, especially around your midsection. This is a picture of a heart attack in the making. No wonder the AARP recently called sitting the new smoking. The sad news is that two-thirds of American adults report that they are physically inactive — that is, they are sedentary most of the time. It’s time to get up and get moving .   What You Can Do to Improve Your Heart Disease Risk Factors Beyond understanding your risk factors, getting the correct tests, and taking medications as prescribed, the most important step you can take to minimize your risk of heart attack and sudden death is to engage in a healthy lifestyle. That means shedding any extra pounds by adopting a heart-healthy diet, like the South Beach Diet, that focuses on nutrient-dense, fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in addition to good fats and lean protein. It means making time for at least 20 minutes of aerobic or core-strengthening exercise most days of the week . And it means getting plenty of restorative sleep. Not only will these three steps help you lose weight and keep it off (yes, lack of sleep promotes weight gain), they will also help lower your blood pressure, improve insulin resistance in those with prediabetes and diabetes, and counter most of the other risk factors you’ve just read about. It’s an encouraging fact: The earlier you start making these healthy lifestyle changes, the better your chances of avoiding a heart attack down the road.

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease .

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

If you are over 40, or if you have multiple risk factors, work especially closely with your doctor to address your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Heart attack prevention should begin early in life. Start with an assessment of your risk factors and a plan you can follow to keep your heart attack risk low. Prevention is critical, because many first-ever heart attacks are fatal or disabling. Learn Heart-Health Basics Reducing your risk starts with smart choices. If you smoke, stop. The American Heart Association has tools to help you quit . Work with your physician to manage your risk factors. These might include high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes .

Why do some young men have heart attacks? From Harvard Men's Health Watch   Published: November, 2009  Why do some young men have heart attacks—and what does this tell us about heart disease in middle age and beyond? The November 2009 issue of Harvard Men's Health Watch answers this question and more.  As many as 10% of all heart attacks in men occur before age 45. As with heart attacks in older adults, about 80% of these attacks stem from coronary artery disease—that is, cholesterol-filled blockages in the arteries that serve the heart. Other causes of early heart attacks in men include abnormalities of one or more arteries, blood clots that form elsewhere and are carried to the coronary arteries, disorders of the clotting system, spasm or inflammation of the arteries, chest trauma, and drug abuse.

Lead writer: Chris Woolston  February 29, 2016       Each year heart attacks kill more than 150,000 Americans, nearly half of them women. If such a grim statistic can have a bright side, it's this: Most heart attacks today aren't fatal.  About 75% of men and 60% of women live at least one year after an attack. Who is most at risk? While most heart attack victims are middle-aged or olderthe average age for a first attack is 66 for men and 70 for womenpeople in their 20s and 30s suffer attacks too. The risk of a heart attack climbs for men after age 45 and for women after age 55. When do heart attacks strike? Heart attacks occur roughly every 35 seconds in the United States, and most occur in the morning, a time when the platelets in the blood are especially "sticky" and prone to form clots. Early Warning Signs Heart attack symptoms can be subtle Watch video More on heart attack "I Stopped My Diabetes Meds and Had a Heart Attack" 10 Risk Factors for Heart Disease      At least one study, however, has found that morning isn't a prime time for heart attacks among people who regularly take aspirin, which helps keep platelets from sticking together. Beating the odds Survival odds for people who have had a heart attack keep getting better thanks to advances in diagnosis, medication, and lifesaving technology. It's worth noting that survival rates for heart attack patients are better on weekdays compared to weekends, because medical personnel are more likely to use invasive procedures (including angioplasty and bypass surgery) during the week. Nonetheless, cardiologists are optimistic about the rate of improvement in cardiac care. When Sharonne Hayes, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women's Heart Clinic, started practicing in the mid-1980s, doctors couldn't do much for people having heart attacks. "Now we can stop a heart attack in its tracks," she says. "Patients have a much better chance at recovery."

If blood flow isn’t restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die.  Heart attack treatment works best when it’s given right after symptoms occur. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, even if you’re not sure, call 9–1–1 right away .  Overview  Heart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.  When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis . The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.  Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.  If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.  Heart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery      Figure A is an overview of a heart and coronary artery showing damage (dead heart muscle) caused by a heart attack. Figure B is a cross-section of the coronary artery with plaque buildup and a blood clot.   A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.  Heart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias .  Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away.  Don't Wait--Get Help Quickly  Acting fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart. Treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur.    Many people aren't sure what's wrong when they are having symptoms of a heart attack. Some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:  Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.  Upper body discomfort. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).  Shortness of breath. This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.  Other possible symptoms of a heart attack include:  Breaking out in a cold sweat  Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)  Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting  Light-headedness or sudden dizziness  Any sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)  Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one.  Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  If you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care . Acting fast can save your life.  Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Take a nitroglycerin pill if your doctor has prescribed this type of treatment.                     Other Names                    Myocardial infarction (MI)  Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)  Acute coronary syndrome  Coronary thrombosis  Coronary occlusion                      Causes                    Coronary Heart Disease A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen.

This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Coronary Artery Spasm A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis. What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn't always clear. A spasm may be related to: Taking certain drugs, such as cocaine Emotional stress or pain Exposure to extreme cold Cigarette smoking                     Risk Factors                    Certain risk factors make it more likely that you'll develop coronary heart disease (CHD) and have a heart attack. You can control many of these risk factors. Risk Factors You Can Control The major risk factors for a heart attack that you can control include: Smoking High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Overweight and obesity An unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium) Lack of routine physical activity High blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes Some of these risk factors—such as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar—tend to occur together. When they do, it's called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person who has metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone who doesn't have metabolic syndrome. For more information about the risk factors that are part of metabolic syndrome, go to the Health Topics Metabolic Syndrome article. Risk Factors You Can't Control Risk factors that you can't control include: Age. The risk of heart disease increases for men after age 45 and for women after age 55 (or after menopause). Family history of early heart disease. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age. Preeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah). This condition can develop during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure , and high blood pressure.                     Screening and Prevention                    Lowering your risk factors for coronary heart disease can help you prevent a heart attack. Even if you already have coronary heart disease, you still can take steps to lower your risk for a heart attack. These steps involve making heart-healthy lifestyle changes and getting ongoing medical care for related conditions that make heart attack more likely. Talk to your doctor about whether you may benefit from aspirin primary prevention , or using aspirin to help prevent your first heart attack.      Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes  A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent a heart attack and includes heart-healthy eating , being physically active , quitting smoking , managing stress , and managing your weight .  Ongoing Care  Treat Related Conditions  Treating conditions that make a heart attack more likely also can help lower your risk for a heart attack. These conditions may include:  Diabetes (high blood sugar). If you have diabetes, try to control your blood sugar level through diet and physical activity (as your doctor recommends). If needed, take medicine as prescribed.  High blood cholesterol . Your doctor may prescribe a statin medicine to lower your cholesterol if diet and exercise aren’t enough.  High blood pressure . Your doctor may prescribe medicine to keep your blood pressure under control.  Chronic kidney disease . Your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your high blood pressure or high blood sugar levels.  Peripheral artery disease . Your doctor may recommend surgery or procedures to unblock the affected arteries.  Have an Emergency Action Plan  Make sure that you have an emergency action plan in case you or someone in your family has a heart attack. This is very important if you’re at high risk for, or have already had, a heart attack.  Write down a list of medicines you are taking, medicines you are allergic to, your health care provider’s phone numbers (both during and after office hours), and contact information for a friend or relative. Keep the list in a handy place (for example, fill out this wallet card ) to share in a medical emergency.  Talk with your doctor about the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, when you should call 9–1–1, and steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive.                     Signs, Symptoms, and Complications                    Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic.  The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts:  Heart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours.  People who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones.  The most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort.  Women are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw.  Some people don't have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks.  Most Common Symptoms  The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:  Chest pain or discomfort.  Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. The feeling can be mild or severe.  Upper body discomfort.  You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).  Shortness of breath.  This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.  The symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease , usually when they're active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest.  Chest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack.  All chest pain should be checked by a doctor.  Other Common Signs and Symptoms  Pay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack:  Breaking out in a cold sweat  Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)  Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting  Light-headedness or sudden dizziness  Any sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)  Not everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur.  The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack.  Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowly—sometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack.  Any time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you're having a heart attack. Here's why:  Acting fast can save your life.  An ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital.  The 9–1–1 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you're not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life.  Every minute matters. Never delay calling 9–1–1 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help.                     Diagnosis                    Your doctor will diagnose a heart attack based on your signs and symptoms , your medical and family histories, and test results. Diagnostic Tests EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and signs of a previous or current heart attack. Blood Tests During a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. Higher than normal levels of these proteins suggest a heart attack. Commonly used blood tests include troponin tests, CK or CK–MB tests, and serum myoglobin tests. Blood tests often are repeated to check for changes over time. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. This test often is done during a heart attack to help find blockages in the coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through the coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels. If your doctor finds a blockage, he or she may recommend a procedure called percutaneous (per-ku-TA-ne-us) coronary intervention (PCI) , sometimes referred to as  coronary angioplasty  (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee). This procedure can help restore blood flow through a blocked artery . Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to help prevent blockages after the procedure.                     Treatment                    Early treatment for a heart attack can pr event or limit damage to the heart muscle. Acting fast, by calling 9–1–1 at the first symptoms of a heart attack, can save your life. Medical personnel can begin diagnosis and treatment even before you get to the hospital.  Immediate Treatment  Certain treatments usually are started right away if a heart attack is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed. These include:  Aspirin to prevent further blood clotting  Nitroglycerin to reduce your heart’s workload and improve blood flow through the coronary arteries  Oxygen therapy  Treatment for chest pain  Once the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed or strongly suspected, doctors start treatments promptly to try to restore blood flow through the blood vessels supplying the heart. The two main treatments are clot-busting medicines and percutaneous coronary intervention , also known as coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries.    Clot-Busting Medicines  Thrombolytic medicines, also called clot busters, are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. To work best, these medicines must be given within several hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Ideally, the medicine should be given as soon as possible.    Percutaneous Coronary Intervention  Percutaneous coronary intervention is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel, usually in the groin (upper thigh), to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon located at the tip of the catheter is inflated to compress the plaque and related clot against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps to keep the blood vessel open to prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after the procedure.  Other Treatments for Heart Attack  Other treatments for heart attack include:  Medicines  Medical procedures  Heart-healthy lifestyle changes  Cardiac rehabilitation    Medicines  Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines.  ACE inhibitors . ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also help slow down further weakening of the heart muscle.  Anticlotting medicines . Anticlotting medicines stop platelets from clumping together and forming unwanted blood clots. Examples of anticlotting medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel.  Anticoagulants . Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines also keep existing clots from getting larger.  Beta blockers . Beta blockers decrease your heart’s workload. These medicines also are used to relieve chest pain and discomfort and to help prevent another heart attack. Beta blockers also are used to treat arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).  Statin medicines . Statins control or lower your blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having another heart attack or stroke.  You also may be given medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, and treat arrhythmias. Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.    Medical Procedures  Coronary artery bypass grafting also may be used to treat a heart attack. During coronary artery bypass grafting, a surgeon removes a healthy artery or vein from your body. The artery or vein is then connected, or grafted, to bypass the blocked section of the coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This provides a new route for blood to flow to the heart muscle.    Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes  Treatment for a heart attack usually includes making heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor also may recommend:  Heart-healthy eating  Aiming for healthy weight  Managing stress  Physical activity  Quitting smoking  Taking these steps can lower your chances of having another heart attack.    Cardiac Rehabilitation  Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehabilitation (cardiac rehab) to help you recover from a heart attack and to help prevent another heart attack. Nearly everyone who has had a heart attack can benefit from rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.  The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.  Rehab has two parts:  Education, counseling, and training . This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future.  Exercise training . This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.                      Life After a Heart Attack                    Many people survive heart attacks and live active, full lives. If you get help quickly, treatment can limit damage to your heart muscle. Less heart damage improves your chances for a better quality of life after a heart attack. Medical Followup After a heart attack, you'll need treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD). This will help prevent another heart attack. Your doctor may recommend: Lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, being physically active , maintaining a healthy weight, and quitting smoking . Medicines to control chest pain or discomfort, high blood cholesterol , high blood pressure , and your heart's workload. Some of these medicines can help you prevent another heart attack. Anticlotting medicines, such as aspirin, that your doctor may prescribe to help you prevent another heart attack. A cardiac rehabilitation program If you find it hard to get your medicines or or complete your cardiac rehabilitation program, talk with your doctor. Don't stop the medicines or program because it can help you prevent another heart attack. Returning to Normal Activities After a heart attack, most people who don't have chest pain or discomfort or other problems can safely return to most of their normal activities within a few weeks. Most can begin walking right away. Sexual activity also can begin within a few weeks for most patients. Talk with your doctor about a safe schedule for returning to your normal routine. If allowed by State law, driving usually can begin within a week for most patients who don't have chest pain or discomfort or other disabling problems. Each State has rules about driving a motor vehicle following a serious illness. People who have complications shouldn't drive until their symptoms have been stable for a few weeks. Anxiety and Depression After a Heart Attack After a heart attack, many people worry about having another heart attack. Sometimes they feel depressed and have trouble adjusting to new lifestyle changes. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to life after a heart attack. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you. Risk of a Repeat Heart Attack Once you've had a heart attack, you're at higher risk for another one. Knowing the difference between angina and a heart attack is important. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have CHD. The pain from angina usually occurs after physical exertion and goes away in a few minutes when you rest or take medicine as directed. The pain from a heart attack usually is more severe than the pain from angina. Heart attack pain doesn't go away when you rest or take medicine. If you don't know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 9–1–1. The symptoms of a second heart attack may not be the same as those of a first heart attack. Don't take a chance if you're in doubt. Always call 9–1–1 right away if you or someone else has heart attack symptoms. Unfortunately, most heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms start before they seek medical help. This delay can result in lasting heart damage or death.

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease .

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

If you are over 40, or if you have multiple risk factors, work especially closely with your doctor to address your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Heart attack prevention should begin early in life. Start with an assessment of your risk factors and a plan you can follow to keep your heart attack risk low. Prevention is critical, because many first-ever heart attacks are fatal or disabling. Learn Heart-Health Basics Reducing your risk starts with smart choices. If you smoke, stop. The American Heart Association has tools to help you quit . Work with your physician to manage your risk factors. These might include high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes . An active lifestyle and good nutrition have also been shown to be helpful in preventing heart attack. See more lifestyle tips for heart attack prevention.

If you pay attention, you will live a long, healthy, active, and productive life.  10-13 - Moderate risk (9-14 percent) - You do some things right, but you have work to do. Identify your risk factors and take corrective action.  14-16 - High risk (15-19 percent) - You stand a good chance of having a first heart attack before you are 55, if male, and 65, if female.  If you have already had a heart attack, you are at high risk for a repeat performance.  Over 16 - Extreme risk (greater than 20 percent) - Unless you have a death wish, you have work to do. It will take time and effort to move to the lower risk categories.  Don’t bite off too much at one time. The process of change should be slow, committed, persistent, and permanent.

First study of blacks and whites reveals much higher risk over lifetime        January 24, 2012
					
						 | By Marla Paul         CHICAGO --- Will you have a heart attack or a stroke in your lifetime? Your odds may be worse than you think.  Men and women may have a false sense of security about their chances of having a heart attack or stroke based on the current practice of calculating a patient’s risk 10 years into the future. New Northwestern Medicine research shows a young or middle-aged adult who is at low risk in the short term may be at very high risk in the long term -- if he or she has just one or two risk factors such as higher than optimal cholesterol or blood pressure levels.  This is the first study to examine the lifetime risk of heart disease in white and black men and women. Previous studies have been in whites and predominantly males. It’s also the first study to look at the entire adult age spectrum. The research also looked at the risk across multiple birth cohorts and found the effect of the risk factors remained consistent regardless of the decade in which a person was born.  The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Part of the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project, the research tracks more than 250,000 participants from 18 different groups of people living in the community over a period of more than 50 years. The patients’ risk factors for cardiovascular disease -- blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status and diabetes status -- were measured at ages 45, 55, 65 and 75 years for each participant.  “We are giving incomplete and misleading risk information if we only focus on the next 10 years of someone’s life,” said principal investigator Donald Lloyd-Jones, MD, chair and associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. “With even just one risk factor, the likelihood is very large that someone will develop a major cardiovascular event that will kill them or substantially diminish their quality of life or health.”  The risk-factor profile was considered optimal when a participant had a total cholesterol level of less than 180 milligrams per deciliter and untreated blood pressure of less than 120 over less than 80, was a nonsmoker and did not have diabetes.  The new research on long-term risk may be important in estimating the future burden of cardiovascular disease in the general population, Lloyd-Jones noted.  Some key findings of the study:  Men who are 45 years old and have all risk factors at optimal levels have a 1.4 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke or other form of death from heart disease while having two or more risk factors hike the risk to 49.5 percent.  For 45-year-old women with all risk factors being optimal, the chance of having a heart attack or stroke in their lifetimes is 4.1 percent while having two or more risk factors boost it to 30.7 percent.  “Just even one small increase in risk, from all optimal risk factors to one that isn’t optimal, like slightly elevated cholesterol or blood pressure, significantly bumps up a person’s lifetime risk,” Lloyd-Jones said. (Non-optimal means a person doesn’t have diabetes and doesn’t smoke but either cholesterol is 180 to 199 or blood pressure is 120 to 130 on top or 80 to 89 on the bottom. These numbers aren’t at levels that need to be treated with medication, but they are still higher than desired.)  Women have a higher risk than men for a stroke over their lifetimes but a lower risk for a heart attack.  African-Americans have higher risk factors such as more hypertension and diabetes than whites, but because they also tend to die at younger ages, their lifetime risk of having a heart attack or stroke ends up being the same as whites.  “This study underscores the importance of lifestyle -- particularly diet, exercise and smoking cessation -- all the lifestyle patterns that are important in reducing the development of the risk factors in the first place,” said Jarett Berry, MD, who worked on the study when he was at Northwestern’s Feinberg School and is now assistant professor of medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  “We need to do a much better job of making sure these risk factors don’t develop in the first place, getting kids and young adults off to better starts so they don’t gain weight and are following healthier lifestyles throughout their lives,” Lloyd-Jones said.  Lloyd-Jones pointed out that maintaining the full package of optimal risk factors through middle age had a dramatic effect on the remainder of a person’s life. “It appears that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,” he said.  The research was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed.

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

If you are over 40, or if you have multiple risk factors, work especially closely with your doctor to address your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Heart attack prevention should begin early in life. Start with an assessment of your risk factors and a plan you can follow to keep your heart attack risk low. Prevention is critical, because many first-ever heart attacks are fatal or disabling. Learn Heart-Health Basics Reducing your risk starts with smart choices. If you smoke, stop. The American Heart Association has tools to help you quit . Work with your physician to manage your risk factors. These might include high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes . An active lifestyle and good nutrition have also been shown to be helpful in preventing heart attack. See more lifestyle tips for heart attack prevention.

Lead writer: Chris Woolston  February 29, 2016       Each year heart attacks kill more than 150,000 Americans, nearly half of them women. If such a grim statistic can have a bright side, it's this: Most heart attacks today aren't fatal.  About 75% of men and 60% of women live at least one year after an attack. Who is most at risk? While most heart attack victims are middle-aged or olderthe average age for a first attack is 66 for men and 70 for womenpeople in their 20s and 30s suffer attacks too. The risk of a heart attack climbs for men after age 45 and for women after age 55. When do heart attacks strike? Heart attacks occur roughly every 35 seconds in the United States, and most occur in the morning, a time when the platelets in the blood are especially "sticky" and prone to form clots. Early Warning Signs Heart attack symptoms can be subtle Watch video More on heart attack "I Stopped My Diabetes Meds and Had a Heart Attack" 10 Risk Factors for Heart Disease      At least one study, however, has found that morning isn't a prime time for heart attacks among people who regularly take aspirin, which helps keep platelets from sticking together. Beating the odds Survival odds for people who have had a heart attack keep getting better thanks to advances in diagnosis, medication, and lifesaving technology. It's worth noting that survival rates for heart attack patients are better on weekdays compared to weekends, because medical personnel are more likely to use invasive procedures (including angioplasty and bypass surgery) during the week. Nonetheless, cardiologists are optimistic about the rate of improvement in cardiac care. When Sharonne Hayes, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women's Heart Clinic, started practicing in the mid-1980s, doctors couldn't do much for people having heart attacks. "Now we can stop a heart attack in its tracks," she says. "Patients have a much better chance at recovery."

Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.  Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.      Symptoms Heart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have.  Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels (atherosclerotic disease) Cardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.  Symptoms can include:   Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)  Shortness of breath  Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed  Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back   You might not be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor. Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular evaluations.  Heart disease symptoms caused by abnormal heartbeats (heart arrhythmias) A heart arrhythmia is an abnormal heartbeat. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:   Fluttering in your chest  Racing heartbeat (tachycardia)  Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)  Chest pain or discomfort  Shortness of breath  Lightheadedness  Dizziness  Fainting (syncope) or near fainting   Heart disease symptoms caused by heart defects Serious congenital heart defects — defects you're born with — usually become evident soon after birth. Heart defect symptoms in children could include:   Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis)  Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes  In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain   Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:   Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity  Easily tiring during exercise or activity  Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet   Heart disease symptoms caused by weak heart muscle (dilated cardiomyopathy) In early stages of cardiomyopathy, you may have no symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:   Breathlessness with exertion or at rest  Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet  Fatigue  Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering  Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting   Heart disease symptoms caused by heart infections Endocarditis is an infection that affects the inner membrane that separates the chambers and valves of the heart (endocardium). Heart infection symptoms can include:   Fever  Shortness of breath  Weakness or fatigue  Swelling in your legs or abdomen  Changes in your heart rhythm  Dry or persistent cough  Skin rashes or unusual spots   Heart disease symptoms caused by valvular heart disease The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves — that open and close to direct blood flow through your heart. Valves may be damaged by a variety of conditions leading to narrowing (stenosis), leaking (regurgitation or insufficiency) or improper closing (prolapse).  Depending on which valve isn't working properly, valvular heart disease symptoms generally include:   Fatigue  Shortness of breath  Irregular heartbeat  Swollen feet or ankles  Chest pain  Fainting (syncope)   When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms:   Chest pain  Shortness of breath  Fainting   Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early, so talk to your doctor about your concerns regarding your heart health. If you're concerned about developing heart disease, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease.  If you think you may have heart disease, based on new signs or symptoms you're having, make an appointment to see your doctor.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes How the heart works    Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.     Your heart is a pump. It's a muscular organ about the size of your fist, situated slightly left of center in your chest. Your heart is divided into the right and the left side. The division prevents oxygen-rich blood from mixing with oxygen-poor blood. Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart after circulating through your body.   The right side of the heart, comprising the right atrium and ventricle, collects and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries.  The lungs refresh the blood with a new supply of oxygen. The lungs also breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste product.  Oxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, comprising the left atrium and ventricle.  The left side of the heart pumps blood through the aorta to supply tissues throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients.   Heart valves Four valves within your heart keep your blood moving the right way by opening only one way and only when they need to. To function properly, the valve must be formed properly, must open all the way and must close tightly so there's no leakage. The four valves are:   Tricuspid  Mitral  Pulmonary  Aortic   Heartbeats    The blueprints to your heart  Click here for an infographic to learn more   A beating heart contracts and relaxes in a continuous cycle.   During contraction (systole), your ventricles contract, forcing blood into the vessels to your lungs and body.  During relaxation (diastole), the ventricles are filled with blood coming from the upper chambers (left and right atria).   Electrical system Your heart's electrical wiring keeps it beating, which controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. This exchange keeps you alive.   Electrical impulses begin high in the right atrium and travel through specialized pathways to the ventricles, delivering the signal for the heart to pump.  The conduction system keeps your heart beating in a coordinated and normal rhythm, which keeps blood circulating.   Various heart disease causes The causes of heart disease vary by type of heart disease.  Causes of cardiovascular disease    Development of atherosclerosis Development of atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a process in which blood, fats such as cholesterol and other substances build up on your artery walls. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form. The deposits may narrow — or block — your arteries. These plaques can also rupture, causing a blood clot.     While cardiovascular disease can refer to different heart or blood vessel problems, the term is often used to mean damage to your heart or blood vessels by atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis), a buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries. Plaque buildup thickens and stiffens artery walls, which can inhibit blood flow through your arteries to your organs and tissues.  Atherosclerosis is also the most common cause of cardiovascular disease. It can be caused by correctable problems, such as an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, being overweight and smoking.  Causes of heart arrhythmia Common causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) or conditions that can lead to arrhythmias include:   Heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects)  Coronary artery disease  High blood pressure  Diabetes  Smoking  Excessive use of alcohol or caffeine  Drug abuse  Stress  Some over-the-counter medications, prescription medications, dietary supplements and herbal remedies  Valvular heart disease   In a healthy person with a normal, healthy heart, it's unlikely for a fatal arrhythmia to develop without some outside trigger, such as an electrical shock or the use of illegal drugs. That's primarily because a healthy person's heart is free from any abnormal conditions that cause an arrhythmia, such as an area of scarred tissue.  However, in a heart that's diseased or deformed, the heart's electrical impulses may not properly start or travel through the heart, making arrhythmias more likely to develop.  Causes of congenital heart defects Congenital heart defects usually develop while a baby is in the womb. Heart defects can develop as the heart develops, about a month after conception, changing the flow of blood in the heart. Some medical conditions, medications and genes may play a role in causing heart defects.  Heart defects can also develop in adults. As you age, your heart's structure can change, causing a heart defect.  Causes of cardiomyopathy The cause of cardiomyopathy, a thickening or enlarging of the heart muscle, may depend on the type:   Dilated cardiomyopathy. The cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown. It may be caused by reduced blood flow to the heart (ischemic heart disease) resulting from damage after a heart attack, infections, toxins and certain drugs. It may also be inherited from a parent. It usually enlarges (dilates) the left ventricle.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type, in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, usually is inherited. It can also develop over time because of high blood pressure or aging.  Restrictive cardiomyopathy. This least common type of cardiomyopathy, which causes the heart muscle to become rigid and less elastic, can occur for no known reason. Or it may be caused by diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, excessive iron buildup in your body (hemochromatosis), the buildup of abnormal proteins (amyloidosis) or by some cancer treatments.   Causes of heart infection A heart infection, such as endocarditis, is caused when an irritant, such as a bacterium, virus or chemical, reaches your heart muscle. The most common causes of heart infection include:   Bacteria  Viruses  Parasites   Causes of valvular heart disease There are many causes of diseases of your heart valves. You may be born with valvular disease, or the valves may be damaged by conditions such as:   Rheumatic fever  Infections (infectious endocarditis)  Connective tissue disorders   Risk factors Risk factors for developing heart disease include:   Age. Aging increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and weakened or thickened heart muscle.  Sex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. However, women's risk increases after menopause.  Family history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).  Smoking. Nicotine constricts your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers.  Certain chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy for cancer. Some chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapies may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Poor diet. A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.  High blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows.  High blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis.  Diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.  Obesity. Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors.  Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors, as well.  Stress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.  Poor hygiene. Not regularly washing your hands and not establishing other habits that can help prevent viral or bacterial infections can put you at risk of heart infections, especially if you already have an underlying heart condition. Poor dental health also may contribute to heart disease.   Complications Complications of heart disease include:   Heart failure. One of the most common complications of heart disease, heart failure occurs when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure can result from many forms of heart disease, including heart defects, cardiovascular disease, valvular heart disease, heart infections or cardiomyopathy.  Heart attack. A blood clot blocking the blood flow through a blood vessel that feeds the heart causes a heart attack, possibly damaging or destroying a part of the heart muscle. Atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack.  Stroke. The risk factors that lead to cardiovascular disease also can lead to an ischemic stroke, which happens when the arteries to your brain are narrowed or blocked so that too little blood reaches your brain. A stroke is a medical emergency — brain tissue begins to die within just a few minutes of a stroke.  Aneurysm. A serious complication that can occur anywhere in your body, an aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of your artery. If an aneurysm bursts, you may face life-threatening internal bleeding.  Peripheral artery disease. Atherosclerosis also can lead to peripheral artery disease. When you develop peripheral artery disease, your extremities — usually your legs — don't receive enough blood flow. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking (claudication).  Sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness, often caused by an arrhythmia. Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, it is fatal, resulting in sudden cardiac death.   Prevention Certain types of heart disease, such as heart defects, can't be prevented. However, you can help prevent many other types of heart disease by making the same lifestyle changes that can improve your heart disease, such as:   Quit smoking  Control other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes  Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week  Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat  Maintain a healthy weight  Reduce and manage stress  Practice good hygiene   By Mayo Clinic Staff    Heart disease care at Mayo Clinic   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Diagnosis & treatment  March 22, 2018    Share on: Facebook Twitter    References  What is cardiovascular disease?

Several online calculators have been developed to help estimate your odds.    The most commonly used heart attack calculator was developed by the Framingham Heart Study. A good one is the risk assessment tool made available by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute .    The newer Reynolds Risk Score , one for men and one for women, includes the Framingham variables plus family history and level of C-reactive protein.    The most comprehensive is the heart disease section of Your Disease Risk , originated at the Harvard School of Public Health and now hosted by Washington University School of Medicine.

  having a heart attack or stroke promises a 'wake-up call' to shock Britons 
  into changing lifestyles            A man holds his chest as he suffers from a heart attack (posed by model)  Photo: Alamy                  By Laura Donnelly , Health Editor   10:00PM GMT 08 Mar 2015   Follow        The NHS has launched a controversial calculator which predicts when you will have a heart attack or stroke - and compares a person’s “heart age” with their biological age. Health experts said the online tool would give individuals “a wake-up call” - pushing those at risk of heart disease into making lifestyle changes to protect themselves from the UK’s biggest killer. But some critics raised concerns about the accuracy of a “blunt tool” which tells every Briton they will have a heart attack or stroke one day, when many will not, and raised fears that the tool could be used to push millions more people into taking medication. They also expressed concern that individuals would be frightened by being given a prediction, much of which is based on factors beyond their control, such as their family history of disease. Last month a study found that some of the most widely-used risk calculators in use in the United States were exaggerating the risks of heart disease, by more than double. GPs will be asked to promote the new NHS calculator, in a bid to encourage patients to take steps to improve their health - such as losing weight, or giving up smoking – or to start taking medication to lower cholesterol and statins. The tool, which has launched online, asks individuals to provide basic facts – such as age height, weight, smoking – plus some details of their medical history, and whether relatives have suffered from heart disease before the age of 60.  Click here to take the test on a mobile   Experts behind the tool say it is most accurate if individuals can also provide readings of cholesterol and blood pressure levels. The calculator then provides an estimate of a person’s “heart age” – and most controversially, predicts when they will suffer a heart attack or stroke. It also provides the percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke within a decade. It means a woman of 41, with an unhealthy lifestyle, medical problems such as diabetes, and a family history of heart disease could be warned that she is likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke around the age of 51. Another woman the same age, with a different lifestyle and family history could be told she is likely to get to the age of 83 before being consigned to such a fate. A man of 50 who smokes, suffers a number of medical problems and a family history of heart disease, could be he told he is likely to have a heart attack or stroke at 56. A healthier man of the same age, with a different family history could expect to live to 79 without a heart attack or stroke, according to the calculator, which provides estimates to anyone over the age of 30. The calculator is a collaboration between NHS Choices, Public Health England and the British Heart Foundation (BHF). Professor John Deanfield, an NHS cardiologist who helped develop the tool, said: “Understanding your heart age can be a real wake up call for people who might be at risk. It can be that all important nudge to take action and make lifestyle changes to improve your heart health.” Dr Aseem Malhotra, Honorary consultant cardiologist, at Frimley Park Hospital, was far more cautious. He said: “It is important to help identify those at risk of heart disease, but I really hope this has been properly evaluated; we don’t want to make the same mistakes we have seen in the US, where calculators enormously exaggerated the risks.” He also raised concerns about whether the information would be used to scare millions more people into taking statins, amid heated arguments about the benefits and risks of the drugs. Last July, health watchdogs recommended that statins should be offered to around 17 million people – anyone estimated to have a 10 per cent chance of developing heart disease within a decade.   The tool provides the percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke within a decade (Getty)  Some doctors criticised the plans, fearing that the “mass medicalisation” of the public would put too many at risk of side-effects. Dr Malhotra said he was concerned that the new NHS tool does not take account of basic lifestyle factors – such as the type of diet people ate, and how much exercise they took. “It is a pretty crude evaluation to only use weight as a proxy for lifestyle,” he said. Coronary heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the UK and in 2013, more than 18,000 people died prematurely this way. Most deaths from coronary heart disease are caused by heart attacks with an average of 90,000 attacks in England per year. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: “Too many people are dying prematurely from preventable conditions and there is clear evidence that factors like smoking and high blood pressure play a major role in this.” He said the heart age tool helped people to see the “direct impact” that lifestyle changes could make on their heart’s health. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Knowing your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease is crucial to taking control of your health. Armed with this knowledge you can start to make lifestyle changes to help protect yourself against heart attacks and strokes.” The NHS is also developing a similar system of dementia screening , which aims to give middle-aged people their “brain age” and an estimate of how likely they are to develop conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.        telegraph.co.uk     Follow @telegraph                          Top news galleries       Woody Allen's 30 best one-liners          Comedy    Martin Chilton selects 30 great one-liners from the comedian and film

Save Everyday Health   Heart Health   Heart Health  The Single Best Predictor of a Heart Attack Previous Next   Each year close to 1.4 million Americans experience a heart attack , and more than 500,000 die from it. Strikingly, according to the Society for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, 50 to 70 percent of those who suffered fatal heart attacks were not even aware of their risk. Despite recent scientific advances in heart disease prevention, many high-risk patients are overlooked when conventional risk assessment methods such as cholesterol and blood pressure screenings are used alone. Here’s what you need to know about the No. 1 predictor of a heart attack, the calcium score, plus eight other risk factors to consider.   The Calcium Score A calcium score , obtained from a noninvasive computed tomography (CT) scan of your heart, is the measure of the amount of calcium in your coronary arteries. This number reflects the total amount of atherosclerotic plaque. It’s an indication of how all of your risk factors interact with each other to cause heart disease. The higher your calcium score for your age, the greater your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Many preventive cardiologists are recommending that asymptomatic men over age 40 and most postmenopausal women over age 50 have a heart scan to determine their calcium score, unless they have been determined by a doctor to be at very low risk. A calcium score of zero means you have no calcium deposits and a low risk of heart attack in the next five years. A score of 400 or more puts you at high risk of a heart attack within 10 years; a score of 1,000-plus means you have up to a 25 percent chance of having a heart attack within a year without medical treatment. The significance of a given score also depends on your age. For instance, if you’re 40 and have a score of 50, it indicates you are at high risk. If an 80-year-old has a score of 50, it indicates low risk because the atherosclerotic process has proceeded very slowly. If your score is high for your age, then your doctor may advise adopting a heart-healthy diet, such as the South Beach Diet, along with other lifestyle changes, and often medications, to improve your risk profile. It may be a statin to lower cholesterol and/or a medication to lower your blood pressure. You can get a CT scan for coronary calcium at most major medical centers, with the cost ranging from $99 to $399. The test takes about 10 minutes and radiation is minimal, about the same as a mammogram. Check with your insurance carrier to see if this test is covered.   Family History of Heart Disease If one or both of your parents died prematurely of a heart attack, it puts you at greater risk. Still, there are other factors to consider when it comes to family history . If your father smoked, rarely exercised, and ate a diet high in bad carbs and bad fats, his death could have been hastened by any or all of those factors. You may have been dealt a bad set of genes, but there’s a great deal you can do when it comes to lifestyle to reduce and even eliminate the familial risk. Often, medications are also needed to overcome the effect of bad genes. While, many people know the cardiovascular health of their parents influences their level of risk, they are unaware that the health of their siblings matters, too. If you have a brother or sister with cardiovascular disease, your own risk is increased by as much as 100 percent. In fact, if you grew up in the same household as your sibling, your sibling’s medical history is likely to be even more informative than your parents’. You and your brothers and sisters not only have similar genes, but you also ate similar food and grew up in the same environment.   Smoking and Heart Disease Risk At any age, smoking at least doubles your risk of heart disease. In fact, smoking can trigger a heart attack even if your arteries are nearly perfect. Once you light up, smoking narrows your arteries, raises your blood pressure, increases your risk of irregular heartbeat, and makes your blood sticky and more likely to clot. Smoking also lowers your HDL (“good”) cholesterol and increases arterial inflammation. This is the perfect recipe for a heart attack. If you smoke, and particularly if you have other risk factors for heart disease, each time you light a cigarette, you’re playing Russian roulette with your heart. A smoker who has high blood pressure and high LDL (“bad”) cholesterol has 14 times the normal risk of having cardiovascular disease. A woman who takes birth control pills (which increase the risk of blood clots) and who also smokes has a much greater risk of heart disease than does a woman who takes birth control pills but does not smoke. In young people with heart attacks, smoking is often the biggest culprit.   Diagnosis of Diabetes or Prediabetes If you are an American age 40 to 70, the odds are about 40 percent that you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes (also known as metabolic syndrome and typically characterized by increased waist circumference, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low good HDL cholesterol, and a mildly elevated blood sugar). Diabetes is such a strong risk factor for heart disease that medical professionals define it as a “coronary heart disease risk equivalent.” This means that a person with diabetes has the same high risk of a heart attack as someone who has already had one. Up to 70 percent of people in coronary care units have prediabetes or diabetes. Women, take note: If you have diabetes and have suffered a heart attack, you have an even greater risk of having another heart attack or heart failure than a man who has diabetes and has suffered a heart attack.   Waist Circumference and Your Heart The circumference of your waist is an indicator of your odds of having a heart attack or stroke. If you have an apple-shaped body and carry much of your weight around your middle, you are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease than if you have a pear-shaped body and store fat mainly in your buttocks and thighs, or evenly over your entire body. Studies have found that waist circumference is an excellent predictor of who will develop diabetes and heart disease. A waist circumference of more than 35 inches if you’re a women (and 40 inches if you’re a man) puts you at risk. Get rid of that extra belly fat through diet and exercise.   High Blood Pressure About one in three American adults has high blood pressure , also called hypertension. High blood pressure is currently defined as a reading of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, but guidelines regarding what constitutes “high” versus “normal” keep changing. Right now, blood pressure anywhere between 120/80 (normal) and 139/89 are labeled prehypertension. The American Heart Association estimates that 65 million Americans are in this category. It also estimates that people with prehypertension may be three times as likely to have a heart attack as those with normal blood pressure. Although blood pressure can vary from minute to minute with exercise, stress, sleep, and even changes in posture when at rest and relaxed, it should normally be less than 120/80 mm Hg for both men and women age 20 and older.   Cholesterol and Your Heart Total cholesterol, when considered alone, is a poor predictor of heart disease and heart attack. Studies show that total cholesterol levels among people who’ve had heart attacks are almost the same as those of people who haven’t, and that roughly half of heart attacks occur in people without high cholesterol . If you have other risk factors for heart disease, particularly a family history, having your HDL and LDL particle size measured with an advanced blood test will give you a far clearer picture of your heart risk than the conventional lipid panel. Having a lot of large particles cuts your risk for a heart attack, while having a lot of small ones raises it. You do not want more than 15 percent of your particles to be the small, dense type.   Triglycerides and Your Heart Triglycerides are the form in which fat is stored in your body’s fat cells. Your triglyceride level is almost always strongly influenced by lifestyle. If you have high triglycerides (over 150 mg/dL is borderline high) and low HDL (less than 40 mg/dL if you’re a man and less than 50 mg/dL if you’re a woman), your risk of heart disease is compounded. To find out if you have this added risk, divide your triglyceride count by your HDL count. Ideally, the resulting number will be 2 or lower. For example, if your triglyceride level is 200 and your HDL is 40, divide 200 by 40 and you get 5. This is much higher than the desirable ratio, and it tells you that you have a heightened risk of a heart attack that will need to be addressed. Your triglyceride level can also offer insight into your LDL particle size. In general, the higher your triglycerides and the lower your HDL, the smaller and denser your LDL and the greater your risk of heart disease. If your triglycerides are higher than 200 and your HDL is lower than 45, it is likely that you have too many small, dense LDL particles.   A Sedentary Lifestyle and Your Heart A life with little to no physical activity leads to a number of undesirable body changes. Your blood pressure goes up, your triglycerides increase, your level of good HDL falls (this is why triglycerides and HDL are often called the “lifestyle” numbers), and you are more likely to gain weight, especially around your midsection. This is a picture of a heart attack in the making. No wonder the AARP recently called sitting the new smoking. The sad news is that two-thirds of American adults report that they are physically inactive — that is, they are sedentary most of the time. It’s time to get up and get moving .   What You Can Do to Improve Your Heart Disease Risk Factors Beyond understanding your risk factors, getting the correct tests, and taking medications as prescribed, the most important step you can take to minimize your risk of heart attack and sudden death is to engage in a healthy lifestyle. That means shedding any extra pounds by adopting a heart-healthy diet, like the South Beach Diet, that focuses on nutrient-dense, fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in addition to good fats and lean protein. It means making time for at least 20 minutes of aerobic or core-strengthening exercise most days of the week . And it means getting plenty of restorative sleep. Not only will these three steps help you lose weight and keep it off (yes, lack of sleep promotes weight gain), they will also help lower your blood pressure, improve insulin resistance in those with prediabetes and diabetes, and counter most of the other risk factors you’ve just read about. It’s an encouraging fact: The earlier you start making these healthy lifestyle changes, the better your chances of avoiding a heart attack down the road.
