August 25, 2016 / 21 Comments / in Being Left Handed  / by Neal What percentage of people are left handed? Ever signed for a delivery and had the driver ask if you’re a lefty? Apparently we’re still that much of a rarity that people feel the need to point it out to us every time they notice. I’m not having a go, I do it myself. All the time… Last week at work the purchasing team ordered a bunch of Fender merchandise, including ( for some reason! ) this ridiculous anime lunchbox . Rather than asking why in the hell we were stocking a Fender lunchbox (like everyone else in the office), I proudly pointed out that the girl on the front was playing a left handed guitar. So apparently it’s still a novelty even to me . A guy who is left handed, plays guitar lefty, and runs a lefty guitar website … What makes for the fascination? Just how many people are left handed exactly ? Check out the handy, dandy infographic below (click to enlarge!), or keep reading to find out. What Percentage of People are Left Handed? Roughly 12% of the world is left handed. This figure is averaged from studies undertaken in North America and Western Europe. In these developed countries being left handed is less likely to be discouraged due to social stigmas, which should result in a less skewed overall number. Although it should be noted that left handed discrimination does still occur in these countries, such as this well publicised example in the USA in 2015. Right Handed (~87%) . I’m sure you didn’t come to this article unaware that right handed people make up the majority of the population. It is estimated that right handed people amount to roughly 87% of the world. Left Handed (~12%) . The second most common handedness type, studies show that on average us lefties make up around 12% of the population. Although this does vary depending on location, as in some countries being left handed may still have a social stigma attached to it. For example Taiwan (5%), Japan (4.7%), and Korea (2%) all have a much lower population of lefties. Scroll down a little further to see the lefty representation broken down by country. Ambidextrous (<1%) . An ambidextrous person is able to perform any task equally well with either hand, although they do still tend to favor their dominant side. Truly ambidextrous people are incredibly rare, and are estimated to make up less than 1% of the population. Ambivelous (<1%) . An ambivelous (or ambisinister) person is the exact opposite of an ambidextrous person, finding it generally awkward to use either hand to undertake tasks. Age is a Factor Even until recently, being left handed was still discouraged in many developed countries. We can see this when we look at the number of lefties in different age groups in North America. Only 6% of over-65s identified as being left handed, whereas a whopping 15% of under 30s said the same. Check out the graph below which shows the percentage of lefties broken down by year. These results were taken from a large study by Gilbert and Wysocki ( Hand Preference and Age in the United States , 1992) which included over 1 million people. The increased number of people identifying as being left handed is almost certainly due to modern society becoming less conservative. On top of this, it is estimated that amongst older generations some 6-8% of right handed people are actually natural left handers , but were forced into writing right handed due to social pressures. Considering the results based on age, it would seem very likely that the overall percentage of people identifying as being a lefty will continue to increase over time. How Many People Are Left Handed In Other Parts of the World? The figures above are taken from a select few countries, but what about the rest of the world? Check out the graphic below to find out! Data for European countries was taken from a large internet study by McManus and Peters ( Handedness in Europe: analysis of data from the BBC internet study ). Information on other countries was sourced from various other bodies of research. It’s clear that in countries with a more formal culture, the rate of left-handedness is much lower. It has been suggested that the more complex writing style in many Asian countries is a major reason why the numbers are so much lower. Men Versus Women Lefties are not created equally! According to a 2008 study ( Sex Differences in Left-Handedness: A Meta-Analysis of 144 Studies ), a left handed person is 23% more likely to be male than female . This means that for every 4 left handed women, there should be roughly 5 left handed men. One possible explanation for this uneven split is that girls are more likely to conform to social norms. It has also been suggested that there may be genetic factors, which you can read about below. The Chances of Having a Left Handed Child According to a 2009 study by Llaurens, Raymond and Faurie ( Why are some people left-handed? An evolutionary perspective ), the chances of having a left handed child are as follows: Both parents Left Handed – 27% Male / 21.4% Female Righty Father & Lefty Mother – 22.1% Male / 21.7% Female Lefty Father & Righty Mother – 18.2% Male / 15.3% Female Both Parents Right Handed – 10.4% Male / 8.5% Female I’ve averaged these results out for simplicity and displayed them in the graphic below. Another interesting factoid I stumbled across was that two left handed parents are twice as likely to produce twins! Is There A Place Where 100% of People Are Lefties? Yes!

Left-handers are the odd men out.  Sure, lefties make up about 10 percent of the population -- but, frankly, it seems like society has forgotten about them. Right-handed gadgets, awkwardly designed desks, cooking tools that fit comfortably in your right hand (now that’s just wrong!).  More From Everyday Health:  10 Tips To Improve Your Memory  Unraveling The Meaning Of Dreams  8 Fascinating Pain Facts You Didn't Know  What causes someone to become a southpaw? Scientists aren’t exactly sure, but research points to a complex collaboration between genes and environment. While no exact set of “leftie genes” have been discovered, people who dominantly use their left hands do have more left-handed family members. And researchers have found different brain wirings in righties vs. lefties.  But no matter what it is that drives someone to use their antipodal paw, science has also uncovered a particular set of personality traits that left-handed people tend to have. So for all of you lefties, leftie-loving righties and ambidextrous folks out there -- it’s time to brush up on your left-handed knowledge and help put an end to leftie discrimination once and for all.      PHOTO GALLERY  11 Facts About Left-Handers      Left-handers are the minority -- so does that mean they’ll go extinct one day? Nah! In fact, some researchers believe that when it comes to survival of the fittest, lefties come out on top.  Here’s why: In man-on-man combat, using the left-hand is like throwing a curveball. "The fact that left-handers are less common means they have a surprise effect," University of Montpellier researcher Charlotte Faurie told ABC News. To dig deeper, Faurie and her colleague Michel Raymond studied nine different primitive societies. In more violent societies, they found that lefties thrived (think southpaw slugger Rocky Balboa’s left hook).  Looks like the left hand has the upper hand after all.

Lefties Hear Speeches Differently  People who are using their left hands when listening may more easily hear rapidly changing sounds than those who are using their right hands, according to a study from Georgetown University Medical Center. The researchers who conducted the study, presented at Neuroscience 2012, found that the left and right hemispheres of the brain specialize in different kinds of sounds -- the left hemisphere, which controls the right hand, likes rapidly changing sounds like consonants, while the right hemisphere, which controls the left hand, likes slowly changing sounds, like syllables or intonation. According to the researchers, if you're waving an American flag while listening to a presidential candidate, the speech will sound slightly different to you depending on whether you're holding the flag in your left or right hand. The research could ultimately result in better treatment for stroke and language disorders.

She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

(January 2013)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     See also: Southpaw stance  Interactive sports such as table tennis, badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness, while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation. Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.  “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.  “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

(January 2013)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     See also: Southpaw stance  Interactive sports such as table tennis, badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness, while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation. Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

For example, a cross-dominant person might write with the left hand but throw mainly with the right one. [1]  It can also refer to mixed laterality , which refers to a person favoring eyes, ears, feet, or hands on one side of the body. A person who is cross-dominant can also be stronger on the opposite side of the body that they favor; for example, a right-handed person can be stronger on the left side. Cross-dominance can often be a problem when shooting or in activities that require aim, although athletes can still achieve success in sports that require accuracy, like passing in American football and shooting in basketball. [ citation needed ]   Overall, being mixed handed seems to result in better performance than being strongly handed for sports such as basketball, ice hockey, and field hockey. What these sports have in common is that they require active body movements and also an ability to respond to either side. The situation is reversed for racquet sports such as tennis. Individuals with crossed hand-eye preference seem to be much better at gymnastics, running, and basketball because of the way in which congruent and crossed sided individuals position their bodies.  — Stanley Coren , The Left-Hander Syndrome , Chapter 3      Contents    1  In baseball  2  In tennis  3  In snooker  4  References  5  External links     In baseball [ edit ]  In baseball a left-handed batter is about two steps closer to first base than a right-handed batter, one important advantage. [2] Because curveballs and sliders – the most commonly used breaking pitches in the game – curve in the direction of a pitcher 's non-throwing hand, a batter who bats opposite the pitcher's throwing hand enjoys an advantage. Since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters enjoy a second advantage over their right-handed counterparts. [2] However, right-handed throwing is more valuable in the field. Every fielding position can be played by a right-handed thrower, although left-handers are considered more valuable pitchers and have a slight advantage at first base owing to the fact that they do not have to turn around to place their foot on first when stretching to catch a throw. Conversely, left-handed throwers are almost completely absent at the highest level at the other infield positions and at catcher . [3]  Switch hitting exists so a batter can hit from the side opposite every pitcher's throwing arm, but it has gained some criticism because a batter will always be more dominant from one side of the plate than the other; the switch hitter may be less reliable from one side. So, many baseball players are trained to be simply cross-dominant, batting solely left-handed and throwing solely right-handed. [4] There are a few position players, such as Rickey Henderson and Cleon Jones , who bat right and throw left; but this serves as a substantial disadvantage. Rickey Henderson only did that because he was taught to bat right-handed by right-handed teammates. [5]  In tennis [ edit ]  Rafael Nadal is right-hand dominant but plays tennis primarily with his left hand and a two-handed backhand, which he attributes to initially playing all shots with both hands until told he would have to choose a side for his forehand shots.  In snooker [ edit ]  In snooker , swapping the cue from one hand to the other in order to gain easy access to an oblique shot was long thought to be disrespectful, though more recently it has come to be accepted, especially since Ronnie O'Sullivan has dominated the world game and often escaped from snookers by switching to a left-handed action. [6] [ not in citation given ] There are also several players, most notably Barry Hawkins , who play with the opposite hand of their dominant one.

For specialization of brain function generally, see Functional specialization (brain) .     The human brain is divided into two hemispheres–left and right. Scientists continue to explore how some cognitive functions tend to be dominated by one side or the other; that is, how they are lateralized .    The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one hemisphere rather than the other. The medial longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres , connected by the corpus callosum . Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere. [ medical citation needed ]  Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human’s brain develops differently leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend since it has a stronger anthropological history. [1] The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. These areas frequently correspond to handedness, however, meaning that the localization of these areas is regularly found on the hemisphere corresponding to the dominant hand (anatomically on the opposite side). Function lateralization such as semantics , intonation , accentuation , prosody , etc. has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres. [2] Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum this is the same bodyside, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side .

(October 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Broca [ edit ]  One of the first indications of brain function lateralization resulted from the research of French physician Pierre Paul Broca , in 1861. His research involved the male patient nicknamed "Tan", who suffered a speech deficit ( aphasia ); "tan" was one of the few words he could articulate, hence his nickname. In Tan's autopsy , Broca determined he had a syphilitic lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere. This left frontal lobe brain area ( Broca's area ) is an important speech production region. The motor aspects of speech production deficits caused by damage to Broca’s area are known as expressive aphasia . In clinical assessment of this aphasia, it is noted that the patient cannot clearly articulate the language being employed.  Wernicke [ edit ]  German physician Karl Wernicke continued in the vein of Broca's research by studying language deficits unlike expressive aphasia. Wernicke noted that not every deficit was in speech production; some were linguistic. He found that damage to the left posterior , superior temporal  gyrus ( Wernicke's area ) caused language comprehension deficits rather than speech production deficits, a syndrome known as receptive aphasia .  Advance in imaging technique [ edit ]  These seminal works on hemispheric specialization were done on patients or postmortem brains, raising questions about the potential impact of pathology on the research findings. New methods permit the in vivo comparison of the hemispheres in healthy subjects. Particularly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are important because of their high spatial resolution and ability to image subcortical brain structures.  Movement and sensation [ edit ]  In the 1940s, neurosurgeon  Wilder Penfield and his neurologist colleague Herbert Jasper developed a technique of brain mapping to help reduce side effects caused by surgery to treat epilepsy . They stimulated motor and somatosensory cortices of the brain with small electrical currents to activate discrete brain regions. They found that stimulation of one hemisphere's motor cortex produces muscle contraction on the opposite side of the body. Furthermore, the functional map of the motor and sensory cortices is fairly consistent from person to person; Penfield and Jasper's famous pictures of the motor and sensory homunculi were the result.  Split-brain patients [ edit ]  Main article: Split-brain  Research by Michael Gazzaniga and Roger Wolcott Sperry in the 1960s on split-brain patients led to an even greater understanding of functional laterality. Split-brain patients are patients who have undergone corpus callosotomy (usually as a treatment for severe epilepsy), a severing of a large part of the corpus callosum . The corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres of the brain and allows them to communicate. When these connections are cut, the two halves of the brain have a reduced capacity to communicate with each other. This led to many interesting behavioral phenomena that allowed Gazzaniga and Sperry to study the contributions of each hemisphere to various cognitive and perceptual processes. One of their main findings was that the right hemisphere was capable of rudimentary language processing, but often has no lexical or grammatical abilities. [3] Eran Zaidel also studied such patients and found some evidence for the right hemisphere having at least some syntactic ability.  Language is primarily localized in the left hemisphere. One of the experiments carried out by Gazzaniga involved a split-brain male patient sitting in front of a computer screen while having words and images presented on either side of the screen and the visual stimuli would go to either the right or left visual field, and thus the left or right brain, respectively. It was observed that if the patient was presented with an image to his left visual field (right brain), he would report not seeing anything. If he was able to feel around for certain objects, he could accurately pick out the correct object, despite not having the ability to verbalize what he saw. This led to confirmation that the left brain is localized for language whereas the right brain does not have this capability, and when the corpus callosum is cut, the two hemispheres cannot communicate in order for situation-pertinent speech to be produced.  Pop psychology [ edit ]     The oversimplification of lateralization in pop psychology. This belief was widely held even in the scientific community for some years.    Some popularizations oversimplify the science about lateralization, by presenting the functional differences between hemispheres as being more absolute than is actually the case. [4] : 107 [5]  Sex differences [ edit ]  See also: Neuroscience of sex differences  In the 19th century and to a lesser extent the 20th, it was thought that each side of the brain was associated with a specific gender: the left corresponding with masculinity and the right with femininity and each half could function independently. [6] The right side of the brain was seen as the inferior and thought to be prominent in women, savages, children, criminals, and the insane. A prime example of this in fictional literature can be seen in Robert Louis Stevenson ’s Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . [7]  Lateralized cognitive processes [ edit ]  For example, structurally, the lateral sulcus generally is longer in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere, and functionally, Broca's area and Wernicke's area are located in the left cerebral hemisphere for about 95% of right-handers, but about 70% of left-handers. [8] : 69  Language functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in right handed individuals. [9] While language production is left-lateralized in up to 90% of right-handed subjects, it is more bilateral, or even right lateralized in approximately 50% of left-handers. [10] In contrast, prosodic language functions, such as intonation and accentuation , often are lateralized to the right hemisphere of the brain. [ medical citation needed ]  The processing of visual and auditory stimuli, spatial manipulation, facial perception , and artistic ability are represented bilaterally. [10] Numerical estimation, comparison and online calculation depend on bilateral parietal regions [11] [12] while exact calculation and fact retrieval are associated with left parietal regions, perhaps due to their ties to linguistic processing. [11] [12]  Depression is linked with a hyperactive right hemisphere, with evidence of selective involvement in "processing negative emotions, pessimistic thoughts and unconstructive thinking styles", as well as vigilance, arousal and self-reflection, and a relatively hypoactive left hemisphere, "specifically involved in processing pleasurable experiences" and "relatively more involved in decision-making processes". [13] Additionally, "left hemisphere lesions result in an omissive response bias or error pattern whereas right hemisphere lesions result in a commissive response bias or error pattern." [14] The delusional misidentification syndromes , reduplicative paramnesia and Capgras delusion are also often the result of right hemisphere lesions. [15]  Handedness and language [ edit ]  Broca's area and Wernicke's area are linked by a white matter fiber tract, the arcuate fasciculus . This axonal tract allows the neurons in the two areas to work together in creating vocal language. In more than 95% of right-handed men, and more than 90% of right-handed women, the left hemisphere is dominant in certain aspects of language and speech processing. Left-handed people may be less lateralized than right-handed people in language function. [ medical citation needed ]  Pathology [ edit ]  Hemisphere damage [ edit ]  Damage to either the right or left hemisphere, and its resulting deficits provide insight into the function of the damaged area. Right hemisphere damage has many effects on language production and perception. Damage or lesions to the right hemisphere can result in a lack of emotional prosody or intonation when speaking. Right hemisphere damage also has monumental effects on understanding discourse. People with damage to the right hemisphere have a reduced ability to generate inferences, comprehend and produce main concepts and a reduced ability to manage alternative meanings. Furthermore, when engaging in discourse people with right hemisphere damage, their discourse is often abrupt and perfunctory or verbose and excessive. They can also have pragmatic deficits in situations of turn taking, topic maintenance and shared knowledge. [ medical citation needed ]  Lateral brain damage can also have effects on spatial frequency. People with left hemisphere damage are only able to see low frequency, or big picture, parts of an image. Right hemisphere damage causes damage to low spatial frequency, so people with right hemisphere damage can only see the details of an image, or the high frequency parts of an image. [ medical citation needed ]  Plasticity [ edit ]  If a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the same hemisphere or the corresponding region in the other hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age. [16] When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies.  Broca's aphasia [ edit ]  Broca’s aphasia is a specific type of expressive aphasia and is so named due to the aphasia that results from damage or lesions to the Broca’s area of the brain, that exists most commonly in the left inferior frontal hemisphere. Thus, the aphasia that develops from the lack of functioning of the Broca’s area is an expressive and non-fluent aphasia. It is called ‘non-fluent’ due the issues that arise because Broca’s area is critical for language pronunciation and production. The area controls some motor aspects of speech production and articulation of thoughts to words and as such lesions to the area result in the specific non-fluent aphasia. [17]  Wernicke's aphasia [ edit ]  Wernicke’s aphasia is the result of damage to the area of the brain that is commonly in the left hemisphere above the sylvian fissure. Damage to this area causes primarily a deficit in language comprehension. While the ability to speak fluently with normal melodic intonation is spared, the language produced by a person with Wernicke’s aphasia is riddled with semantic errors, and may sound nonsensical to the listener. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by phonemic paraphasias, neologism or jargon. Another characteristic of a person with Wernicke’s aphasia is that they are unconcerned by the mistakes that they are making. [ medical citation needed ]  Misapplication of concept [ edit ]  Terence Hines states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research. [18] For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as EMDR and neurolinguistic programming , [19] brain-training equipment, or management training. [20]  Advantages of brain lateralization [ edit ]  The widespread lateralization of many vertebrate animals indicates an evolutionary advantage associated with the specialization of each hemisphere.

Part of this is due to design in the world which is often right-hand biased. Handwriting is one of the biggest sources of actual disadvantage for left-handed people, other than for those forced to work with certain machinery. Approximately ten percent of the world's population is left-handed, [1] yet many common articles are designed for efficient use by right-handed people, and may be inconvenient, painful, or even dangerous for left-handed people to use. These may include school desks, kitchen implements, and tools ranging from simple scissors to hazardous machinery such as power saws . [2]  Beyond being inherently disadvantaged by a right-handed bias in the design of tools, left-handed people have been subjected to deliberate discrimination and discouragement. In certain societies, they may be considered unlucky or even malicious by the right-handed majority. Many languages still contain references to left-handedness to convey awkwardness, dishonesty, stupidity, or other undesirable qualities. Even in relatively advanced societies, left-handed people were historically (and in some cases still are) forced as children to use their right hands for tasks which they would naturally perform with the left, such as eating.

Peoples of the Andes consider left-handers to possess special spiritual abilities, including magic and healing .  The Third Sapa Inca — Lloque Yupanqui —was left-handed. His name, when translated from Quechua , means "the glorified lefthander."  In the Chinese language, the character for "left", 左 , depicts a left hand attending to its work. In contrast, the character for "right", 右 ( yòu ), depicts a right hand in relation to the mouth, suggesting the act of eating.  In tantra Buddhism , the left hand represents wisdom. [4]  In early Roman times, the left side retained a positive connotation, as the Augures proceeded from the eastern side. [5] The negative meaning was subsequently borrowed into Latin from Greek, and ever since in all Roman languages.  In Russian, "levsha" (lefty, lefthander) became a common noun for skilled craftsman, after the title character from " The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea " written in 1881 by Nikolai Leskov .  Unfavorable perceptions [ edit ]  The unfavorable associations and connotations of the use of the left hand among cultures are varied. In some areas, in order to preserve cleanliness where sanitation was an issue, the right hand, as the dominant hand of most individuals, was used for eating, handling food, and social interactions. The left hand would then be used for personal hygiene, specifically after urination and defecation. These rules were imposed on all, no matter their dominant hand. Through these practices, the left hand became known as the "unclean" hand. [6] Currently, amongst Muslims and in some societies including Nepal and India it is still customary to use the left hand for cleaning oneself with water after defecating. The right hand is commonly known in contradistinction from the left, as the hand used for eating. [7] In the film Lawrence of Arabia there is no insult taken when the guide offers his food to Lawrence and he takes it to his mouth with his left hand. [8]  In many religions, including Christianity, the right hand of God is the favored hand. For example, Jesus sits at God's right side. God's left hand, however, is the hand of judgement . The Archangel Gabriel is sometimes called "God's left hand", sits at God's left side, and is one of six angels of death . Those who fall from favor with God are sent to left, as described in Matthew 25: 32–33, in which sheep represent the righteous and goats represent the fallen: "And he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on his right, but the goats on his left." In 19th-century Europe, homosexuals were referred to as "left-handed". [9] In Protestant-majority parts of the United Kingdom, Catholics were called "left-footers", and vice versa in Catholic-majority parts of Ireland and Irish America . [10]  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ", which is strongly associated with Satanism . [ citation needed ]  Various innocuous activities and experiences become rude or even signs of bad luck when the left hand becomes involved. In some parts of Scotland , it is considered bad luck to meet a left-handed person at the start of a journey. [11] In Ghana , pointing, gesturing, giving or receiving items with the left hand is considered taboo or rude. A person giving directions will put their left hand behind them and even physically strain to point with their right hand if necessary. [12] In some Asian countries, holding eating utensils in the left hand is considered impolite. [13]  Further information: Etiquette in Asia  Forced use of the right hand [ edit ]  Due to cultural and social pressures, many left-handed children were encouraged or forced to write and perform other activities with their right hands. This conversion can cause multiple problems in the developing left-handed child, including learning disorders , dyslexia , [14]  stuttering [15] [16] [17] and other speech disorders . [18] Shifts from left- to right-handed are more likely to be successful than right to left, though neither have a high success rate to begin with. Successful shifters are more likely to become ambihanded than unsuccessful ones. [19] Conversions can be successful with consistent daily practice in a variety of manual activities, but though activity in the non-dominant left-hemisphere of the brain will increase during tasks, so too will activity in the dominant right-hemisphere. Consistent left-handers have no higher activity in these task centers than converted left-handers, so it may be inferred that "attempts to switch handedness by educational training far from weakening the functional expression of lefthandedness in higher-order motor areas of the (dominant) right hemisphere in fact enhance it." [20]  Many Asian countries encourage or force their children to become right-handed due to cultural perceptions of bad luck associated with the left hand. In India and Indonesia, it is considered rude to eat with the left hand. [13] In a 2007 study in Taiwan , 59.3% of children studied had been forced to convert from left-handedness to right-handedness. The study took into account economic status of the children's families and found that children whose parents had less education were more likely to be forced to convert. Even among children whose parents had higher levels of education, the conversion rate was 45.7%. [21] Among naturally left-handed Japanese senior high school students, only 0.7% and 1.7% of individuals used their left hand for writing and eating, respectively, [22] though young Japanese are more likely to convert to using chopsticks right-handed than forks or spoons (29.3% to 4.6%). The proportion of females subjected to forced conversion is significantly higher compared to males (95.1% to 81.0%). [3]  Western countries [ which? ] have also attempted to convert left-handed children due to cultural, social and religious biases. Schools [ where? ] tend to urge children to use their right hands, sometimes against the wishes of the child's parents. In America [ when? ] some students have been physically punished for writing with their left hands (though nowadays left-handedness is more widely accepted): [13] "I was educated in the USA in Catholic school in the 60s. My left hand was beaten until it was swollen, so I would use my right right [sic] hand" ... "I had a teacher who would smack my left hand with a yardstick every time she caught me writing with my left hand" ... "My fourth grade teacher [...] would force me to use my right hand to perform all of my school work. If she caught me using my left hand, I was hit in the head with a dictionary. It turned out that she believed left handers were connected with Satan." [23]  Malawians cite their views that "the left hand is less skilled and less powerful than the right one" as main reasons for forcing left-handers to convert. Among students, teachers and parents, 75% said the left hand should not be used to perform habitual activities, and 87.6% of these believed left-handers should be forced to switch dominant hands. Parents and close relatives are most responsible for impressing these beliefs upon their children. [24]  Equipment [ edit ]     Left-handed (left) and right-handed scissors       Kitchen knives: (1) symmetrical, (2) right-handed, (3) left-handed. Cross sections seen from the handle.    Because the vast majority of the world population is right-handed, most everyday items are mass-produced for ease of use with the right hand. Tools, game equipment, musical instruments and other items must be specially ordered for left-handed use, if they are even produced and are usually more expensive than their right-handed counterparts.  Household items [ edit ]  Right-handed tools can be difficult, uncomfortable, or dangerous for left-handed people to use.  Scissors [ edit ]  For example (right-handed) scissors are arranged so that, in the right hand, fingers and thumb push the blades together laterally, creating the shearing action essential to scissors' utility. In the left hand, however, fingers and thumb tend to force right-handed blades apart, so that, rather than being sheared, the work-material is merely hacked, as by a knife, or slips between the blades uncut. [25] Left-handers using right-handed scissors will often try to compensate by forcing the handles apart laterally, causing discomfort or injury to the first knuckle of the thumb. [26]  In addition, a right-handed person using right-handed scissors can easily see the cutting line, but for a left-handed user the upper blade obscures the view. [27]  Many scissors are offered as "ambidextrous" or "suitable for right- or left-handed use." Typically, these are merely right-handed scissors with modified handles to permit use in the left hand with less discomfort, but because the blades are still arranged for right-handed use, they will not perform well in the left hand. [27]  Computer input devices [ edit ]  Input devices for computers can present obstacles to left-handed operation if intended for right-handed use. Some computer set-ups have the mouse placed on the right side of the keyboard and unable to be repositioned to the left. The mouse itself is also sometimes shaped to fit the right hand better. The functions of mouse buttons, even on mice shaped to fit both hands, default to right-hand use. On two-button mice, the left button —under the index finger of a right-handed person— is the primary button, while the right button performs secondary functions. The on-screen pointers themselves are also configured for right-handed people. Most desktop operating systems allow a user to reverse the functionality of mouse buttons to accommodate left-handed use, but left-handed cursors sometimes need to be specially downloaded. [28]  Trackballs and trackpads are often shaped for right-handed use. Even with the ability to change the functionality of buttons, these devices may be difficult for left-handed use. For a left handed person there are computer mice designed for left handed use, but they are a much smaller segment of the marketplace. [29]  Video game controllers often have the action buttons on the right with the directional controls on the left. In first-person shooters, many games default to the right pointer-finger being used to fire, simulating a right-handed person pulling the trigger of the weapon. Certain systems' layouts, such as Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS, have games in which right-handed stylus use is assumed and can cause difficulty for left-handed players. [30]     A right-handed trackball is difficult to use with the left hand.    Knives [ edit ]  While European-style kitchen knives are usually symmetrical, Japanese kitchen knives have the cutting edge ground asymmetrically, having the cutting edge closer to the user's body [ citation needed ] with ratios [ clarification needed ] ranging from 70–30 for the average chef's knife, to 90–10 for professional sushi chef knives; left-handed models are rare, and usually must be specially ordered or custom made. [31] On the other hand, the majority of "flat ground" general-purpose knives typically have the cutting edge on the right, as with a left-handed knife, for aesthetic reasons rather than practical. [ citation needed ]  Cameras [ edit ]  One of the few cameras ever produced for left-handers was the half-frame Yashica Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds. [ citation needed ]  Musical instruments [ edit ]  Left-handed adaptations have even bridged the world of music. Left-handed string instruments are produced, including guitars and violins .Inverted trumpets are made, too. Although the trumpet's valves are normally designed to be operated with the right hand, the prevailing belief is that left-handed trumpeters are not at a significant disadvantage. The French horn , for example, is played with the left hand, yet most horn players are right-handed. Left handed drummers also set up drum kits the exact opposite to conventional right-handed setup (i.e. hi-hat on the right, bass pedal under left foot, ride cymbal to the drummer's left, etc.).  Sports [ edit ]  A left-handed individual may be known as a southpaw, particularly in a sports context. It is widely accepted that the term originated in the United States, in the game of baseball . [32]  Ballparks are often designed so that batters are facing east, so that the afternoon or evening sun does not shine in their eyes. [33] This means that left-handed pitchers are throwing with their south-side arm. [34] The Oxford English Dictionary lists a non-baseball citation for "south paw", meaning a punch with the left hand, as early as 1848, [35] just three years after the first organized baseball game, with the note "(orig. U.S., in Baseball)." [36] A left-handed advantage in sports can be significant and even decisive, but this advantage usually results from a left-handed competitor's unshared familiarity with opposite-handed opponents. Baseball is an exception since batters, pitchers, and fielders in certain scenarios are physically advantaged or disadvantaged by their handedness.  In baseball, due to the direction in which curveballs and sliders break, it is generally accepted that the pitcher has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. For this reason, many baseball teams include a left-handed specialist pitcher, who is brought into the game specifically to pitch to dangerous left-handed batters in crucial situations. A left-handed first baseman uses a more fluid motion to tag out a baserunner returning to first base during a pickoff attempt by the pitcher and has less difficulty avoiding baserunners while presenting their mitt as a target for other fielders to throw to. It is very uncommon to see a left-handed player playing any infield position other than pitcher or first basemen due to the counterclockwise flow of the game when throwing the ball around the bases. A fielder's handedness is either a physical advantage or hindrance for similar reasons throughout the infield positions, and left-handedness is not always the more desirable dexterousness.  Left-handed bowlers are usually at an advantage during ten-pin bowling competition when hooking the ball into the pins from the left side of the lane. As there are fewer left-handed players, the lane's left side is not used as much, and thus the applied oil pattern does not change as quickly as it does for right-handed bowlers.  In boxing , someone who boxes left-handed is frequently referred to as southpaw. The term is also used to refer to a stance in which the boxer places the right foot in front of the left, so it is possible for a right-handed boxer to box with a southpaw stance . Most boxers, southpaw or otherwise, tend to train with sparring partners who adopt an orthodox stance which gives southpaws an advantage. Manny Pacquiao is an example of a southpaw (although he writes with his right hand). In the popular boxing film series Rocky , the main character Rocky Balboa is a southpaw. Southpaw is also a term in professional wrestling, often giving them the advantage.  Fencing weapons feature left- and right-handed grips, and a left-handed fencer's stance is opposite that of a right-handed opponent. Though commonly asserted that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed opponents because the line of defence favors their sword arm, this assertion describes both fencers in a mixed-handed duel, so neither competitor has a unique physical advantage. Thus the left-hander's advantage in fencing stems mostly from a right-hander's unfamiliarity with a left-handed stance.  The game of golf is most commonly played right-handed, and left-handed players typically must provide their own special golf clubs . [11] The game can be played with both hands, provided the player has both left- and right-handed clubs, giving an advantage over one-handed players. Professional golfer Phil Mickelson plays left-handed though he is naturally right-handed. [37]  In tennis, southpaws hold the racket in their left hand. Because of this, their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right-handed players. Some world champion left-handed tennis players include Jimmy Connors , Guillermo Vilas , John McEnroe , Martina Navratilova , Marcelo Ríos , Goran Ivanišević and Rafael Nadal .  Weapons [ edit ]     A US Navy SEALs left-handed shooter    The vast majority of firearms are designed for right-handed shooters, with the operating handle, magazine release, or safety mechanisms set up for manipulation by the right hand, and fired cartridge cases ejected to the right. Also, scopes and sights may be mounted in such a way as to require the shooter to place the rifle against the right shoulder. A left-handed shooter must either purchase a left-handed or ambidextrous firearm (which are manufactured in smaller numbers and are generally more expensive and/or harder to obtain), shoot a right-handed gun left-handed (which presents certain difficulties, such as the controls being improperly located for the left hand or hot shell cases being ejected towards the shooter's body, especially the eyes or down the collar or right sleeve), or learn to shoot right-handed (which may be less comfortable or "natural"). A related issue is ocular dominance , due to which left-handed people may wish to shoot right-handed, and vice versa. Ocular dominance plays more of a rule in shooting accuracy than does left versus right handiness. Therefore, ocular dominance will cause a preference on how a shooter chooses to hold a gun.  Some modern firearms are ambidextrous (e.g. the FN P90 and Heckler & Koch P7 ), or can be converted between right- and left-handed operation (e.g. the Heckler & Koch G36 and Steyr AUG ). Bullpup rifles are particularly problematic for left-handers unless they can be reconfigured, since empty shells would be ejected straight into the shooter's face and cheek potentially causing injury, or otherwise designed from the ground up for ambidextrous use, often by way of complex ejection systems as seen on the FN F2000 and the Kel-Tec RFB . The British L85 Assault Rifle must be fired right-handed, placing left-handed soldiers at a disadvantage. In contrast, the Steyr AUG is of a modular design and the ejection port and extractor can be switched/replaced to suit the handedness of the soldier operating it. The M-16 and its variants have a fixed ejection port, but being a conventional (i.e. not bullpup) design the ejection port is forward of the operator and hence able to be fired either-handed. Circa 1985, with the introduction of the M16A2 version, a case deflector was incorporated adjacent to the ejector port to direct discarded shells in a more forward direction, making the rifle even more left hand operator friendly. The deflector is not always effective, however, as the ejected shell still stands a chance of hitting the left-handed shooter's cheek, especially in windy conditions.  Lever action and pump action firearms present fewer difficulties for left-handers than bolt action weapons do. Many weapons with adjustable sights allow for left-handed use, but for a right eye dominant shooter it is necessary to adjust. In fact, most weapons adjust well enough that a weapon will not eject shells into a left-hander's eye.  Machinery [ edit ]  Power tools , machinery and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common problems faced by left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations. [2]  Table saws , whose blades protrude from the top of a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On bandsaws , the blade teeth are on the left side of the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand.  Handheld circular saws are made almost exclusively for right-handers, with the motor and grip on the right side. If held in the left hand, it is impossible for the operator to see what they are cutting. Tool manufacturer Porter-Cable produces a left-handed circular saw that can be purchased relatively inexpensively. [2]               Left-handed Remington 700 rifle action—note that the bolt handle is not visible from this side               A table saw . Notice how the cutting surface, fence, etc. are on the right side        Language [ edit ]  Historically, the left side, and subsequently left-handedness, was considered negative. The word "left" itself derives from the Anglo-Saxon word lyft , "weak". [38] In Ancient Greek both words meaning "left" were euphemisms : the word ἀριστερός , aristerós (the standard word in Modern Greek as well) is derived from ἂριστος, áristos , "best", and the word εὺώνυμος , euōnymos , "of good name", is another euphemism used in lieu of "ill-named". The Latin adjective sinister/sinistra/sinistrum originally meant "left" but took on meanings of "evil" or "unlucky" by the Classical Latin era, and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin , and in the English word "sinister". Alternatively, sinister comes from the Latin word sinus meaning "pocket": a traditional Roman toga had only one pocket, located on the left side. The right hand has historically been associated with skill: the Latin word for right-handed is dexter , as in "dexterity", meaning manual skill. Even the word " ambidexterity " reflects the bias . Its intended meaning is "skillful on both sides". However, since it keeps the Latin root dexter , which means "right", it ends up conveying the idea of being "right-handed on both sides". This bias is also apparent in the lesser-known antonym "ambisinistrous", which means "left-handed [ i.e. , clumsy] on both sides". [39] In more technical contexts, "sinistral" may be used in place of "left-handed" and "sinistrality" in place of "left-handedness". [40] In both Ancient Greek and Roman religion , auspices (usually the flight paths of birds, as observed by a bird-diviner, or augur ) were thought to be unfavorable if appearing on the diviner's left-hand side and favorable if on the right: an ancient custom mentioned in Homer 's Iliad and of apparently Middle Eastern origin (as attested in the Amarna correspondence , in which a king of Alashiya , i.e. Cyprus , requests an eagle-diviner from the Pharaoh of Egypt).  Meanings gradually developed from use of these terms in the ancient languages. In many modern European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper", and also stands for authority and justice.  In Sanskrit, the word "वाम" (waama) stands for both "left" and "wicked."  In most Slavic languages the root prav (right) is used in words carrying meanings of correctness or justice. In colloquial Russian the word левый (levyĭ) "left" means unofficial, counterfeit, strange. In Polish, the word prawo means "right" as well as "law", prawy means: lawful; the word lewy means "left" (opposite of right), and colloquially "illegal" (opposite of legal).  In French, droit(e) ( cognate to English direct ) means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right", while gauche means "left" and is also a synonym of maladroit , literally "not right", meaning "clumsy". Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German have similar constructs. The Spanish term diestro and the Italian term destro mean both "right-handed" and "skillful". The contemporary Italian word sinistra has both meanings of sinister and left (the masculine adjective for sinister being sinistro ), and maldestro means "clumsy". The Spanish siniestra has both, too, although the "left" meaning is less common and is usually expressed by izquierda , [41] a Basque word that made its way into Portuguese as well. In some Spanish-speaking countries, to do something por izquierda means to engage in corrupt conduct or employ illegitimate means, whereas por derecha or a derechas means to do it the right (legitimate) way. [42] Also, in Spanish, to tell someone "Eres tan zurdo" means that they are being clumsy, though the literal meaning is "You're so lefty." In Portuguese, the most common word for left-handed person, canhoto , was once used to identify the devil , and canhestro , a related word, means "clumsy".  In Romanian drept/dreaptă (coming from Latin directus ) means both "right" and "straight". The word for "left" is stâng/stângă coming from Latin stancus (= stanticus ) meaning "tired". [43]  In German, recht means "right" in both the adjectival sense (correct) and the nominal (legal entitlement). The word for "left" is links , and is closely related to both link (underhand, questionable), and linkisch (clumsy). [44] [45]  The Dutch words for "left" ( links, linker ) and "right" ( recht, rechts, rechter ) have much the same meanings and connotations as in English. The adjective link means "cunning, shifty" or "risky". A linkerd is a "crafty devil". To look at someone over the left shoulder ( iemand over de linkerschouder aanzien ) is to regard him or her as insignificant. [46]  In Irish, deas means "right side" and "nice". Ciotóg is the left hand and is related to ciotach meaning "awkward"; [47]  ciotógach (kyut-OH-goch) is the term for left-handed. In Welsh, the word chwith means "left", but can also mean "strange", "awkward", or "wrong". The Scots term for left-handedness is corrie fistit . The term can be used to convey clumsiness.  In Finnish, the word oikea means both "right" (okay, correct) and "right" (the opposite of left).  In Swedish, att göra något med vänsterhanden (literally "to do something with your left hand") means "to do something badly". In Swedish, vänster means "left". The term vänsterprassel means "infidelity", "adultery" and "cheating". From this term the verb vänstra (lit. "lefting") is derived.  In Hungarian, the word for right is jobb , which also means "better". The word for left is bal , which also means "bad". In Estonian, the word pahem stands for both "left" and "worse" and the word parem stands for both "right" and "better".  In Turkish, the word for right is sağ , which means "alive". The word for left is sol , which means "discolor", "die", "ill".  In Chinese culture, the adjective "left" ( Chinese character : 左 , Mandarin : zuǒ ) sometimes means "improper" or "out of accord". For instance, the phrase "left path" ( 左 道 , zuǒdào ) stands for unorthodox or immoral means.  In Korean, the word for right is oreun (오른), to be compared to the word meaning morally proper, orheun (옳은) which shares the same pronunciation. [48]  In Hebrew, as well as in other ancient Semitic and Mesopotamian languages, the term "left" was a symbol of power or custody. [49] There were also examples of left-handed assassins in the Old Testament (Ehud killing the Moabite king). The left hand symbolized the power to shame society, and was used as a metaphor for misfortune, natural evil , or punishment from the gods. This metaphor survived ancient culture and was integrated into mainstream Christianity by early Catholic theologians , such as Ambrose of Milan , [50] to modern Protestant theologians, such as Karl Barth , [51] to attribute natural evil to God in explaining God's omnipotence over the universe.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (August 2014)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The left side is often associated with awkwardness and clumsiness. The Spanish expression " tener dos pies izquierdos ", in English, the expression "to have two left feet", refers to clumsiness in the domains of football or dancing. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. The Polish expression " mieć dwie lewe ręce ", Dutch " twee linkerhanden hebben ", German " zwei linke Hände haben ", the Bulgarian expression " dve levi ratse ", French " avoir deux mains gauches ", Hungarian kétbalkezes and Czech " Mít obě ruce levé " all mean "to have two left hands"—that one is clumsy or is a very poor handyman; the English equivalent is "to be all thumbs". Moreover, the German idiom " mit dem linken Fuß aufgestanden sein ", the Spanish expression " levantarse con el pie izquierdo ", the French expression " s'être levé du pied gauche " and the Hungarian expression " bal lábbal kelt fel " (literally, to get up with the left foot) mean to have a bad day and do everything wrong or unsuccessfully, related to the English expression "to get up on the wrong side of the bed". The Welsh phrase " tu chwith allan " (left side out) refers to an object being inside-out. [52] In Russian, the use of the term nalyevo means "on the left", but can also connote taking bribes or "sneaky" behavior. Balszerencse (lit. "left luck") is Hungarian for "bad luck".  There are many colloquial terms used to refer to a left-handed person, e.g. "southpaw" (USA). Some are just slang or jargon words, while other references may be offensive or demeaning, either in context or in origin. In some parts of the English-speaking world, "cack-handed" is slang for left-handed, and is also used to mean clumsy. The origin of this term is disputed, but some suggest it is derived from the Latin cacare , in reference to the habit of performing ablutions with the left hand, leaving the right hand "clean". [53] [54] However, other sources suggest that it is derived from the Old Norse word keikr , meaning "bent backwards". [55] Australians frequently use "cacky-handed". A less common Australian slang word for a left-handed individual is the term Molly-Dooker , whose origins cannot be determined with certainty. [56]  Handwriting [ edit ]  Left-handed people who speak Arabic , Persian , Urdu , Hebrew or any other right-to-left script do not have the same difficulties with writing. The right-to-left nature of these languages prevents left-handers from running their hand on the ink as happens with left-to-right languages. Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, it is considered easier to write the Latin alphabet with the right hand than with the left. Furthermore, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the person in question. [57]  Left-to-right alphabets can be written smudge-free and in proper "forward slant" with the left hand if the paper is turned 1/4 turn clockwise (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do calligraphy in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs. Otherwise, left-handed pen nibs are required in order to get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed pen nibs are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th-century copperplate hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point.  Civic life [ edit ]  Schooling [ edit ]  As the majority of students in public schools are right-handed, most commonly used implements are designed for the right-handed, from pencil sharpeners to scissors to desks . The consequences to left-handed students can vary from decreased academic performance or physical ailments to nothing at all. [58]  In many classrooms and lecture halls , desks are designed so that the writing surface is attached to the chair instead of separate from it. In this design, the desk is attached on the right side, offering an armrest for right-handed people to use while writing. In some of these desks, the writing surface does not extend fully to the left, necessitating a left-handed user to turn their body in order to write properly, sometimes causing back, neck and shoulder problems. [58] [59] This contorted posture may also cause the student to be accused of cheating . [60] In some cases, however, large lecture halls will use left-handed desks on the left-most column of each section so that left-handed people can comfortably write without bumping against a neighbor.  This right-handed bias is reflected in standardized tests as well. Multiple-choice tests tend to put the question on the left side of the page and the answers on the right side. If the answers must be filled in in a separate booklet, it can be awkward and uncomfortable for a left-handed student to line up the booklet with the answers. The time it takes to find a comfortable, convenient position cuts into test-taking time, resulting in rushed answers and unchecked work. [58] [59]  In Vietnam , schools officially require students to write with their right hands, and some teachers of Grade 1 (when writing is taught) would implement that rule by deducting points from tests written by the left hand. The Civic Education textbook for grade 7 mentions a student thanking her old teacher for helping her write with her right hand, and stopping her from using her left hand to write.  Employment [ edit ]  In research done on the relations of handedness and employment, researchers may start their experiments believing left-handers earn lower wages than their right-handed counterparts, due to effects like difficulty using right-handed tools and increased rate of illness among left-handed people. [61] [ not in citation given ] However, their findings are more complex. In studies in the United States and United Kingdom, it was found that left-handed men earn more than right-handed men; about 5% more in the UK. Conversely, left-handed women earn about 7.5% less than right-handed women.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.  “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.  “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

Measuring Handedness  Handedness Statistics  Handedness and the Brain  Theories of Handedness ‣  Other Handedness Issues ‣  History of Handedness ‣  Famous Left-Handers ‣  A Few Final Thoughts  Sources      E-mail: lukem@lukemastin.com  Web-site designed by: Luke Mastin     Tweet           Handedness Statistics          Estimates for the prevalence of left-handedness vary significantly - anywhere between 2% and 30% - reflecting the ambiguities and inconsistencies inherent in the defining handedness (see the section on Measuring Handedness ), but also sometimes the biases and unreliability of the sources. Best estimates for left-handedness in the relatively permissive cultures of the developed Western world (roughly North America and Western Europe) is around 12% . In more formal cultures that stress conformity, such as Asian, Muslim and Latin American countries , the rates tend to be much lower . For example, Korea (2%), Japan (3%) and Taiwan (5%) have the lowest levels of left-handedness, possibly reflecting the systematic discouragement of left-handedness that still persists in these countries. The difficulty of teaching complex Chinese and Japanese calligraphy has been suggested as another reason why children there are more likely to adopt the same handedness as their teachers. Overall, worldwide , a rough figure of about 10% seems likely. However, it could be argued that the statistics from more permissive and less conformist societies like North America may in fact give a “truer” and less distorted indication of the relative numbers of left-handedness, as they are less influenced by extraneous social and political factors . Indeed, it is perhaps a testament to the tenacity and persistence of left-handedness that there are still any left-handers at all in Eastern cultures like Korea and Japan. Demographic Variations Within the 12% of North Americans who claim left-handedness, there are some interesting demographic variations. As regards gender , men are slightly more likely than women to be left-handed, with most studies indicating that about 13% of men and just under 11% of women are left-handed (men are NOT twice as likely to be left-handed as is sometimes claimed). It has been suggested this occurs because girls are more receptive to social mores and more likely to conform than boys (although there may also be a genetic component ). In the same way, the percentage of left-handers tends to be much smaller than the overall average among Chinese Americans , those who attended Catholic schools , and older generations raised in the more conformist Pre-War years. The variations due to age demographics are particularly striking, with one major study indicating that about 15% of under-30s are left-handed writers, compared to only 6% of over-65s . Other statistics back up this trend: a century ago , only about 2-3% of North Americans were, or at least admitted to being, left-handed, compared to around 12% today. An analysis of the underlying trends shows a steady increase in left-handedness from the beginning of the 20th Century until about the middle of the century, after which it stabilizes at about 12%. This is unlikely to be due to any genetic factors, and probably reflects the changing attitudes towards left-handedness (a relaxation of the stigma and social pressure against it) and the educational reforms against systematic switching during education. By some estimates, 6-8% of right-handed Americans, particularly among older generations, are actually natural left-handers who have been forced (or at least encouraged) to switch at a young age, with an unknown number of others having switched before their memories reliably begin. Interestingly, left-handedness is almost twice as likely among twins as among the general population. Left-handed parents are also about twice as likely to produce twin offspring. And finally, left-handers are about twice as likely to have left-handed children as right-handers. These statistics suggest intuitively that there is some sort of link between twins and handedness, but just what that link might be has been perplexingly resistant to discovery. There are, of course, also major inconsistencies between the two phenomena of left-handedness and twins, not the least of which being that monozygotic (or "identical") twins occur only 3 or 4 times out of every 1,000 births (as compared to over 100 in every 1,000 for left-handedness). In past times (and presumably in some countries even today), it seems possible that the long-standing prejudice against left-handedness could even have interfered with the mating prospects of left-handers. A 1992 meta-study by Chris MacManus and Phil Bryden showed that, prior to 1955, two right-handed parents averaged 3.1 children, a right-handed and a left-handed parent averaged 2.69 children, and two left-handers just 2.32. Interestingly, since 1955, this situation has actually completely reversed , suggesting that left-handers are now in the ascendancy, although the implications of this in the longer term are not clear. Mixed-Handedness         Some estimates claim that as many as 30% within the developed world may be classified as “non-right-handed” , a much broader category which includes mixed-handed and ambidextrous individuals, although the limitations of testing techniques and of the definition of parameters make such sweeping claims difficult to justify (see the section on Measuring Handedness ). Most people fall towards the extremes of the left-right continuum of handedness, with over 60% strongly or completely right-handed and another 20% or more quite strongly right-handed. Very few are strongly or completely left-handed (less than 3%), and even fewer are evenly mixed-handed or ambidextrous. The resulting graph of handedness is sometimes described as “J-shaped” , with a small uptick for strong left-handedness, a big dip in the middle and a steeply-rising and much larger uptick towards strong right-handedness. In some respects, mixed-handedness is more prevalent towards the left hand side of the scale than the right. Another way of looking at this is that left-handedness is more likely to be a weak handeness preference , whereas right-handedness is more likely to be a strong  preference . For example, about half of all left-handers (who write with their left hands) prefer to throw a ball with their right hands, and actually do so more accurately than with their left. Conversely, only about 2% of right-handed writers prefer to throw left. Other Aspects of Laterality Other studies have attempted to estimate other aspects of laterality. Around 80% favour their right foot , 70% their right eye , and 60% their right ear . Sidedness in other parts of the body, though, is not necessarily consistent with a person's handedness: for example, around 40% of left-handers are right-eye dominant, and almost 50% are right-footed. However, we should perhaps expect handedness and “eyedness” to be independent of each other, as there is no real direct analogy between the two phenomena (both hemispheres of the brain control both eyes, with each hemisphere processing a different half of the retina of each eye). Also, foot use does not require anything like the same level of motor control as hand use. Other (less important but nonetheless interesting aspects) of laterality include hand-clasping and arm-folding. Hand-clasping can be demonstrated by quickly clasping your hands together, interlacing the fingers in what feels like the most natural way. About 60% of people, regardless of whether they are left-handed or right-handed, clasp their hands with the left thumb on top. Arm-folding also shows evidence of a type of handedness: when you fold your arms naturally, take note of which wrist is on top . Again, about 60% fold their arms with the left wrist on top (and indeed find it quite difficult to do otherwise), and once again, it appears to be totally independent of either a person’s handedness or their hand-clasping preference. The direction of the hair whorl on the crown of the head is another example of laterality, with about three-quarters of people having a clockwise whorl (causing a tendency for the hair to naturally part on the left), and a quarter anti-clockwise (although different studies have yielded results anywhere from 65% to 92%). Research by Amar Klar indicates that about 45% of left-handers have anti-clockwise hair whorls, compared to only about 8% of right-handers, suggesting a possible genetic link between the two phenomena, but it is by no means a simple link.

Left-handers are the odd men out.  Sure, lefties make up about 10 percent of the population -- but, frankly, it seems like society has forgotten about them. Right-handed gadgets, awkwardly designed desks, cooking tools that fit comfortably in your right hand (now that’s just wrong!).  More From Everyday Health:  10 Tips To Improve Your Memory  Unraveling The Meaning Of Dreams  8 Fascinating Pain Facts You Didn't Know  What causes someone to become a southpaw? Scientists aren’t exactly sure, but research points to a complex collaboration between genes and environment. While no exact set of “leftie genes” have been discovered, people who dominantly use their left hands do have more left-handed family members. And researchers have found different brain wirings in righties vs. lefties.  But no matter what it is that drives someone to use their antipodal paw, science has also uncovered a particular set of personality traits that left-handed people tend to have. So for all of you lefties, leftie-loving righties and ambidextrous folks out there -- it’s time to brush up on your left-handed knowledge and help put an end to leftie discrimination once and for all.      PHOTO GALLERY  11 Facts About Left-Handers      Left-handers are the minority -- so does that mean they’ll go extinct one day? Nah! In fact, some researchers believe that when it comes to survival of the fittest, lefties come out on top.  Here’s why: In man-on-man combat, using the left-hand is like throwing a curveball. "The fact that left-handers are less common means they have a surprise effect," University of Montpellier researcher Charlotte Faurie told ABC News. To dig deeper, Faurie and her colleague Michel Raymond studied nine different primitive societies. In more violent societies, they found that lefties thrived (think southpaw slugger Rocky Balboa’s left hook).  Looks like the left hand has the upper hand after all.

Lefties Hear Speeches Differently  People who are using their left hands when listening may more easily hear rapidly changing sounds than those who are using their right hands, according to a study from Georgetown University Medical Center. The researchers who conducted the study, presented at Neuroscience 2012, found that the left and right hemispheres of the brain specialize in different kinds of sounds -- the left hemisphere, which controls the right hand, likes rapidly changing sounds like consonants, while the right hemisphere, which controls the left hand, likes slowly changing sounds, like syllables or intonation. According to the researchers, if you're waving an American flag while listening to a presidential candidate, the speech will sound slightly different to you depending on whether you're holding the flag in your left or right hand. The research could ultimately result in better treatment for stroke and language disorders.

She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

This article was written by Keith Milsom, owner of Anything Left-Handed, in response to lots of questions from Left Handers Club members.  About 10% of the world's population are left-handed and it seems that left-handedness runs in families, with the handedness of the mother being an important factor.  So what are the chances of having a left-handed child?  Various studies have shown that around 10% of the world's population are naturally left-handed and that this seems to be a fairly consistent figure over a long period of time and in all countries and cultures.  The way left-handedness is measured and the fact that many cultures deliberately suppress left-handedness complicate the picture, but left-handedness seems to stay at about that level anyway.  More recent studies among children show a higher level,  may be increasing.  It also seems to run in families, although no gene for left-handedness has been isolated and it is not possible to predict left-handedness in the same way as, say, eye colour. What we do know is that the more left-handers you have in the family, the more chance of having left-handed children.  The probabilities of various left-right parent combinations having a left-handed child vary quite a lot depending on which research you look at.  Dr Chris McManus reported in his book Left Hand, Right Hand on a study he had done based on a review of scientific literature which showed parent handedness for 70,000 children.  On average, the chances of two right-handed parents having a left-handed child were around 9% left-handed children, two left-handed parents around 26% and one left and one right-handed parent around 19%.  In The Left-Handers Handbook, Diane Paul, repeated this and also noted that Left-handed mothers are more likely to have left-handed children than left-handed fathers.  This was based on research done by Stanley Coren for his book The Left Hander Syndrome, where he showed the chances of  two right-handed parents having a left-handed child were around 10%, a right-handed mother and left-handed father the same, 10%, left-handed mother and right-handed father 20% and two left-handed parents 35%.  A large survey carried out by Anything Left-Handed showed that only 1.4% of left-handers who responded had two left-handed parent, 24% had one left-handed parent and 75% had two right-handed parents.  Are all these numbers consistent with each other?  If those percentages are true, would the level of left-handedness in the population as a whole stay at a consistent level?  I have produced a model that calculates the mix of handedness in parents and then multiples by the assumed probabilities for each mix having left-handed children to calculate the total number of left-handed children and their percentage of the population.  For example, if 10% of the population is left-handed, only 1% of all couples will be made up of two left-handers (like me an my wife, but there is a theory that left-handers attract each other which would distort this, but that is for another article!).  Putting Chris McManus's percentages into the model shows an increase from 10% to 11.5% in the level of left-handedness in the population in one generation and if that continued for very long left-handers would no longer be in the minority!  Stanley Coren's figures, although quite different, also give an increase in left-handedness to 11.2% and neither of them give a match to the figures from the Anything Left-Handed survey.  Most significantly, the number of left-handed children with two left-handed parents is 2.3% for McManus and 3.1% for Coren.  To get down to the level of only 1.4% found in the Anything Left-Handed survey, the chances of two left-handed parents having a left-handed child need to be reduced to around 14% - much closer to the other parent mixes.  Juggling the figures to get the best match to all these results, plus also keeping the level of left-handedness stable at around 10%, these probabilities of having a left-handed child seem to fit:  Two right handed parents, 9% Left handed father, 12% Left handed mother, 16% Two left handed parents, 20%  There are many more variables that affect these figures and one study showed that left-handers have less children on average that right handers. This is meant to be a guide rather than a scientific conclusion.  However, whichever set of assumptions you use, some interesting figures come out:  *  More than 50% of left-handers do not know of any other left-hander anywhere in their living family.  *  Around 75% of left-handers have two right-handed parents and only 2% have two left-handed parents.  *  Between 7 and 8 out of 10 children born to two left handed parent will be right handed.  Of course, the chances of having a left-hander in the family increase the more children you have.  So there is still hope for right-handed parents - if you have enough children, you may still be lucky enough to have a left-hander!  Keith's model of left-handedness  This is my Excel sheet used for calculating left-handed probabilities.

Left-handers are the odd ones out. Sure, lefties make up about 10 percent of the population — but, frankly, it seems like society has forgotten about them. Just consider all of the right-handed gadgets, awkwardly designed desks, and cooking tools that fit comfortably only in your right hand. What causes someone to become a southpaw? Scientists aren’t exactly sure, but research points to a complex collaboration between genes and environment. While no exact set of “leftie genes” have been discovered, people who dominantly use their left hands do have more left-handed family members. And researchers have found different brain wirings in righties vs. lefties. But no matter what it is that drives someone to use their antipodal paw, science has also uncovered a particular set of personality traits that left-handed people tend to have. So for all of you lefties, leftie-loving righties, and ambidextrous folks out there — it’s time to brush up on your left-handed knowledge and help put an end to leftie discrimination once and for all.   Lefties Have a Higher Risk of Psychosis Lefties make up about 10 percent of the general population. But researchers have found that in populations with certain mental disorders, that rate goes up. Previous studies have found that people with psychosis had a 20 percent likelihood of being left-handed, though a small study in the journal SAGE found the rate of psychotic lefties may be even higher. Researchers at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas assessed 107 patients at outpatient psychiatric clinics. For those with mood disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder , the rate of left-handedness was close to average, at 11 percent. But in people with psychosis, such as those with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the rate of left-handedness was 40 percent, well above average. Researchers theorize brain laterality plays a role.   Your Handedness May Determine Your Health Scientists have also found an increased risk for dyslexia, ADHD , and certain mood disorders in left-handed people, according to a 2010 study published in Pediatrics. Researchers are not exactly sure how to explain this phenomenon, but many believe it's related to how the brain is wired. Your noggin is divided into two halves: the left side and the right side. Most people (righties and lefties alike) rely on the brain's left hemisphere for tasks like language functioning. But about 30 percent of left-handed folks are either partial to the right hemisphere or have no dominant hemisphere at all. According to scientists, having one hemisphere dominate is much more efficient, which is why some left-handers are at increased risk for learning impairments and brain disorders. But lefties may be in luck when it comes to other health conditions: Results of a large survey published in the journal Laterality found that left-handers had lower rates of arthritis and ulcers.   Lefties Hear Speeches Differently People who use their left hands when listening may more easily hear slowly-changing sounds than those who use their right hands, according to a study from Georgetown University Medical Center. The researchers who conducted the study, presented at Neuroscience 2012, found that the left and right hemispheres of the brain specialize in different kinds of sounds. The left hemisphere, which controls the right hand, likes rapidly-changing sounds like consonants, while the right hemisphere, which controls the left hand, likes slowly-changing sounds like syllables or intonation. According to the researchers, if you're waving an American flag while listening to a presidential candidate, the speech will sound slightly different to you depending on whether you're holding the flag in your left or right hand. The research could ultimately result in better treatment for stroke and language disorders. Update: An earlier version of this post stated that people who use their left hands may more easily hear rapidly-changing sounds that those who use their right hands. In fact, left-handers hear slow-changing sounds better.   Left-Handed Neanderthals Were the Minority, Too Right-handed bias isn’t just a modern-day phenomenon: It turns out we’ve been dominantly using our right hooks for more than 500,000 years. University of Kansas researchers recently determined the handedness of ancient humans by studying — oddly enough — their teeth. The study, which was published in the journal Laterality, found that when our great-great-great-great-(you get the point)-grandfathers processed animal hides, they would hold one side of the carcass in one hand and the other in their mouth. By locating the wear and tear on those prehistoric chompers, scientists were able to determine whether our prehistoric ancestors were using their left hand or right hand more dominantly "All you need to have is a single tooth, and you can tell if our assumptions are right — if the individual is right- or left-handed," study researcher David Frayer, Ph.D., told LiveScience . The results? "The fossils are just like humans in that we are mostly right-handed, and so were they."   Lefties Make Better Artists Southpaws have been bragging about their creative clout for years. But is it true — does being left-handed mean you’re also more likely to be artistic or innovative? According to research published in the American Journal of Psychology , there is some evidence that left-handed people have the upper hand in at least one creative facet: They’re better at divergent thinking, a method of idea generation that explores many possible solutions. To determine whether lefties were more likely to pursue creative careers than righties, the folks behind the Left-Handers Club (a pro-leftie group dedicated to left-handed research and product development) surveyed more than 2,000 left-handed, right-handed, and ambidextrous participants and found that lefties tended to find advantages and be drawn to careers in the arts, music, sports, and information-technology fields. But that may also add up to lower paychecks: According to a report in the Wall Street Journal , left-handers’ salaries are 10 percent lower on average than those of right-handers. AFP/Getty Images  We Vote for Left-Handers! It doesn’t matter which way they swing politically: A surprisingly high percentage of recent U.S. presidents were on the left (in terms of handedness, of course). The lengthy list of left-handed leaders includes four of the last seven commanders in chief — President Obama , Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Gerald Ford — as well as past presidents James Garfield and Harry Truman. In fact, there’s a rumor that Ronald Reagan was born a leftie, but stringent schoolteachers converted him to a righty when he was young. Should right-handed presidential wannabes fake it? Our penchant for left-handed POTUSes is probably pure coincidence. But one recent Dutch study suggests that left-handed politicians actually have an advantage in televised debates. As a whole, people tend to associate right-handed gestures with “good” and left-handed gestures with “bad,” according to the researchers. Since television presents a mirror image, the lefties are the ones who appear to gesture with their right hands (the “good” hand). Getty Images  Southpaws Will Beat You in Sports Golf legend Phil Mickelson, tennis ace Rafael Nadal, boxing champ Oscar de la Hoya — did you know that a number of your favorite sports superstars are lefties? Actually, left-handers may have the advantage in sports that involve two opponents facing each other, such as in tennis, boxing, and baseball, according to an MSNBC review of the book The Puzzle of Left-Handedness, by Rik Smits. The author chalks it up to the fact that left-handed athletes get a lot more opportunity to practice against right-handed opponents than vice versa (since there are so many more righties out there). Now that’s a home run for lefties.   Lefties Are Scaredy-Cats Boo! If you’re a left-hander, that probably made you cringe. That’s because people whose left hands are dominant tend to be more affected by fear than people who use their right hands, according to research presented at an annual conference of The British Psychological Society and reported in the Telegraph. For the study, participants watched an eight-minute clip from the frightening film Silence of the Lambs. When asked to recall events from the segment, lefties were far more likely to show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder than righties, including giving fragmented descriptions and making more mistakes. "It seems that after experiencing a fearful event, even on film, people who are left-handed had subtle behaviors that were like people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder," head researcher Carolyn Choudhary, PhD, told t he Telegraph. Blame the brain: “It is apparent that the two sides of the brain have different roles in PTSD, and the right hand-side of the brain seems to be involved in fear. But we need to do more experiments to understand what exactly is going on here,” she said.   Grrr! Left-Handers Get Angrier, Too If you just can’t let go of that spat you had with your right-handed pal (but he seemed to move on just fine), you may be able to blame it on your left-handedness. According to a small study published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease , lefties are more prone to having negative emotions. In addition, they seem to have a more difficult time processing their feelings. Again, this seems to be related to the brain-hand connection. Compared to righties, left-handed participants in the study showed an imbalance in activity between the left and right hemispheres when trying to process their moodiness .   Easily Embarrassed? Could Be Because You're a Leftie Aw-shucks. Lefties may get bent out of shape, but research shows they're just a bunch of bashful self-observers . When scientists from Abertay University in Scotland gave 46 lefties and 66 righties  behavioral tests to measure their impulsiveness and personal restraint , the left-handers in the group more commonly agreed with statements like "I worry about making mistakes" and "Criticism or scolding hurts me quite a bit." In fact, their answers left researchers believing that lefties tend to feel more inhibited, shy, and embarrassed than their right-handed counterparts. "Left-handers are more likely to hesitate, whereas right-handers tend to jump in a bit more," lead researcher Lynn Wright, PhD, told BBC News .   Lefties Like to Booze Next time you have a run-in with a boozed-up barfly, check out which hand he’s holding his whisky with: chances are, it’ll be his left. For years, myth has held that left-handers are more likely to become alcoholics . Research into the topic was murky, however, and relied on small samples. But a survey of more than 25,000 people from 12 countries has cleared things up a bit. While lefties are not more prone to alcoholism, they do drink more often. Researcher Kevin Denny, who examined the data for a paper published in the British Journal of Health Psychology , says the main takeaway should be debunking that whole left-handedness-alcoholism link. “There is no evidence that handedness predicts risky drinking,” he stated in a press release. “Hence, the results do not support the idea that excess drinking may be a consequence either of atypical lateralisation of the brain, or due to the social stresses that arise from left-handers' being a minority group.”   They Have Their Own Day! Mark your calendar: August 13 is International Left-Handers Day. Lefties across the globe celebrate the annual event, which was launched in 1992 by the UK-based Left-Handers Club to increase awareness about the left-handed lifestyle. According to the group's Web site, it’s a day “when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed.” How should you observe the occasion? Create a “leftie zone”: a designated area of personal space where everything must be done in a left-handed fashion, from your workspace setup to the way you use cutlery. And that rule also extends to any right-handers who happen to enter the leftie zone.   Lefties Aren't Going Anywhere Left-handers are the minority. So does that mean they’ll go extinct one day? In fact, some researchers believe that when it comes to survival of the fittest, lefties come out on top. Here’s why: In one-on-one combat, using the left-hand is like throwing a curveball. "The fact that left-handers are less common means they have a surprise effect," University of Montpellier researcher Charlotte Faurie told ABC News . To dig deeper, Faurie and her colleague Michel Raymond studied nine different primitive societies. In more violent societies, they found, lefties thrived (think southpaw slugger Rocky Balboa’s left hook). Looks like the left hand has the upper hand after all.

A report published in the journal Current Biology reveals the birds show a preference for which side they hold sticks when using them to poke larvae out of holes.  Scientists believe the left or right bias is connected to their vision – and the clever crows try to keep the tip of the stick in view of their strongest eye.  Humans have been arguing about left and right for centuries. In medieval times lefties were thought to be in league with the devil and considered less intelligent than right-handers.  Then modern research discovered the wiring of our brains controls which hand we favour – and that left handers may be more artistic, are better tennis players and grow up quicker than right handers.  Here’s how lefties and righties compare...   Just 12 per cent of the world’s population are left handed – and twice as many men as women. 30 per cent of us are mixed-handed and switch hands during some tasks. Ambidextrous people can do any task equally well with either hand, but it’s exceptionally rare. Ambilevous or ambisinister are awkward with both hands.  Our brains are cross-wired meaning the left hemisphere controls the right handed side of the body and vice-versa. So left handers can boast they are always in their right mind.              President: The most powerful man in the world is left-handed  (Image: Getty)     The left hemisphere also controls speech, language, writing, logic, maths and science while the right side controls controls music, art, creativity, perception, emotions, and genius. So left-handers are more likely to be creative and visual thinkers, better at 3D perception...which is why there are more left-handed architects than righties.  Right handed people will earn 12 per cent more over their lifetimes than lefties. A study of 47,000 people in the UK and US suggest left-handers are at a significant disadvantage in the workplace. Harvard economist Joshua Goodman claimed “lefties have more emotional and behavioural problems, have more learning disabilities such as dyslexia, complete less schooling, and work in occupations requiring less cognitive skill.”  During the Middle Ages, left-handed folk were thought to be possessed by the Devil – prompting the modern definition of the word sinister which comes from sinistra, the Latin word for left.  The English word left comes from the Old English lyft, meaning idle, weak, or useless. The French word for left, gauche, also means clumsy or awkward.  Christianity is strongly based towards the right hand. It is the right had that gives the blessing and makes the sign of the cross. The bible contains more than 100 favourable references to the right-hand and 25 unfavourable references to the left-hand.              May the lord be with the rightys: The Bible seemingly favours right-handed people  (Image: Getty)     Stone Age implements discovered seem equally divided between left and right and studies of cave drawings have indicated a preference for the left hand.  Nails grow faster on your dominant hand.  If both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. In 2006 a study of twins from 25,732 families suggest just 24 per cent had inherited it. Researchers recently located a gene they think controls handedness.  Research in 2001 suggested lefties tend to die three years younger than righties although extremely left-handed people have a life expectancy that is just one year lower.  Left-handers get all sorts of strange – and often unpleasant – nicknames. Researchers found 88 different words in English dialects including: gar-pawed, cack-handed, gibble-fisted, scoochy, kay-neived, corrie-fisted, cuddy-wifted and kittaghy.  In Australia they are “mollydookers”, in Italian it’s “mancino” meaning crooked and in the US they are “southpaws” - a term derived from baseball. Parks were often built with the homeplate in the western corner of the field. When a left-handed pitcher was facing the batsman, his throwing arm would be the closest to the south, hence ‘Southpaw’ was coined.  The Meru people of Kenya believed that the left-hand of their holy man possessed such evil power that he had to keep it hidden for the safety of others.  Four of the five original designers of the Macintosh computer were left-handed as were one in four Apollo astronauts including Neil Armstrong.              Neil Armstrong: The first man on the moon was a lefty     Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci were both left-handed. Other famous lefties include Jack The Ripper, Napoleon Bonaparte, Joan of Arc, the Queen Mother Prince William, Winston Churchill, Tom Cruise, Morgan Freema, Judy Garland, Chewbacca the Wookie, Bob Geldof, Jimi Hendrix and Sir Paul McCartney.  Left handers are more likely to have allergies, migraines and insomnia and are three times more likely to become alcoholics as the right side of the brain - which is dominant in left handers - has a lower tolerance to alcohol!  Right handed people reach puberty four to five months earlier than lefties.  Left handers make especially good baseball players, tennis players, swimmers, boxers and fencers. Almost 40% of the top tennis players are lefties, including Rafael Nadal who has won 14 grand slam titles.  August 13th has been declared International Left Handers Day.  Five of the seven most recent U.S Presidents have been left handed – Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and current leader Barack Obama .  On a QWERTY keyboard there are 1447 English words typed solely with the left hand, whilst only 187 are typed with the right hand.  The official Boy Scout handshake uses the left hand, not the right. Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouts was ambidextrous but he chose the left hand because it is closer to the heart.     poll loading   Which is your dominant hand?  4000+ VOTES SO FAR   Left  Right  I'm a wizard (ambidextrous)   Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter MirrorSciTech Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletter Enter email Subscribe More On Oxford University Left Handedness   News all Most Read Most Recent Weather UK weather: Britain to be 'hotter than Greece' as temperatures soar to 25C bringing week-long sizzle The weekend marks a hike in temperatures with most parts expected to bask in some much-welcomed spring sunshine.

By Maria Konnikova August 22, 2013 Cesare Lombroso, the father of modern criminology, owes his career to a human skull. In 1871, as a young doctor at a mental asylum in Pavia, Italy, he autopsied the brain of Giuseppe Villela, a Calabrese peasant turned criminal, who has been described as an Italian Jack the Ripper. “At the sight of that skull,” Lombroso said , “I seemed to see all at once, standing out clearly illuminated as in a vast plain under a flaming sky, the problem of the nature of the criminal, who reproduces in civilised times characteristics, not only of primitive savages, but of still lower types as far back as the carnivora.” Lombroso would go on to argue that the key to understanding the essence of criminality lay in organic, physical, and constitutional features—each defect being a throwback to a more primitive and bestial psyche. And while his original insight had come from a skull, certain telltale signs, he believed, could be discerned long before an autopsy. Chief among these was left-handedness. In 1903, Lombroso summarized his views on the left-handed of the world. “What is sure,” he wrote, “is, that criminals are more often left-handed than honest men, and lunatics are more sensitively left-sided than either of the other two.” Left-handers were more than three times as common in criminal populations as they were in everyday life, he found. The prevalence among swindlers was even higher: up to thirty-three per cent were left-handed—in contrast to the four per cent Lombroso found within the normal population. He ended on a conciliatory note. “I do not dream at all of saying that all left-handed people are wicked, but that left-handedness, united to many other traits, may contribute to form one of the worst characters among the human species.” Though Lombroso’s science may seem suspect to a modern eye, less-than-favorable views of the left-handed have persisted. In 1977, the psychologist Theodore Blau argued that left-handed children were over-represented among the academically and behaviorally challenged, and were more vulnerable to mental diseases like schizophrenia. “Sinister children,” he called them. The psychologist Stanley Coren, throughout the eighties and nineties, presented evidence that the left-handed lived shorter, more impoverished lives, and that they were more likely to experience delays in mental and physical maturity, among other signs of “neurological insult or physical malfunctioning.” Toward the end of his career, the Harvard University neurologist Norman Geschwind implicated left-handedness in a range of problematic conditions, including migraines, diseases of the immune system, and learning disorders. He attributed the phenomenon, and the related susceptibilities, to higher levels of testosterone in utero, which, he argued, slowed down the development of the brain’s left hemisphere (the one responsible for the right side of the body). But over the past two decades, the data that seemed compelling have largely been discredited. In 1993 , the psychologist Marian Annett, who has spent half a century researching “handedness,” as it is known, challenged the basic foundation of Coren’s findings. The data, she argued, were fundamentally flawed: it wasn’t the case that left-handers led shorter lives. Rather, the older you were, the more likely it was that you had been forced to use your right hand as a young child. The mental-health data have also withered: a 2010 analysis of close to fifteen hundred individuals that included schizophrenic patients and their non-affected siblings found that being left-handed neither increased the risk of developing schizophrenia nor predicted any other cognitive or neural disadvantage. And when a group of neurologists scanned the brains of four hundred and sixty-five adults, they found no effect of handedness on either grey or white matter volume or concentration, either globally or regionally. Left-handers may, in fact, even derive certain cognitive benefits from their preference. This spring, a group of psychiatrists from the University of Athens invited a hundred university students and graduates—half left-handed and half right—to complete two tests of cognitive ability. In the Trail Making Test, participants had to find a path through a batch of circles as quickly as possible. In the hard version of the test, the circles contain numbers and letters, and participants must move in ascending order while alternating between the two as fast as possible. In the second test, Letter-Number Sequencing, participants hear a group of numbers and letters and must then repeat the whole group, but with numbers in ascending order and letters organized alphabetically. Lefties performed better on both the complex version of the T.M.T.—demonstrating faster and more accurate spatial skills, along with strong executive control and mental flexibility—and on the L.N.S., demonstrating enhanced working memory. And the more intensely they preferred their left hand for tasks, the stronger the effect. The Athens study points to a specific kind of cognitive benefit, since both the T.M.T. and the L.N.S. are thought to engage, to a large extent, the right hemisphere of the brain. But a growing body of research suggests another, broader benefit: a boost in a specific kind of creativity—namely, divergent thinking, or the ability to generate new ideas from a single principle quickly and effectively. In one demonstration , researchers found that the more marked the left-handed preference in a group of males, the better they were at tests of divergent thought. (The demonstration was led by the very Coren who had originally argued for the left-handers’ increased susceptibility to mental illness.) Left-handers were more adept, for instance, at combining two common objects in novel ways to form a third—for example, using a pole and a tin can to make a birdhouse. They also excelled at grouping lists of words into as many alternate categories as possible. Another recent study has demonstrated an increased cognitive flexibility among the ambidextrous and the left-handed—and lefties have been found to be over-represented among architects , musicians , and art and music students (as compared to those studying science). Part of the explanation for this creative edge may lie in the greater connectivity of the left-handed brain. In a meta-analysis of forty-three studies, the neurologist Naomi Driesen and the cognitive neuroscientist Naftali Raz concluded that the corpus callosum—the bundle of fibers that connects the brain’s hemispheres—was slightly but significantly larger in left-handers than in right-handers. The explanation could also be a much more prosaic one: in 1989, a group of Connecticut College psychologists suggested that the creativity boost was a result of the environment, since left-handers had to constantly improvise to deal with a world designed for right-handers. In a 2013 review of research into handedness and cognition, a group of psychologists found that the main predictor of cognitive performance wasn’t whether an individual was left-handed or right-handed, but rather how strongly they preferred one hand over another. Strongly handed individuals, both right and left, were at a slight disadvantage compared to those who occupied the middle ground—both the ambidextrous and the left-handed who, through years of practice, had been forced to develop their non-dominant right hand. In those less clear-cut cases, the brain’s hemispheres interacted more and overall performance improved, indicating there may something to left-handed brains being pushed in a way that a right-handed one never is. Whatever the ultimate explanation may be, the advantage appears to extend to other types of thinking, too. In a 1986 study of students who had scored in the top of their age group on either the math or the verbal sections of the S.A.T., the prevalence of left-handers among the high achievers—over fifteen per cent, as compared to the roughly ten percent found in the general population—was higher than in any comparison groups, which included their siblings and parents. Among those who had scored in the top in both the verbal and math sections, the percentage of left-handers jumped to nearly seventeen per cent, for males, and twenty per cent, for females. That advantage echoes an earlier sample of elementary-school children, which found increased left-handedness among children with I.Q. scores above a hundred and thirty-one. Lombroso’s scientific conclusions about criminal physiology may be closer to Franz Joseph Gall’s phrenology than to any modern understanding of the brain. But he might not have been so far off the mark when he hypothesized that by looking at someone’s hands, we could learn something about the inner workings of their minds—though those workings have more to do with cognitive achievement than any inclination to commit highway robbery. Michelangelo and da Vinci were left-handed, after all. As were three of the last four occupants of the White House; the only right-handed President since the end of the Cold War has been George W. Bush. Maria Konnikova  is the author of the New York Times best-seller “ Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes . ” She has a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University.

August 25, 2016 / 21 Comments / in Being Left Handed  / by Neal What percentage of people are left handed? Ever signed for a delivery and had the driver ask if you’re a lefty? Apparently we’re still that much of a rarity that people feel the need to point it out to us every time they notice. I’m not having a go, I do it myself. All the time… Last week at work the purchasing team ordered a bunch of Fender merchandise, including ( for some reason! ) this ridiculous anime lunchbox . Rather than asking why in the hell we were stocking a Fender lunchbox (like everyone else in the office), I proudly pointed out that the girl on the front was playing a left handed guitar. So apparently it’s still a novelty even to me . A guy who is left handed, plays guitar lefty, and runs a lefty guitar website … What makes for the fascination? Just how many people are left handed exactly ? Check out the handy, dandy infographic below (click to enlarge!), or keep reading to find out. What Percentage of People are Left Handed? Roughly 12% of the world is left handed. This figure is averaged from studies undertaken in North America and Western Europe. In these developed countries being left handed is less likely to be discouraged due to social stigmas, which should result in a less skewed overall number. Although it should be noted that left handed discrimination does still occur in these countries, such as this well publicised example in the USA in 2015. Right Handed (~87%) . I’m sure you didn’t come to this article unaware that right handed people make up the majority of the population. It is estimated that right handed people amount to roughly 87% of the world. Left Handed (~12%) . The second most common handedness type, studies show that on average us lefties make up around 12% of the population. Although this does vary depending on location, as in some countries being left handed may still have a social stigma attached to it. For example Taiwan (5%), Japan (4.7%), and Korea (2%) all have a much lower population of lefties. Scroll down a little further to see the lefty representation broken down by country. Ambidextrous (<1%) . An ambidextrous person is able to perform any task equally well with either hand, although they do still tend to favor their dominant side. Truly ambidextrous people are incredibly rare, and are estimated to make up less than 1% of the population. Ambivelous (<1%) . An ambivelous (or ambisinister) person is the exact opposite of an ambidextrous person, finding it generally awkward to use either hand to undertake tasks. Age is a Factor Even until recently, being left handed was still discouraged in many developed countries. We can see this when we look at the number of lefties in different age groups in North America. Only 6% of over-65s identified as being left handed, whereas a whopping 15% of under 30s said the same. Check out the graph below which shows the percentage of lefties broken down by year. These results were taken from a large study by Gilbert and Wysocki ( Hand Preference and Age in the United States , 1992) which included over 1 million people. The increased number of people identifying as being left handed is almost certainly due to modern society becoming less conservative. On top of this, it is estimated that amongst older generations some 6-8% of right handed people are actually natural left handers , but were forced into writing right handed due to social pressures. Considering the results based on age, it would seem very likely that the overall percentage of people identifying as being a lefty will continue to increase over time. How Many People Are Left Handed In Other Parts of the World? The figures above are taken from a select few countries, but what about the rest of the world? Check out the graphic below to find out! Data for European countries was taken from a large internet study by McManus and Peters ( Handedness in Europe: analysis of data from the BBC internet study ). Information on other countries was sourced from various other bodies of research. It’s clear that in countries with a more formal culture, the rate of left-handedness is much lower. It has been suggested that the more complex writing style in many Asian countries is a major reason why the numbers are so much lower. Men Versus Women Lefties are not created equally! According to a 2008 study ( Sex Differences in Left-Handedness: A Meta-Analysis of 144 Studies ), a left handed person is 23% more likely to be male than female . This means that for every 4 left handed women, there should be roughly 5 left handed men. One possible explanation for this uneven split is that girls are more likely to conform to social norms. It has also been suggested that there may be genetic factors, which you can read about below. The Chances of Having a Left Handed Child According to a 2009 study by Llaurens, Raymond and Faurie ( Why are some people left-handed? An evolutionary perspective ), the chances of having a left handed child are as follows: Both parents Left Handed – 27% Male / 21.4% Female Righty Father & Lefty Mother – 22.1% Male / 21.7% Female Lefty Father & Righty Mother – 18.2% Male / 15.3% Female Both Parents Right Handed – 10.4% Male / 8.5% Female I’ve averaged these results out for simplicity and displayed them in the graphic below. Another interesting factoid I stumbled across was that two left handed parents are twice as likely to produce twins! Is There A Place Where 100% of People Are Lefties? Yes!

Left-handers are the odd men out.  Sure, lefties make up about 10 percent of the population -- but, frankly, it seems like society has forgotten about them. Right-handed gadgets, awkwardly designed desks, cooking tools that fit comfortably in your right hand (now that’s just wrong!).

Scientists aren’t exactly sure, but research points to a complex collaboration between genes and environment. While no exact set of “leftie genes” have been discovered, people who dominantly use their left hands do have more left-handed family members. And researchers have found different brain wirings in righties vs. lefties.  But no matter what it is that drives someone to use their antipodal paw, science has also uncovered a particular set of personality traits that left-handed people tend to have. So for all of you lefties, leftie-loving righties and ambidextrous folks out there -- it’s time to brush up on your left-handed knowledge and help put an end to leftie discrimination once and for all.      PHOTO GALLERY  11 Facts About Left-Handers      Left-handers are the minority -- so does that mean they’ll go extinct one day? Nah! In fact, some researchers believe that when it comes to survival of the fittest, lefties come out on top.  Here’s why: In man-on-man combat, using the left-hand is like throwing a curveball. "The fact that left-handers are less common means they have a surprise effect," University of Montpellier researcher Charlotte Faurie told ABC News. To dig deeper, Faurie and her colleague Michel Raymond studied nine different primitive societies. In more violent societies, they found that lefties thrived (think southpaw slugger Rocky Balboa’s left hook).  Looks like the left hand has the upper hand after all.

Lefties Hear Speeches Differently  People who are using their left hands when listening may more easily hear rapidly changing sounds than those who are using their right hands, according to a study from Georgetown University Medical Center. The researchers who conducted the study, presented at Neuroscience 2012, found that the left and right hemispheres of the brain specialize in different kinds of sounds -- the left hemisphere, which controls the right hand, likes rapidly changing sounds like consonants, while the right hemisphere, which controls the left hand, likes slowly changing sounds, like syllables or intonation. According to the researchers, if you're waving an American flag while listening to a presidential candidate, the speech will sound slightly different to you depending on whether you're holding the flag in your left or right hand. The research could ultimately result in better treatment for stroke and language disorders.

She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .     Contents    1  Types  2  Causes   2.1  Division of labor  2.2  Genetic factors  2.3  Epigenetic factors  2.4  Prenatal hormone exposure  2.5  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry  2.6  Ultrasound    3  Handedness developmental timeline  4  Correlation with other factors   4.1  Intelligence   4.1.1  Early childhood intelligence    4.2  Health  4.3  Income  4.4  Left-handedness and sports  4.5  Gender  4.6  Sexuality and gender identity    5  In culture   5.1  Negative appeal  5.2  International Left-Handers Day    6  In other animals  7  See also  8  Sources  9  External links     Types [ edit ]   Right-handedness is most common. Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.  “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.  “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

For example, a cross-dominant person might write with the left hand but throw mainly with the right one. [1]  It can also refer to mixed laterality , which refers to a person favoring eyes, ears, feet, or hands on one side of the body. A person who is cross-dominant can also be stronger on the opposite side of the body that they favor; for example, a right-handed person can be stronger on the left side. Cross-dominance can often be a problem when shooting or in activities that require aim, although athletes can still achieve success in sports that require accuracy, like passing in American football and shooting in basketball. [ citation needed ]   Overall, being mixed handed seems to result in better performance than being strongly handed for sports such as basketball, ice hockey, and field hockey. What these sports have in common is that they require active body movements and also an ability to respond to either side. The situation is reversed for racquet sports such as tennis. Individuals with crossed hand-eye preference seem to be much better at gymnastics, running, and basketball because of the way in which congruent and crossed sided individuals position their bodies.  — Stanley Coren , The Left-Hander Syndrome , Chapter 3      Contents    1  In baseball  2  In tennis  3  In snooker  4  References  5  External links     In baseball [ edit ]  In baseball a left-handed batter is about two steps closer to first base than a right-handed batter, one important advantage. [2] Because curveballs and sliders – the most commonly used breaking pitches in the game – curve in the direction of a pitcher 's non-throwing hand, a batter who bats opposite the pitcher's throwing hand enjoys an advantage. Since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters enjoy a second advantage over their right-handed counterparts. [2] However, right-handed throwing is more valuable in the field. Every fielding position can be played by a right-handed thrower, although left-handers are considered more valuable pitchers and have a slight advantage at first base owing to the fact that they do not have to turn around to place their foot on first when stretching to catch a throw. Conversely, left-handed throwers are almost completely absent at the highest level at the other infield positions and at catcher . [3]  Switch hitting exists so a batter can hit from the side opposite every pitcher's throwing arm, but it has gained some criticism because a batter will always be more dominant from one side of the plate than the other; the switch hitter may be less reliable from one side. So, many baseball players are trained to be simply cross-dominant, batting solely left-handed and throwing solely right-handed. [4] There are a few position players, such as Rickey Henderson and Cleon Jones , who bat right and throw left; but this serves as a substantial disadvantage. Rickey Henderson only did that because he was taught to bat right-handed by right-handed teammates. [5]  In tennis [ edit ]  Rafael Nadal is right-hand dominant but plays tennis primarily with his left hand and a two-handed backhand, which he attributes to initially playing all shots with both hands until told he would have to choose a side for his forehand shots.  In snooker [ edit ]  In snooker , swapping the cue from one hand to the other in order to gain easy access to an oblique shot was long thought to be disrespectful, though more recently it has come to be accepted, especially since Ronnie O'Sullivan has dominated the world game and often escaped from snookers by switching to a left-handed action. [6] [ not in citation given ] There are also several players, most notably Barry Hawkins , who play with the opposite hand of their dominant one.

For specialization of brain function generally, see Functional specialization (brain) .     The human brain is divided into two hemispheres–left and right. Scientists continue to explore how some cognitive functions tend to be dominated by one side or the other; that is, how they are lateralized .    The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one hemisphere rather than the other. The medial longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres , connected by the corpus callosum . Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere. [ medical citation needed ]  Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human’s brain develops differently leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend since it has a stronger anthropological history. [1] The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. These areas frequently correspond to handedness, however, meaning that the localization of these areas is regularly found on the hemisphere corresponding to the dominant hand (anatomically on the opposite side). Function lateralization such as semantics , intonation , accentuation , prosody , etc. has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres. [2] Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum this is the same bodyside, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side .

(October 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Broca [ edit ]  One of the first indications of brain function lateralization resulted from the research of French physician Pierre Paul Broca , in 1861. His research involved the male patient nicknamed "Tan", who suffered a speech deficit ( aphasia ); "tan" was one of the few words he could articulate, hence his nickname. In Tan's autopsy , Broca determined he had a syphilitic lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere. This left frontal lobe brain area ( Broca's area ) is an important speech production region. The motor aspects of speech production deficits caused by damage to Broca’s area are known as expressive aphasia . In clinical assessment of this aphasia, it is noted that the patient cannot clearly articulate the language being employed.  Wernicke [ edit ]  German physician Karl Wernicke continued in the vein of Broca's research by studying language deficits unlike expressive aphasia. Wernicke noted that not every deficit was in speech production; some were linguistic. He found that damage to the left posterior , superior temporal  gyrus ( Wernicke's area ) caused language comprehension deficits rather than speech production deficits, a syndrome known as receptive aphasia .  Advance in imaging technique [ edit ]  These seminal works on hemispheric specialization were done on patients or postmortem brains, raising questions about the potential impact of pathology on the research findings. New methods permit the in vivo comparison of the hemispheres in healthy subjects. Particularly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are important because of their high spatial resolution and ability to image subcortical brain structures.  Movement and sensation [ edit ]  In the 1940s, neurosurgeon  Wilder Penfield and his neurologist colleague Herbert Jasper developed a technique of brain mapping to help reduce side effects caused by surgery to treat epilepsy . They stimulated motor and somatosensory cortices of the brain with small electrical currents to activate discrete brain regions. They found that stimulation of one hemisphere's motor cortex produces muscle contraction on the opposite side of the body. Furthermore, the functional map of the motor and sensory cortices is fairly consistent from person to person; Penfield and Jasper's famous pictures of the motor and sensory homunculi were the result.  Split-brain patients [ edit ]  Main article: Split-brain  Research by Michael Gazzaniga and Roger Wolcott Sperry in the 1960s on split-brain patients led to an even greater understanding of functional laterality. Split-brain patients are patients who have undergone corpus callosotomy (usually as a treatment for severe epilepsy), a severing of a large part of the corpus callosum . The corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres of the brain and allows them to communicate. When these connections are cut, the two halves of the brain have a reduced capacity to communicate with each other. This led to many interesting behavioral phenomena that allowed Gazzaniga and Sperry to study the contributions of each hemisphere to various cognitive and perceptual processes. One of their main findings was that the right hemisphere was capable of rudimentary language processing, but often has no lexical or grammatical abilities. [3] Eran Zaidel also studied such patients and found some evidence for the right hemisphere having at least some syntactic ability.  Language is primarily localized in the left hemisphere. One of the experiments carried out by Gazzaniga involved a split-brain male patient sitting in front of a computer screen while having words and images presented on either side of the screen and the visual stimuli would go to either the right or left visual field, and thus the left or right brain, respectively. It was observed that if the patient was presented with an image to his left visual field (right brain), he would report not seeing anything. If he was able to feel around for certain objects, he could accurately pick out the correct object, despite not having the ability to verbalize what he saw. This led to confirmation that the left brain is localized for language whereas the right brain does not have this capability, and when the corpus callosum is cut, the two hemispheres cannot communicate in order for situation-pertinent speech to be produced.  Pop psychology [ edit ]     The oversimplification of lateralization in pop psychology. This belief was widely held even in the scientific community for some years.    Some popularizations oversimplify the science about lateralization, by presenting the functional differences between hemispheres as being more absolute than is actually the case. [4] : 107 [5]  Sex differences [ edit ]  See also: Neuroscience of sex differences  In the 19th century and to a lesser extent the 20th, it was thought that each side of the brain was associated with a specific gender: the left corresponding with masculinity and the right with femininity and each half could function independently. [6] The right side of the brain was seen as the inferior and thought to be prominent in women, savages, children, criminals, and the insane. A prime example of this in fictional literature can be seen in Robert Louis Stevenson ’s Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . [7]  Lateralized cognitive processes [ edit ]  For example, structurally, the lateral sulcus generally is longer in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere, and functionally, Broca's area and Wernicke's area are located in the left cerebral hemisphere for about 95% of right-handers, but about 70% of left-handers. [8] : 69  Language functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in right handed individuals. [9] While language production is left-lateralized in up to 90% of right-handed subjects, it is more bilateral, or even right lateralized in approximately 50% of left-handers. [10] In contrast, prosodic language functions, such as intonation and accentuation , often are lateralized to the right hemisphere of the brain. [ medical citation needed ]  The processing of visual and auditory stimuli, spatial manipulation, facial perception , and artistic ability are represented bilaterally. [10] Numerical estimation, comparison and online calculation depend on bilateral parietal regions [11] [12] while exact calculation and fact retrieval are associated with left parietal regions, perhaps due to their ties to linguistic processing. [11] [12]  Depression is linked with a hyperactive right hemisphere, with evidence of selective involvement in "processing negative emotions, pessimistic thoughts and unconstructive thinking styles", as well as vigilance, arousal and self-reflection, and a relatively hypoactive left hemisphere, "specifically involved in processing pleasurable experiences" and "relatively more involved in decision-making processes". [13] Additionally, "left hemisphere lesions result in an omissive response bias or error pattern whereas right hemisphere lesions result in a commissive response bias or error pattern." [14] The delusional misidentification syndromes , reduplicative paramnesia and Capgras delusion are also often the result of right hemisphere lesions. [15]  Handedness and language [ edit ]  Broca's area and Wernicke's area are linked by a white matter fiber tract, the arcuate fasciculus . This axonal tract allows the neurons in the two areas to work together in creating vocal language. In more than 95% of right-handed men, and more than 90% of right-handed women, the left hemisphere is dominant in certain aspects of language and speech processing. Left-handed people may be less lateralized than right-handed people in language function. [ medical citation needed ]  Pathology [ edit ]  Hemisphere damage [ edit ]  Damage to either the right or left hemisphere, and its resulting deficits provide insight into the function of the damaged area. Right hemisphere damage has many effects on language production and perception. Damage or lesions to the right hemisphere can result in a lack of emotional prosody or intonation when speaking. Right hemisphere damage also has monumental effects on understanding discourse. People with damage to the right hemisphere have a reduced ability to generate inferences, comprehend and produce main concepts and a reduced ability to manage alternative meanings. Furthermore, when engaging in discourse people with right hemisphere damage, their discourse is often abrupt and perfunctory or verbose and excessive. They can also have pragmatic deficits in situations of turn taking, topic maintenance and shared knowledge. [ medical citation needed ]  Lateral brain damage can also have effects on spatial frequency. People with left hemisphere damage are only able to see low frequency, or big picture, parts of an image. Right hemisphere damage causes damage to low spatial frequency, so people with right hemisphere damage can only see the details of an image, or the high frequency parts of an image. [ medical citation needed ]  Plasticity [ edit ]  If a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the same hemisphere or the corresponding region in the other hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age. [16] When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies.  Broca's aphasia [ edit ]  Broca’s aphasia is a specific type of expressive aphasia and is so named due to the aphasia that results from damage or lesions to the Broca’s area of the brain, that exists most commonly in the left inferior frontal hemisphere. Thus, the aphasia that develops from the lack of functioning of the Broca’s area is an expressive and non-fluent aphasia. It is called ‘non-fluent’ due the issues that arise because Broca’s area is critical for language pronunciation and production. The area controls some motor aspects of speech production and articulation of thoughts to words and as such lesions to the area result in the specific non-fluent aphasia. [17]  Wernicke's aphasia [ edit ]  Wernicke’s aphasia is the result of damage to the area of the brain that is commonly in the left hemisphere above the sylvian fissure. Damage to this area causes primarily a deficit in language comprehension. While the ability to speak fluently with normal melodic intonation is spared, the language produced by a person with Wernicke’s aphasia is riddled with semantic errors, and may sound nonsensical to the listener. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by phonemic paraphasias, neologism or jargon. Another characteristic of a person with Wernicke’s aphasia is that they are unconcerned by the mistakes that they are making. [ medical citation needed ]  Misapplication of concept [ edit ]  Terence Hines states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research. [18] For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as EMDR and neurolinguistic programming , [19] brain-training equipment, or management training. [20]  Advantages of brain lateralization [ edit ]  The widespread lateralization of many vertebrate animals indicates an evolutionary advantage associated with the specialization of each hemisphere.

Part of this is due to design in the world which is often right-hand biased. Handwriting is one of the biggest sources of actual disadvantage for left-handed people, other than for those forced to work with certain machinery. Approximately ten percent of the world's population is left-handed, [1] yet many common articles are designed for efficient use by right-handed people, and may be inconvenient, painful, or even dangerous for left-handed people to use. These may include school desks, kitchen implements, and tools ranging from simple scissors to hazardous machinery such as power saws . [2]  Beyond being inherently disadvantaged by a right-handed bias in the design of tools, left-handed people have been subjected to deliberate discrimination and discouragement. In certain societies, they may be considered unlucky or even malicious by the right-handed majority. Many languages still contain references to left-handedness to convey awkwardness, dishonesty, stupidity, or other undesirable qualities. Even in relatively advanced societies, left-handed people were historically (and in some cases still are) forced as children to use their right hands for tasks which they would naturally perform with the left, such as eating.

Peoples of the Andes consider left-handers to possess special spiritual abilities, including magic and healing .  The Third Sapa Inca — Lloque Yupanqui —was left-handed. His name, when translated from Quechua , means "the glorified lefthander."  In the Chinese language, the character for "left", 左 , depicts a left hand attending to its work. In contrast, the character for "right", 右 ( yòu ), depicts a right hand in relation to the mouth, suggesting the act of eating.  In tantra Buddhism , the left hand represents wisdom. [4]  In early Roman times, the left side retained a positive connotation, as the Augures proceeded from the eastern side. [5] The negative meaning was subsequently borrowed into Latin from Greek, and ever since in all Roman languages.  In Russian, "levsha" (lefty, lefthander) became a common noun for skilled craftsman, after the title character from " The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea " written in 1881 by Nikolai Leskov .  Unfavorable perceptions [ edit ]  The unfavorable associations and connotations of the use of the left hand among cultures are varied. In some areas, in order to preserve cleanliness where sanitation was an issue, the right hand, as the dominant hand of most individuals, was used for eating, handling food, and social interactions. The left hand would then be used for personal hygiene, specifically after urination and defecation. These rules were imposed on all, no matter their dominant hand. Through these practices, the left hand became known as the "unclean" hand. [6] Currently, amongst Muslims and in some societies including Nepal and India it is still customary to use the left hand for cleaning oneself with water after defecating. The right hand is commonly known in contradistinction from the left, as the hand used for eating. [7] In the film Lawrence of Arabia there is no insult taken when the guide offers his food to Lawrence and he takes it to his mouth with his left hand. [8]  In many religions, including Christianity, the right hand of God is the favored hand. For example, Jesus sits at God's right side. God's left hand, however, is the hand of judgement . The Archangel Gabriel is sometimes called "God's left hand", sits at God's left side, and is one of six angels of death . Those who fall from favor with God are sent to left, as described in Matthew 25: 32–33, in which sheep represent the righteous and goats represent the fallen: "And he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on his right, but the goats on his left." In 19th-century Europe, homosexuals were referred to as "left-handed". [9] In Protestant-majority parts of the United Kingdom, Catholics were called "left-footers", and vice versa in Catholic-majority parts of Ireland and Irish America . [10]  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ", which is strongly associated with Satanism . [ citation needed ]  Various innocuous activities and experiences become rude or even signs of bad luck when the left hand becomes involved. In some parts of Scotland , it is considered bad luck to meet a left-handed person at the start of a journey. [11] In Ghana , pointing, gesturing, giving or receiving items with the left hand is considered taboo or rude. A person giving directions will put their left hand behind them and even physically strain to point with their right hand if necessary. [12] In some Asian countries, holding eating utensils in the left hand is considered impolite. [13]  Further information: Etiquette in Asia  Forced use of the right hand [ edit ]  Due to cultural and social pressures, many left-handed children were encouraged or forced to write and perform other activities with their right hands. This conversion can cause multiple problems in the developing left-handed child, including learning disorders , dyslexia , [14]  stuttering [15] [16] [17] and other speech disorders . [18] Shifts from left- to right-handed are more likely to be successful than right to left, though neither have a high success rate to begin with. Successful shifters are more likely to become ambihanded than unsuccessful ones. [19] Conversions can be successful with consistent daily practice in a variety of manual activities, but though activity in the non-dominant left-hemisphere of the brain will increase during tasks, so too will activity in the dominant right-hemisphere. Consistent left-handers have no higher activity in these task centers than converted left-handers, so it may be inferred that "attempts to switch handedness by educational training far from weakening the functional expression of lefthandedness in higher-order motor areas of the (dominant) right hemisphere in fact enhance it." [20]  Many Asian countries encourage or force their children to become right-handed due to cultural perceptions of bad luck associated with the left hand. In India and Indonesia, it is considered rude to eat with the left hand. [13] In a 2007 study in Taiwan , 59.3% of children studied had been forced to convert from left-handedness to right-handedness. The study took into account economic status of the children's families and found that children whose parents had less education were more likely to be forced to convert. Even among children whose parents had higher levels of education, the conversion rate was 45.7%. [21] Among naturally left-handed Japanese senior high school students, only 0.7% and 1.7% of individuals used their left hand for writing and eating, respectively, [22] though young Japanese are more likely to convert to using chopsticks right-handed than forks or spoons (29.3% to 4.6%). The proportion of females subjected to forced conversion is significantly higher compared to males (95.1% to 81.0%). [3]  Western countries [ which? ] have also attempted to convert left-handed children due to cultural, social and religious biases. Schools [ where? ] tend to urge children to use their right hands, sometimes against the wishes of the child's parents. In America [ when? ] some students have been physically punished for writing with their left hands (though nowadays left-handedness is more widely accepted): [13] "I was educated in the USA in Catholic school in the 60s. My left hand was beaten until it was swollen, so I would use my right right [sic] hand" ... "I had a teacher who would smack my left hand with a yardstick every time she caught me writing with my left hand" ... "My fourth grade teacher [...] would force me to use my right hand to perform all of my school work. If she caught me using my left hand, I was hit in the head with a dictionary. It turned out that she believed left handers were connected with Satan." [23]  Malawians cite their views that "the left hand is less skilled and less powerful than the right one" as main reasons for forcing left-handers to convert. Among students, teachers and parents, 75% said the left hand should not be used to perform habitual activities, and 87.6% of these believed left-handers should be forced to switch dominant hands. Parents and close relatives are most responsible for impressing these beliefs upon their children. [24]  Equipment [ edit ]     Left-handed (left) and right-handed scissors       Kitchen knives: (1) symmetrical, (2) right-handed, (3) left-handed. Cross sections seen from the handle.    Because the vast majority of the world population is right-handed, most everyday items are mass-produced for ease of use with the right hand. Tools, game equipment, musical instruments and other items must be specially ordered for left-handed use, if they are even produced and are usually more expensive than their right-handed counterparts.  Household items [ edit ]  Right-handed tools can be difficult, uncomfortable, or dangerous for left-handed people to use.  Scissors [ edit ]  For example (right-handed) scissors are arranged so that, in the right hand, fingers and thumb push the blades together laterally, creating the shearing action essential to scissors' utility. In the left hand, however, fingers and thumb tend to force right-handed blades apart, so that, rather than being sheared, the work-material is merely hacked, as by a knife, or slips between the blades uncut. [25] Left-handers using right-handed scissors will often try to compensate by forcing the handles apart laterally, causing discomfort or injury to the first knuckle of the thumb. [26]  In addition, a right-handed person using right-handed scissors can easily see the cutting line, but for a left-handed user the upper blade obscures the view. [27]  Many scissors are offered as "ambidextrous" or "suitable for right- or left-handed use." Typically, these are merely right-handed scissors with modified handles to permit use in the left hand with less discomfort, but because the blades are still arranged for right-handed use, they will not perform well in the left hand. [27]  Computer input devices [ edit ]  Input devices for computers can present obstacles to left-handed operation if intended for right-handed use. Some computer set-ups have the mouse placed on the right side of the keyboard and unable to be repositioned to the left. The mouse itself is also sometimes shaped to fit the right hand better. The functions of mouse buttons, even on mice shaped to fit both hands, default to right-hand use. On two-button mice, the left button —under the index finger of a right-handed person— is the primary button, while the right button performs secondary functions. The on-screen pointers themselves are also configured for right-handed people. Most desktop operating systems allow a user to reverse the functionality of mouse buttons to accommodate left-handed use, but left-handed cursors sometimes need to be specially downloaded. [28]  Trackballs and trackpads are often shaped for right-handed use. Even with the ability to change the functionality of buttons, these devices may be difficult for left-handed use. For a left handed person there are computer mice designed for left handed use, but they are a much smaller segment of the marketplace. [29]  Video game controllers often have the action buttons on the right with the directional controls on the left. In first-person shooters, many games default to the right pointer-finger being used to fire, simulating a right-handed person pulling the trigger of the weapon. Certain systems' layouts, such as Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS, have games in which right-handed stylus use is assumed and can cause difficulty for left-handed players. [30]     A right-handed trackball is difficult to use with the left hand.    Knives [ edit ]  While European-style kitchen knives are usually symmetrical, Japanese kitchen knives have the cutting edge ground asymmetrically, having the cutting edge closer to the user's body [ citation needed ] with ratios [ clarification needed ] ranging from 70–30 for the average chef's knife, to 90–10 for professional sushi chef knives; left-handed models are rare, and usually must be specially ordered or custom made. [31] On the other hand, the majority of "flat ground" general-purpose knives typically have the cutting edge on the right, as with a left-handed knife, for aesthetic reasons rather than practical. [ citation needed ]  Cameras [ edit ]  One of the few cameras ever produced for left-handers was the half-frame Yashica Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds. [ citation needed ]  Musical instruments [ edit ]  Left-handed adaptations have even bridged the world of music. Left-handed string instruments are produced, including guitars and violins .Inverted trumpets are made, too. Although the trumpet's valves are normally designed to be operated with the right hand, the prevailing belief is that left-handed trumpeters are not at a significant disadvantage. The French horn , for example, is played with the left hand, yet most horn players are right-handed. Left handed drummers also set up drum kits the exact opposite to conventional right-handed setup (i.e. hi-hat on the right, bass pedal under left foot, ride cymbal to the drummer's left, etc.).  Sports [ edit ]  A left-handed individual may be known as a southpaw, particularly in a sports context. It is widely accepted that the term originated in the United States, in the game of baseball . [32]  Ballparks are often designed so that batters are facing east, so that the afternoon or evening sun does not shine in their eyes. [33] This means that left-handed pitchers are throwing with their south-side arm. [34] The Oxford English Dictionary lists a non-baseball citation for "south paw", meaning a punch with the left hand, as early as 1848, [35] just three years after the first organized baseball game, with the note "(orig. U.S., in Baseball)." [36] A left-handed advantage in sports can be significant and even decisive, but this advantage usually results from a left-handed competitor's unshared familiarity with opposite-handed opponents. Baseball is an exception since batters, pitchers, and fielders in certain scenarios are physically advantaged or disadvantaged by their handedness.  In baseball, due to the direction in which curveballs and sliders break, it is generally accepted that the pitcher has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. For this reason, many baseball teams include a left-handed specialist pitcher, who is brought into the game specifically to pitch to dangerous left-handed batters in crucial situations. A left-handed first baseman uses a more fluid motion to tag out a baserunner returning to first base during a pickoff attempt by the pitcher and has less difficulty avoiding baserunners while presenting their mitt as a target for other fielders to throw to. It is very uncommon to see a left-handed player playing any infield position other than pitcher or first basemen due to the counterclockwise flow of the game when throwing the ball around the bases. A fielder's handedness is either a physical advantage or hindrance for similar reasons throughout the infield positions, and left-handedness is not always the more desirable dexterousness.  Left-handed bowlers are usually at an advantage during ten-pin bowling competition when hooking the ball into the pins from the left side of the lane. As there are fewer left-handed players, the lane's left side is not used as much, and thus the applied oil pattern does not change as quickly as it does for right-handed bowlers.  In boxing , someone who boxes left-handed is frequently referred to as southpaw. The term is also used to refer to a stance in which the boxer places the right foot in front of the left, so it is possible for a right-handed boxer to box with a southpaw stance . Most boxers, southpaw or otherwise, tend to train with sparring partners who adopt an orthodox stance which gives southpaws an advantage. Manny Pacquiao is an example of a southpaw (although he writes with his right hand). In the popular boxing film series Rocky , the main character Rocky Balboa is a southpaw. Southpaw is also a term in professional wrestling, often giving them the advantage.  Fencing weapons feature left- and right-handed grips, and a left-handed fencer's stance is opposite that of a right-handed opponent. Though commonly asserted that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed opponents because the line of defence favors their sword arm, this assertion describes both fencers in a mixed-handed duel, so neither competitor has a unique physical advantage. Thus the left-hander's advantage in fencing stems mostly from a right-hander's unfamiliarity with a left-handed stance.  The game of golf is most commonly played right-handed, and left-handed players typically must provide their own special golf clubs . [11] The game can be played with both hands, provided the player has both left- and right-handed clubs, giving an advantage over one-handed players. Professional golfer Phil Mickelson plays left-handed though he is naturally right-handed. [37]  In tennis, southpaws hold the racket in their left hand. Because of this, their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right-handed players. Some world champion left-handed tennis players include Jimmy Connors , Guillermo Vilas , John McEnroe , Martina Navratilova , Marcelo Ríos , Goran Ivanišević and Rafael Nadal .  Weapons [ edit ]     A US Navy SEALs left-handed shooter    The vast majority of firearms are designed for right-handed shooters, with the operating handle, magazine release, or safety mechanisms set up for manipulation by the right hand, and fired cartridge cases ejected to the right. Also, scopes and sights may be mounted in such a way as to require the shooter to place the rifle against the right shoulder. A left-handed shooter must either purchase a left-handed or ambidextrous firearm (which are manufactured in smaller numbers and are generally more expensive and/or harder to obtain), shoot a right-handed gun left-handed (which presents certain difficulties, such as the controls being improperly located for the left hand or hot shell cases being ejected towards the shooter's body, especially the eyes or down the collar or right sleeve), or learn to shoot right-handed (which may be less comfortable or "natural"). A related issue is ocular dominance , due to which left-handed people may wish to shoot right-handed, and vice versa. Ocular dominance plays more of a rule in shooting accuracy than does left versus right handiness. Therefore, ocular dominance will cause a preference on how a shooter chooses to hold a gun.  Some modern firearms are ambidextrous (e.g. the FN P90 and Heckler & Koch P7 ), or can be converted between right- and left-handed operation (e.g. the Heckler & Koch G36 and Steyr AUG ). Bullpup rifles are particularly problematic for left-handers unless they can be reconfigured, since empty shells would be ejected straight into the shooter's face and cheek potentially causing injury, or otherwise designed from the ground up for ambidextrous use, often by way of complex ejection systems as seen on the FN F2000 and the Kel-Tec RFB . The British L85 Assault Rifle must be fired right-handed, placing left-handed soldiers at a disadvantage. In contrast, the Steyr AUG is of a modular design and the ejection port and extractor can be switched/replaced to suit the handedness of the soldier operating it. The M-16 and its variants have a fixed ejection port, but being a conventional (i.e. not bullpup) design the ejection port is forward of the operator and hence able to be fired either-handed. Circa 1985, with the introduction of the M16A2 version, a case deflector was incorporated adjacent to the ejector port to direct discarded shells in a more forward direction, making the rifle even more left hand operator friendly. The deflector is not always effective, however, as the ejected shell still stands a chance of hitting the left-handed shooter's cheek, especially in windy conditions.  Lever action and pump action firearms present fewer difficulties for left-handers than bolt action weapons do. Many weapons with adjustable sights allow for left-handed use, but for a right eye dominant shooter it is necessary to adjust. In fact, most weapons adjust well enough that a weapon will not eject shells into a left-hander's eye.  Machinery [ edit ]  Power tools , machinery and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common problems faced by left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations. [2]  Table saws , whose blades protrude from the top of a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On bandsaws , the blade teeth are on the left side of the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand.  Handheld circular saws are made almost exclusively for right-handers, with the motor and grip on the right side. If held in the left hand, it is impossible for the operator to see what they are cutting. Tool manufacturer Porter-Cable produces a left-handed circular saw that can be purchased relatively inexpensively. [2]               Left-handed Remington 700 rifle action—note that the bolt handle is not visible from this side               A table saw . Notice how the cutting surface, fence, etc. are on the right side        Language [ edit ]  Historically, the left side, and subsequently left-handedness, was considered negative. The word "left" itself derives from the Anglo-Saxon word lyft , "weak". [38] In Ancient Greek both words meaning "left" were euphemisms : the word ἀριστερός , aristerós (the standard word in Modern Greek as well) is derived from ἂριστος, áristos , "best", and the word εὺώνυμος , euōnymos , "of good name", is another euphemism used in lieu of "ill-named". The Latin adjective sinister/sinistra/sinistrum originally meant "left" but took on meanings of "evil" or "unlucky" by the Classical Latin era, and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin , and in the English word "sinister". Alternatively, sinister comes from the Latin word sinus meaning "pocket": a traditional Roman toga had only one pocket, located on the left side. The right hand has historically been associated with skill: the Latin word for right-handed is dexter , as in "dexterity", meaning manual skill. Even the word " ambidexterity " reflects the bias . Its intended meaning is "skillful on both sides". However, since it keeps the Latin root dexter , which means "right", it ends up conveying the idea of being "right-handed on both sides". This bias is also apparent in the lesser-known antonym "ambisinistrous", which means "left-handed [ i.e. , clumsy] on both sides". [39] In more technical contexts, "sinistral" may be used in place of "left-handed" and "sinistrality" in place of "left-handedness". [40] In both Ancient Greek and Roman religion , auspices (usually the flight paths of birds, as observed by a bird-diviner, or augur ) were thought to be unfavorable if appearing on the diviner's left-hand side and favorable if on the right: an ancient custom mentioned in Homer 's Iliad and of apparently Middle Eastern origin (as attested in the Amarna correspondence , in which a king of Alashiya , i.e. Cyprus , requests an eagle-diviner from the Pharaoh of Egypt).  Meanings gradually developed from use of these terms in the ancient languages. In many modern European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper", and also stands for authority and justice.  In Sanskrit, the word "वाम" (waama) stands for both "left" and "wicked."  In most Slavic languages the root prav (right) is used in words carrying meanings of correctness or justice. In colloquial Russian the word левый (levyĭ) "left" means unofficial, counterfeit, strange. In Polish, the word prawo means "right" as well as "law", prawy means: lawful; the word lewy means "left" (opposite of right), and colloquially "illegal" (opposite of legal).  In French, droit(e) ( cognate to English direct ) means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right", while gauche means "left" and is also a synonym of maladroit , literally "not right", meaning "clumsy". Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German have similar constructs. The Spanish term diestro and the Italian term destro mean both "right-handed" and "skillful". The contemporary Italian word sinistra has both meanings of sinister and left (the masculine adjective for sinister being sinistro ), and maldestro means "clumsy". The Spanish siniestra has both, too, although the "left" meaning is less common and is usually expressed by izquierda , [41] a Basque word that made its way into Portuguese as well. In some Spanish-speaking countries, to do something por izquierda means to engage in corrupt conduct or employ illegitimate means, whereas por derecha or a derechas means to do it the right (legitimate) way. [42] Also, in Spanish, to tell someone "Eres tan zurdo" means that they are being clumsy, though the literal meaning is "You're so lefty." In Portuguese, the most common word for left-handed person, canhoto , was once used to identify the devil , and canhestro , a related word, means "clumsy".  In Romanian drept/dreaptă (coming from Latin directus ) means both "right" and "straight". The word for "left" is stâng/stângă coming from Latin stancus (= stanticus ) meaning "tired". [43]  In German, recht means "right" in both the adjectival sense (correct) and the nominal (legal entitlement). The word for "left" is links , and is closely related to both link (underhand, questionable), and linkisch (clumsy). [44] [45]  The Dutch words for "left" ( links, linker ) and "right" ( recht, rechts, rechter ) have much the same meanings and connotations as in English. The adjective link means "cunning, shifty" or "risky". A linkerd is a "crafty devil". To look at someone over the left shoulder ( iemand over de linkerschouder aanzien ) is to regard him or her as insignificant. [46]  In Irish, deas means "right side" and "nice". Ciotóg is the left hand and is related to ciotach meaning "awkward"; [47]  ciotógach (kyut-OH-goch) is the term for left-handed. In Welsh, the word chwith means "left", but can also mean "strange", "awkward", or "wrong". The Scots term for left-handedness is corrie fistit . The term can be used to convey clumsiness.  In Finnish, the word oikea means both "right" (okay, correct) and "right" (the opposite of left).  In Swedish, att göra något med vänsterhanden (literally "to do something with your left hand") means "to do something badly". In Swedish, vänster means "left". The term vänsterprassel means "infidelity", "adultery" and "cheating". From this term the verb vänstra (lit. "lefting") is derived.  In Hungarian, the word for right is jobb , which also means "better". The word for left is bal , which also means "bad". In Estonian, the word pahem stands for both "left" and "worse" and the word parem stands for both "right" and "better".  In Turkish, the word for right is sağ , which means "alive". The word for left is sol , which means "discolor", "die", "ill".  In Chinese culture, the adjective "left" ( Chinese character : 左 , Mandarin : zuǒ ) sometimes means "improper" or "out of accord". For instance, the phrase "left path" ( 左 道 , zuǒdào ) stands for unorthodox or immoral means.  In Korean, the word for right is oreun (오른), to be compared to the word meaning morally proper, orheun (옳은) which shares the same pronunciation. [48]  In Hebrew, as well as in other ancient Semitic and Mesopotamian languages, the term "left" was a symbol of power or custody. [49] There were also examples of left-handed assassins in the Old Testament (Ehud killing the Moabite king). The left hand symbolized the power to shame society, and was used as a metaphor for misfortune, natural evil , or punishment from the gods. This metaphor survived ancient culture and was integrated into mainstream Christianity by early Catholic theologians , such as Ambrose of Milan , [50] to modern Protestant theologians, such as Karl Barth , [51] to attribute natural evil to God in explaining God's omnipotence over the universe.

The Spanish expression " tener dos pies izquierdos ", in English, the expression "to have two left feet", refers to clumsiness in the domains of football or dancing. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. The Polish expression " mieć dwie lewe ręce ", Dutch " twee linkerhanden hebben ", German " zwei linke Hände haben ", the Bulgarian expression " dve levi ratse ", French " avoir deux mains gauches ", Hungarian kétbalkezes and Czech " Mít obě ruce levé " all mean "to have two left hands"—that one is clumsy or is a very poor handyman; the English equivalent is "to be all thumbs". Moreover, the German idiom " mit dem linken Fuß aufgestanden sein ", the Spanish expression " levantarse con el pie izquierdo ", the French expression " s'être levé du pied gauche " and the Hungarian expression " bal lábbal kelt fel " (literally, to get up with the left foot) mean to have a bad day and do everything wrong or unsuccessfully, related to the English expression "to get up on the wrong side of the bed". The Welsh phrase " tu chwith allan " (left side out) refers to an object being inside-out. [52] In Russian, the use of the term nalyevo means "on the left", but can also connote taking bribes or "sneaky" behavior. Balszerencse (lit. "left luck") is Hungarian for "bad luck".  There are many colloquial terms used to refer to a left-handed person, e.g. "southpaw" (USA). Some are just slang or jargon words, while other references may be offensive or demeaning, either in context or in origin. In some parts of the English-speaking world, "cack-handed" is slang for left-handed, and is also used to mean clumsy. The origin of this term is disputed, but some suggest it is derived from the Latin cacare , in reference to the habit of performing ablutions with the left hand, leaving the right hand "clean". [53] [54] However, other sources suggest that it is derived from the Old Norse word keikr , meaning "bent backwards". [55] Australians frequently use "cacky-handed". A less common Australian slang word for a left-handed individual is the term Molly-Dooker , whose origins cannot be determined with certainty. [56]  Handwriting [ edit ]  Left-handed people who speak Arabic , Persian , Urdu , Hebrew or any other right-to-left script do not have the same difficulties with writing. The right-to-left nature of these languages prevents left-handers from running their hand on the ink as happens with left-to-right languages. Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, it is considered easier to write the Latin alphabet with the right hand than with the left. Furthermore, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the person in question. [57]  Left-to-right alphabets can be written smudge-free and in proper "forward slant" with the left hand if the paper is turned 1/4 turn clockwise (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do calligraphy in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs. Otherwise, left-handed pen nibs are required in order to get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed pen nibs are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th-century copperplate hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point.  Civic life [ edit ]  Schooling [ edit ]  As the majority of students in public schools are right-handed, most commonly used implements are designed for the right-handed, from pencil sharpeners to scissors to desks . The consequences to left-handed students can vary from decreased academic performance or physical ailments to nothing at all. [58]  In many classrooms and lecture halls , desks are designed so that the writing surface is attached to the chair instead of separate from it. In this design, the desk is attached on the right side, offering an armrest for right-handed people to use while writing. In some of these desks, the writing surface does not extend fully to the left, necessitating a left-handed user to turn their body in order to write properly, sometimes causing back, neck and shoulder problems. [58] [59] This contorted posture may also cause the student to be accused of cheating . [60] In some cases, however, large lecture halls will use left-handed desks on the left-most column of each section so that left-handed people can comfortably write without bumping against a neighbor.  This right-handed bias is reflected in standardized tests as well. Multiple-choice tests tend to put the question on the left side of the page and the answers on the right side. If the answers must be filled in in a separate booklet, it can be awkward and uncomfortable for a left-handed student to line up the booklet with the answers. The time it takes to find a comfortable, convenient position cuts into test-taking time, resulting in rushed answers and unchecked work. [58] [59]  In Vietnam , schools officially require students to write with their right hands, and some teachers of Grade 1 (when writing is taught) would implement that rule by deducting points from tests written by the left hand. The Civic Education textbook for grade 7 mentions a student thanking her old teacher for helping her write with her right hand, and stopping her from using her left hand to write.  Employment [ edit ]  In research done on the relations of handedness and employment, researchers may start their experiments believing left-handers earn lower wages than their right-handed counterparts, due to effects like difficulty using right-handed tools and increased rate of illness among left-handed people. [61] [ not in citation given ] However, their findings are more complex. In studies in the United States and United Kingdom, it was found that left-handed men earn more than right-handed men; about 5% more in the UK. Conversely, left-handed women earn about 7.5% less than right-handed women.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.  “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.  “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

Measuring Handedness  Handedness Statistics  Handedness and the Brain  Theories of Handedness ‣  Other Handedness Issues ‣  History of Handedness ‣  Famous Left-Handers ‣  A Few Final Thoughts  Sources      E-mail: lukem@lukemastin.com  Web-site designed by: Luke Mastin     Tweet           Handedness Statistics          Estimates for the prevalence of left-handedness vary significantly - anywhere between 2% and 30% - reflecting the ambiguities and inconsistencies inherent in the defining handedness (see the section on Measuring Handedness ), but also sometimes the biases and unreliability of the sources. Best estimates for left-handedness in the relatively permissive cultures of the developed Western world (roughly North America and Western Europe) is around 12% . In more formal cultures that stress conformity, such as Asian, Muslim and Latin American countries , the rates tend to be much lower . For example, Korea (2%), Japan (3%) and Taiwan (5%) have the lowest levels of left-handedness, possibly reflecting the systematic discouragement of left-handedness that still persists in these countries. The difficulty of teaching complex Chinese and Japanese calligraphy has been suggested as another reason why children there are more likely to adopt the same handedness as their teachers. Overall, worldwide , a rough figure of about 10% seems likely. However, it could be argued that the statistics from more permissive and less conformist societies like North America may in fact give a “truer” and less distorted indication of the relative numbers of left-handedness, as they are less influenced by extraneous social and political factors . Indeed, it is perhaps a testament to the tenacity and persistence of left-handedness that there are still any left-handers at all in Eastern cultures like Korea and Japan. Demographic Variations Within the 12% of North Americans who claim left-handedness, there are some interesting demographic variations. As regards gender , men are slightly more likely than women to be left-handed, with most studies indicating that about 13% of men and just under 11% of women are left-handed (men are NOT twice as likely to be left-handed as is sometimes claimed). It has been suggested this occurs because girls are more receptive to social mores and more likely to conform than boys (although there may also be a genetic component ). In the same way, the percentage of left-handers tends to be much smaller than the overall average among Chinese Americans , those who attended Catholic schools , and older generations raised in the more conformist Pre-War years. The variations due to age demographics are particularly striking, with one major study indicating that about 15% of under-30s are left-handed writers, compared to only 6% of over-65s . Other statistics back up this trend: a century ago , only about 2-3% of North Americans were, or at least admitted to being, left-handed, compared to around 12% today. An analysis of the underlying trends shows a steady increase in left-handedness from the beginning of the 20th Century until about the middle of the century, after which it stabilizes at about 12%. This is unlikely to be due to any genetic factors, and probably reflects the changing attitudes towards left-handedness (a relaxation of the stigma and social pressure against it) and the educational reforms against systematic switching during education. By some estimates, 6-8% of right-handed Americans, particularly among older generations, are actually natural left-handers who have been forced (or at least encouraged) to switch at a young age, with an unknown number of others having switched before their memories reliably begin. Interestingly, left-handedness is almost twice as likely among twins as among the general population. Left-handed parents are also about twice as likely to produce twin offspring. And finally, left-handers are about twice as likely to have left-handed children as right-handers. These statistics suggest intuitively that there is some sort of link between twins and handedness, but just what that link might be has been perplexingly resistant to discovery. There are, of course, also major inconsistencies between the two phenomena of left-handedness and twins, not the least of which being that monozygotic (or "identical") twins occur only 3 or 4 times out of every 1,000 births (as compared to over 100 in every 1,000 for left-handedness). In past times (and presumably in some countries even today), it seems possible that the long-standing prejudice against left-handedness could even have interfered with the mating prospects of left-handers. A 1992 meta-study by Chris MacManus and Phil Bryden showed that, prior to 1955, two right-handed parents averaged 3.1 children, a right-handed and a left-handed parent averaged 2.69 children, and two left-handers just 2.32. Interestingly, since 1955, this situation has actually completely reversed , suggesting that left-handers are now in the ascendancy, although the implications of this in the longer term are not clear. Mixed-Handedness         Some estimates claim that as many as 30% within the developed world may be classified as “non-right-handed” , a much broader category which includes mixed-handed and ambidextrous individuals, although the limitations of testing techniques and of the definition of parameters make such sweeping claims difficult to justify (see the section on Measuring Handedness ). Most people fall towards the extremes of the left-right continuum of handedness, with over 60% strongly or completely right-handed and another 20% or more quite strongly right-handed. Very few are strongly or completely left-handed (less than 3%), and even fewer are evenly mixed-handed or ambidextrous. The resulting graph of handedness is sometimes described as “J-shaped” , with a small uptick for strong left-handedness, a big dip in the middle and a steeply-rising and much larger uptick towards strong right-handedness. In some respects, mixed-handedness is more prevalent towards the left hand side of the scale than the right. Another way of looking at this is that left-handedness is more likely to be a weak handeness preference , whereas right-handedness is more likely to be a strong  preference . For example, about half of all left-handers (who write with their left hands) prefer to throw a ball with their right hands, and actually do so more accurately than with their left. Conversely, only about 2% of right-handed writers prefer to throw left. Other Aspects of Laterality Other studies have attempted to estimate other aspects of laterality. Around 80% favour their right foot , 70% their right eye , and 60% their right ear . Sidedness in other parts of the body, though, is not necessarily consistent with a person's handedness: for example, around 40% of left-handers are right-eye dominant, and almost 50% are right-footed. However, we should perhaps expect handedness and “eyedness” to be independent of each other, as there is no real direct analogy between the two phenomena (both hemispheres of the brain control both eyes, with each hemisphere processing a different half of the retina of each eye). Also, foot use does not require anything like the same level of motor control as hand use. Other (less important but nonetheless interesting aspects) of laterality include hand-clasping and arm-folding. Hand-clasping can be demonstrated by quickly clasping your hands together, interlacing the fingers in what feels like the most natural way. About 60% of people, regardless of whether they are left-handed or right-handed, clasp their hands with the left thumb on top. Arm-folding also shows evidence of a type of handedness: when you fold your arms naturally, take note of which wrist is on top . Again, about 60% fold their arms with the left wrist on top (and indeed find it quite difficult to do otherwise), and once again, it appears to be totally independent of either a person’s handedness or their hand-clasping preference. The direction of the hair whorl on the crown of the head is another example of laterality, with about three-quarters of people having a clockwise whorl (causing a tendency for the hair to naturally part on the left), and a quarter anti-clockwise (although different studies have yielded results anywhere from 65% to 92%). Research by Amar Klar indicates that about 45% of left-handers have anti-clockwise hair whorls, compared to only about 8% of right-handers, suggesting a possible genetic link between the two phenomena, but it is by no means a simple link.

Left-handers are the odd men out.  Sure, lefties make up about 10 percent of the population -- but, frankly, it seems like society has forgotten about them. Right-handed gadgets, awkwardly designed desks, cooking tools that fit comfortably in your right hand (now that’s just wrong!).  More From Everyday Health:  10 Tips To Improve Your Memory  Unraveling The Meaning Of Dreams  8 Fascinating Pain Facts You Didn't Know  What causes someone to become a southpaw? Scientists aren’t exactly sure, but research points to a complex collaboration between genes and environment. While no exact set of “leftie genes” have been discovered, people who dominantly use their left hands do have more left-handed family members. And researchers have found different brain wirings in righties vs. lefties.  But no matter what it is that drives someone to use their antipodal paw, science has also uncovered a particular set of personality traits that left-handed people tend to have. So for all of you lefties, leftie-loving righties and ambidextrous folks out there -- it’s time to brush up on your left-handed knowledge and help put an end to leftie discrimination once and for all.      PHOTO GALLERY  11 Facts About Left-Handers      Left-handers are the minority -- so does that mean they’ll go extinct one day? Nah! In fact, some researchers believe that when it comes to survival of the fittest, lefties come out on top.  Here’s why: In man-on-man combat, using the left-hand is like throwing a curveball. "The fact that left-handers are less common means they have a surprise effect," University of Montpellier researcher Charlotte Faurie told ABC News. To dig deeper, Faurie and her colleague Michel Raymond studied nine different primitive societies. In more violent societies, they found that lefties thrived (think southpaw slugger Rocky Balboa’s left hook).  Looks like the left hand has the upper hand after all.

Lefties Hear Speeches Differently  People who are using their left hands when listening may more easily hear rapidly changing sounds than those who are using their right hands, according to a study from Georgetown University Medical Center. The researchers who conducted the study, presented at Neuroscience 2012, found that the left and right hemispheres of the brain specialize in different kinds of sounds -- the left hemisphere, which controls the right hand, likes rapidly changing sounds like consonants, while the right hemisphere, which controls the left hand, likes slowly changing sounds, like syllables or intonation. According to the researchers, if you're waving an American flag while listening to a presidential candidate, the speech will sound slightly different to you depending on whether you're holding the flag in your left or right hand. The research could ultimately result in better treatment for stroke and language disorders.

"If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

This article was written by Keith Milsom, owner of Anything Left-Handed, in response to lots of questions from Left Handers Club members.  About 10% of the world's population are left-handed and it seems that left-handedness runs in families, with the handedness of the mother being an important factor.  So what are the chances of having a left-handed child?  Various studies have shown that around 10% of the world's population are naturally left-handed and that this seems to be a fairly consistent figure over a long period of time and in all countries and cultures.  The way left-handedness is measured and the fact that many cultures deliberately suppress left-handedness complicate the picture, but left-handedness seems to stay at about that level anyway.  More recent studies among children show a higher level,  may be increasing.  It also seems to run in families, although no gene for left-handedness has been isolated and it is not possible to predict left-handedness in the same way as, say, eye colour. What we do know is that the more left-handers you have in the family, the more chance of having left-handed children.  The probabilities of various left-right parent combinations having a left-handed child vary quite a lot depending on which research you look at.  Dr Chris McManus reported in his book Left Hand, Right Hand on a study he had done based on a review of scientific literature which showed parent handedness for 70,000 children.  On average, the chances of two right-handed parents having a left-handed child were around 9% left-handed children, two left-handed parents around 26% and one left and one right-handed parent around 19%.  In The Left-Handers Handbook, Diane Paul, repeated this and also noted that Left-handed mothers are more likely to have left-handed children than left-handed fathers.  This was based on research done by Stanley Coren for his book The Left Hander Syndrome, where he showed the chances of  two right-handed parents having a left-handed child were around 10%, a right-handed mother and left-handed father the same, 10%, left-handed mother and right-handed father 20% and two left-handed parents 35%.  A large survey carried out by Anything Left-Handed showed that only 1.4% of left-handers who responded had two left-handed parent, 24% had one left-handed parent and 75% had two right-handed parents.  Are all these numbers consistent with each other?  If those percentages are true, would the level of left-handedness in the population as a whole stay at a consistent level?  I have produced a model that calculates the mix of handedness in parents and then multiples by the assumed probabilities for each mix having left-handed children to calculate the total number of left-handed children and their percentage of the population.  For example, if 10% of the population is left-handed, only 1% of all couples will be made up of two left-handers (like me an my wife, but there is a theory that left-handers attract each other which would distort this, but that is for another article!).  Putting Chris McManus's percentages into the model shows an increase from 10% to 11.5% in the level of left-handedness in the population in one generation and if that continued for very long left-handers would no longer be in the minority!  Stanley Coren's figures, although quite different, also give an increase in left-handedness to 11.2% and neither of them give a match to the figures from the Anything Left-Handed survey.  Most significantly, the number of left-handed children with two left-handed parents is 2.3% for McManus and 3.1% for Coren.  To get down to the level of only 1.4% found in the Anything Left-Handed survey, the chances of two left-handed parents having a left-handed child need to be reduced to around 14% - much closer to the other parent mixes.  Juggling the figures to get the best match to all these results, plus also keeping the level of left-handedness stable at around 10%, these probabilities of having a left-handed child seem to fit:  Two right handed parents, 9% Left handed father, 12% Left handed mother, 16% Two left handed parents, 20%  There are many more variables that affect these figures and one study showed that left-handers have less children on average that right handers. This is meant to be a guide rather than a scientific conclusion.  However, whichever set of assumptions you use, some interesting figures come out:  *  More than 50% of left-handers do not know of any other left-hander anywhere in their living family.  *  Around 75% of left-handers have two right-handed parents and only 2% have two left-handed parents.  *  Between 7 and 8 out of 10 children born to two left handed parent will be right handed.  Of course, the chances of having a left-hander in the family increase the more children you have.  So there is still hope for right-handed parents - if you have enough children, you may still be lucky enough to have a left-hander!

Left-handers are the odd ones out. Sure, lefties make up about 10 percent of the population — but, frankly, it seems like society has forgotten about them. Just consider all of the right-handed gadgets, awkwardly designed desks, and cooking tools that fit comfortably only in your right hand. What causes someone to become a southpaw? Scientists aren’t exactly sure, but research points to a complex collaboration between genes and environment. While no exact set of “leftie genes” have been discovered, people who dominantly use their left hands do have more left-handed family members. And researchers have found different brain wirings in righties vs. lefties. But no matter what it is that drives someone to use their antipodal paw, science has also uncovered a particular set of personality traits that left-handed people tend to have. So for all of you lefties, leftie-loving righties, and ambidextrous folks out there — it’s time to brush up on your left-handed knowledge and help put an end to leftie discrimination once and for all.   Lefties Have a Higher Risk of Psychosis Lefties make up about 10 percent of the general population. But researchers have found that in populations with certain mental disorders, that rate goes up. Previous studies have found that people with psychosis had a 20 percent likelihood of being left-handed, though a small study in the journal SAGE found the rate of psychotic lefties may be even higher. Researchers at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas assessed 107 patients at outpatient psychiatric clinics. For those with mood disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder , the rate of left-handedness was close to average, at 11 percent. But in people with psychosis, such as those with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the rate of left-handedness was 40 percent, well above average. Researchers theorize brain laterality plays a role.   Your Handedness May Determine Your Health Scientists have also found an increased risk for dyslexia, ADHD , and certain mood disorders in left-handed people, according to a 2010 study published in Pediatrics. Researchers are not exactly sure how to explain this phenomenon, but many believe it's related to how the brain is wired. Your noggin is divided into two halves: the left side and the right side. Most people (righties and lefties alike) rely on the brain's left hemisphere for tasks like language functioning. But about 30 percent of left-handed folks are either partial to the right hemisphere or have no dominant hemisphere at all. According to scientists, having one hemisphere dominate is much more efficient, which is why some left-handers are at increased risk for learning impairments and brain disorders. But lefties may be in luck when it comes to other health conditions: Results of a large survey published in the journal Laterality found that left-handers had lower rates of arthritis and ulcers.   Lefties Hear Speeches Differently People who use their left hands when listening may more easily hear slowly-changing sounds than those who use their right hands, according to a study from Georgetown University Medical Center. The researchers who conducted the study, presented at Neuroscience 2012, found that the left and right hemispheres of the brain specialize in different kinds of sounds. The left hemisphere, which controls the right hand, likes rapidly-changing sounds like consonants, while the right hemisphere, which controls the left hand, likes slowly-changing sounds like syllables or intonation. According to the researchers, if you're waving an American flag while listening to a presidential candidate, the speech will sound slightly different to you depending on whether you're holding the flag in your left or right hand. The research could ultimately result in better treatment for stroke and language disorders. Update: An earlier version of this post stated that people who use their left hands may more easily hear rapidly-changing sounds that those who use their right hands. In fact, left-handers hear slow-changing sounds better.   Left-Handed Neanderthals Were the Minority, Too Right-handed bias isn’t just a modern-day phenomenon: It turns out we’ve been dominantly using our right hooks for more than 500,000 years. University of Kansas researchers recently determined the handedness of ancient humans by studying — oddly enough — their teeth. The study, which was published in the journal Laterality, found that when our great-great-great-great-(you get the point)-grandfathers processed animal hides, they would hold one side of the carcass in one hand and the other in their mouth. By locating the wear and tear on those prehistoric chompers, scientists were able to determine whether our prehistoric ancestors were using their left hand or right hand more dominantly "All you need to have is a single tooth, and you can tell if our assumptions are right — if the individual is right- or left-handed," study researcher David Frayer, Ph.D., told LiveScience . The results? "The fossils are just like humans in that we are mostly right-handed, and so were they."   Lefties Make Better Artists Southpaws have been bragging about their creative clout for years. But is it true — does being left-handed mean you’re also more likely to be artistic or innovative? According to research published in the American Journal of Psychology , there is some evidence that left-handed people have the upper hand in at least one creative facet: They’re better at divergent thinking, a method of idea generation that explores many possible solutions. To determine whether lefties were more likely to pursue creative careers than righties, the folks behind the Left-Handers Club (a pro-leftie group dedicated to left-handed research and product development) surveyed more than 2,000 left-handed, right-handed, and ambidextrous participants and found that lefties tended to find advantages and be drawn to careers in the arts, music, sports, and information-technology fields. But that may also add up to lower paychecks: According to a report in the Wall Street Journal , left-handers’ salaries are 10 percent lower on average than those of right-handers. AFP/Getty Images  We Vote for Left-Handers! It doesn’t matter which way they swing politically: A surprisingly high percentage of recent U.S. presidents were on the left (in terms of handedness, of course). The lengthy list of left-handed leaders includes four of the last seven commanders in chief — President Obama , Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Gerald Ford — as well as past presidents James Garfield and Harry Truman. In fact, there’s a rumor that Ronald Reagan was born a leftie, but stringent schoolteachers converted him to a righty when he was young. Should right-handed presidential wannabes fake it? Our penchant for left-handed POTUSes is probably pure coincidence. But one recent Dutch study suggests that left-handed politicians actually have an advantage in televised debates. As a whole, people tend to associate right-handed gestures with “good” and left-handed gestures with “bad,” according to the researchers. Since television presents a mirror image, the lefties are the ones who appear to gesture with their right hands (the “good” hand). Getty Images  Southpaws Will Beat You in Sports Golf legend Phil Mickelson, tennis ace Rafael Nadal, boxing champ Oscar de la Hoya — did you know that a number of your favorite sports superstars are lefties? Actually, left-handers may have the advantage in sports that involve two opponents facing each other, such as in tennis, boxing, and baseball, according to an MSNBC review of the book The Puzzle of Left-Handedness, by Rik Smits. The author chalks it up to the fact that left-handed athletes get a lot more opportunity to practice against right-handed opponents than vice versa (since there are so many more righties out there). Now that’s a home run for lefties.   Lefties Are Scaredy-Cats Boo! If you’re a left-hander, that probably made you cringe. That’s because people whose left hands are dominant tend to be more affected by fear than people who use their right hands, according to research presented at an annual conference of The British Psychological Society and reported in the Telegraph. For the study, participants watched an eight-minute clip from the frightening film Silence of the Lambs. When asked to recall events from the segment, lefties were far more likely to show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder than righties, including giving fragmented descriptions and making more mistakes. "It seems that after experiencing a fearful event, even on film, people who are left-handed had subtle behaviors that were like people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder," head researcher Carolyn Choudhary, PhD, told t he Telegraph. Blame the brain: “It is apparent that the two sides of the brain have different roles in PTSD, and the right hand-side of the brain seems to be involved in fear. But we need to do more experiments to understand what exactly is going on here,” she said.   Grrr! Left-Handers Get Angrier, Too If you just can’t let go of that spat you had with your right-handed pal (but he seemed to move on just fine), you may be able to blame it on your left-handedness. According to a small study published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease , lefties are more prone to having negative emotions. In addition, they seem to have a more difficult time processing their feelings. Again, this seems to be related to the brain-hand connection. Compared to righties, left-handed participants in the study showed an imbalance in activity between the left and right hemispheres when trying to process their moodiness .   Easily Embarrassed? Could Be Because You're a Leftie Aw-shucks. Lefties may get bent out of shape, but research shows they're just a bunch of bashful self-observers . When scientists from Abertay University in Scotland gave 46 lefties and 66 righties  behavioral tests to measure their impulsiveness and personal restraint , the left-handers in the group more commonly agreed with statements like "I worry about making mistakes" and "Criticism or scolding hurts me quite a bit." In fact, their answers left researchers believing that lefties tend to feel more inhibited, shy, and embarrassed than their right-handed counterparts. "Left-handers are more likely to hesitate, whereas right-handers tend to jump in a bit more," lead researcher Lynn Wright, PhD, told BBC News .   Lefties Like to Booze Next time you have a run-in with a boozed-up barfly, check out which hand he’s holding his whisky with: chances are, it’ll be his left. For years, myth has held that left-handers are more likely to become alcoholics . Research into the topic was murky, however, and relied on small samples. But a survey of more than 25,000 people from 12 countries has cleared things up a bit. While lefties are not more prone to alcoholism, they do drink more often. Researcher Kevin Denny, who examined the data for a paper published in the British Journal of Health Psychology , says the main takeaway should be debunking that whole left-handedness-alcoholism link. “There is no evidence that handedness predicts risky drinking,” he stated in a press release. “Hence, the results do not support the idea that excess drinking may be a consequence either of atypical lateralisation of the brain, or due to the social stresses that arise from left-handers' being a minority group.”   They Have Their Own Day! Mark your calendar: August 13 is International Left-Handers Day. Lefties across the globe celebrate the annual event, which was launched in 1992 by the UK-based Left-Handers Club to increase awareness about the left-handed lifestyle. According to the group's Web site, it’s a day “when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed.” How should you observe the occasion? Create a “leftie zone”: a designated area of personal space where everything must be done in a left-handed fashion, from your workspace setup to the way you use cutlery. And that rule also extends to any right-handers who happen to enter the leftie zone.   Lefties Aren't Going Anywhere Left-handers are the minority. So does that mean they’ll go extinct one day? In fact, some researchers believe that when it comes to survival of the fittest, lefties come out on top. Here’s why: In one-on-one combat, using the left-hand is like throwing a curveball. "The fact that left-handers are less common means they have a surprise effect," University of Montpellier researcher Charlotte Faurie told ABC News . To dig deeper, Faurie and her colleague Michel Raymond studied nine different primitive societies. In more violent societies, they found, lefties thrived (think southpaw slugger Rocky Balboa’s left hook). Looks like the left hand has the upper hand after all.

A report published in the journal Current Biology reveals the birds show a preference for which side they hold sticks when using them to poke larvae out of holes.  Scientists believe the left or right bias is connected to their vision – and the clever crows try to keep the tip of the stick in view of their strongest eye.  Humans have been arguing about left and right for centuries. In medieval times lefties were thought to be in league with the devil and considered less intelligent than right-handers.  Then modern research discovered the wiring of our brains controls which hand we favour – and that left handers may be more artistic, are better tennis players and grow up quicker than right handers.  Here’s how lefties and righties compare...   Just 12 per cent of the world’s population are left handed – and twice as many men as women. 30 per cent of us are mixed-handed and switch hands during some tasks. Ambidextrous people can do any task equally well with either hand, but it’s exceptionally rare. Ambilevous or ambisinister are awkward with both hands.  Our brains are cross-wired meaning the left hemisphere controls the right handed side of the body and vice-versa. So left handers can boast they are always in their right mind.              President: The most powerful man in the world is left-handed  (Image: Getty)     The left hemisphere also controls speech, language, writing, logic, maths and science while the right side controls controls music, art, creativity, perception, emotions, and genius. So left-handers are more likely to be creative and visual thinkers, better at 3D perception...which is why there are more left-handed architects than righties.  Right handed people will earn 12 per cent more over their lifetimes than lefties. A study of 47,000 people in the UK and US suggest left-handers are at a significant disadvantage in the workplace. Harvard economist Joshua Goodman claimed “lefties have more emotional and behavioural problems, have more learning disabilities such as dyslexia, complete less schooling, and work in occupations requiring less cognitive skill.”  During the Middle Ages, left-handed folk were thought to be possessed by the Devil – prompting the modern definition of the word sinister which comes from sinistra, the Latin word for left.  The English word left comes from the Old English lyft, meaning idle, weak, or useless. The French word for left, gauche, also means clumsy or awkward.  Christianity is strongly based towards the right hand. It is the right had that gives the blessing and makes the sign of the cross. The bible contains more than 100 favourable references to the right-hand and 25 unfavourable references to the left-hand.              May the lord be with the rightys: The Bible seemingly favours right-handed people  (Image: Getty)     Stone Age implements discovered seem equally divided between left and right and studies of cave drawings have indicated a preference for the left hand.  Nails grow faster on your dominant hand.  If both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. In 2006 a study of twins from 25,732 families suggest just 24 per cent had inherited it. Researchers recently located a gene they think controls handedness.  Research in 2001 suggested lefties tend to die three years younger than righties although extremely left-handed people have a life expectancy that is just one year lower.  Left-handers get all sorts of strange – and often unpleasant – nicknames. Researchers found 88 different words in English dialects including: gar-pawed, cack-handed, gibble-fisted, scoochy, kay-neived, corrie-fisted, cuddy-wifted and kittaghy.  In Australia they are “mollydookers”, in Italian it’s “mancino” meaning crooked and in the US they are “southpaws” - a term derived from baseball. Parks were often built with the homeplate in the western corner of the field. When a left-handed pitcher was facing the batsman, his throwing arm would be the closest to the south, hence ‘Southpaw’ was coined.  The Meru people of Kenya believed that the left-hand of their holy man possessed such evil power that he had to keep it hidden for the safety of others.  Four of the five original designers of the Macintosh computer were left-handed as were one in four Apollo astronauts including Neil Armstrong.              Neil Armstrong: The first man on the moon was a lefty     Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci were both left-handed. Other famous lefties include Jack The Ripper, Napoleon Bonaparte, Joan of Arc, the Queen Mother Prince William, Winston Churchill, Tom Cruise, Morgan Freema, Judy Garland, Chewbacca the Wookie, Bob Geldof, Jimi Hendrix and Sir Paul McCartney.  Left handers are more likely to have allergies, migraines and insomnia and are three times more likely to become alcoholics as the right side of the brain - which is dominant in left handers - has a lower tolerance to alcohol!  Right handed people reach puberty four to five months earlier than lefties.  Left handers make especially good baseball players, tennis players, swimmers, boxers and fencers. Almost 40% of the top tennis players are lefties, including Rafael Nadal who has won 14 grand slam titles.  August 13th has been declared International Left Handers Day.  Five of the seven most recent U.S Presidents have been left handed – Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and current leader Barack Obama .  On a QWERTY keyboard there are 1447 English words typed solely with the left hand, whilst only 187 are typed with the right hand.  The official Boy Scout handshake uses the left hand, not the right. Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouts was ambidextrous but he chose the left hand because it is closer to the heart.     poll loading   Which is your dominant hand?  4000+ VOTES SO FAR   Left  Right  I'm a wizard (ambidextrous)   Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter MirrorSciTech Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletter Enter email Subscribe More On Oxford University Left Handedness   News all Most Read Most Recent Weather UK weather: Britain to be 'hotter than Greece' as temperatures soar to 25C bringing week-long sizzle The weekend marks a hike in temperatures with most parts expected to bask in some much-welcomed spring sunshine.

By Maria Konnikova August 22, 2013 Cesare Lombroso, the father of modern criminology, owes his career to a human skull. In 1871, as a young doctor at a mental asylum in Pavia, Italy, he autopsied the brain of Giuseppe Villela, a Calabrese peasant turned criminal, who has been described as an Italian Jack the Ripper. “At the sight of that skull,” Lombroso said , “I seemed to see all at once, standing out clearly illuminated as in a vast plain under a flaming sky, the problem of the nature of the criminal, who reproduces in civilised times characteristics, not only of primitive savages, but of still lower types as far back as the carnivora.” Lombroso would go on to argue that the key to understanding the essence of criminality lay in organic, physical, and constitutional features—each defect being a throwback to a more primitive and bestial psyche. And while his original insight had come from a skull, certain telltale signs, he believed, could be discerned long before an autopsy. Chief among these was left-handedness. In 1903, Lombroso summarized his views on the left-handed of the world. “What is sure,” he wrote, “is, that criminals are more often left-handed than honest men, and lunatics are more sensitively left-sided than either of the other two.” Left-handers were more than three times as common in criminal populations as they were in everyday life, he found. The prevalence among swindlers was even higher: up to thirty-three per cent were left-handed—in contrast to the four per cent Lombroso found within the normal population. He ended on a conciliatory note. “I do not dream at all of saying that all left-handed people are wicked, but that left-handedness, united to many other traits, may contribute to form one of the worst characters among the human species.” Though Lombroso’s science may seem suspect to a modern eye, less-than-favorable views of the left-handed have persisted. In 1977, the psychologist Theodore Blau argued that left-handed children were over-represented among the academically and behaviorally challenged, and were more vulnerable to mental diseases like schizophrenia. “Sinister children,” he called them. The psychologist Stanley Coren, throughout the eighties and nineties, presented evidence that the left-handed lived shorter, more impoverished lives, and that they were more likely to experience delays in mental and physical maturity, among other signs of “neurological insult or physical malfunctioning.” Toward the end of his career, the Harvard University neurologist Norman Geschwind implicated left-handedness in a range of problematic conditions, including migraines, diseases of the immune system, and learning disorders. He attributed the phenomenon, and the related susceptibilities, to higher levels of testosterone in utero, which, he argued, slowed down the development of the brain’s left hemisphere (the one responsible for the right side of the body). But over the past two decades, the data that seemed compelling have largely been discredited. In 1993 , the psychologist Marian Annett, who has spent half a century researching “handedness,” as it is known, challenged the basic foundation of Coren’s findings. The data, she argued, were fundamentally flawed: it wasn’t the case that left-handers led shorter lives. Rather, the older you were, the more likely it was that you had been forced to use your right hand as a young child. The mental-health data have also withered: a 2010 analysis of close to fifteen hundred individuals that included schizophrenic patients and their non-affected siblings found that being left-handed neither increased the risk of developing schizophrenia nor predicted any other cognitive or neural disadvantage. And when a group of neurologists scanned the brains of four hundred and sixty-five adults, they found no effect of handedness on either grey or white matter volume or concentration, either globally or regionally. Left-handers may, in fact, even derive certain cognitive benefits from their preference. This spring, a group of psychiatrists from the University of Athens invited a hundred university students and graduates—half left-handed and half right—to complete two tests of cognitive ability. In the Trail Making Test, participants had to find a path through a batch of circles as quickly as possible. In the hard version of the test, the circles contain numbers and letters, and participants must move in ascending order while alternating between the two as fast as possible. In the second test, Letter-Number Sequencing, participants hear a group of numbers and letters and must then repeat the whole group, but with numbers in ascending order and letters organized alphabetically. Lefties performed better on both the complex version of the T.M.T.—demonstrating faster and more accurate spatial skills, along with strong executive control and mental flexibility—and on the L.N.S., demonstrating enhanced working memory. And the more intensely they preferred their left hand for tasks, the stronger the effect. The Athens study points to a specific kind of cognitive benefit, since both the T.M.T. and the L.N.S. are thought to engage, to a large extent, the right hemisphere of the brain. But a growing body of research suggests another, broader benefit: a boost in a specific kind of creativity—namely, divergent thinking, or the ability to generate new ideas from a single principle quickly and effectively. In one demonstration , researchers found that the more marked the left-handed preference in a group of males, the better they were at tests of divergent thought. (The demonstration was led by the very Coren who had originally argued for the left-handers’ increased susceptibility to mental illness.) Left-handers were more adept, for instance, at combining two common objects in novel ways to form a third—for example, using a pole and a tin can to make a birdhouse. They also excelled at grouping lists of words into as many alternate categories as possible. Another recent study has demonstrated an increased cognitive flexibility among the ambidextrous and the left-handed—and lefties have been found to be over-represented among architects , musicians , and art and music students (as compared to those studying science). Part of the explanation for this creative edge may lie in the greater connectivity of the left-handed brain. In a meta-analysis of forty-three studies, the neurologist Naomi Driesen and the cognitive neuroscientist Naftali Raz concluded that the corpus callosum—the bundle of fibers that connects the brain’s hemispheres—was slightly but significantly larger in left-handers than in right-handers. The explanation could also be a much more prosaic one: in 1989, a group of Connecticut College psychologists suggested that the creativity boost was a result of the environment, since left-handers had to constantly improvise to deal with a world designed for right-handers. In a 2013 review of research into handedness and cognition, a group of psychologists found that the main predictor of cognitive performance wasn’t whether an individual was left-handed or right-handed, but rather how strongly they preferred one hand over another. Strongly handed individuals, both right and left, were at a slight disadvantage compared to those who occupied the middle ground—both the ambidextrous and the left-handed who, through years of practice, had been forced to develop their non-dominant right hand. In those less clear-cut cases, the brain’s hemispheres interacted more and overall performance improved, indicating there may something to left-handed brains being pushed in a way that a right-handed one never is. Whatever the ultimate explanation may be, the advantage appears to extend to other types of thinking, too. In a 1986 study of students who had scored in the top of their age group on either the math or the verbal sections of the S.A.T., the prevalence of left-handers among the high achievers—over fifteen per cent, as compared to the roughly ten percent found in the general population—was higher than in any comparison groups, which included their siblings and parents. Among those who had scored in the top in both the verbal and math sections, the percentage of left-handers jumped to nearly seventeen per cent, for males, and twenty per cent, for females. That advantage echoes an earlier sample of elementary-school children, which found increased left-handedness among children with I.Q. scores above a hundred and thirty-one. Lombroso’s scientific conclusions about criminal physiology may be closer to Franz Joseph Gall’s phrenology than to any modern understanding of the brain. But he might not have been so far off the mark when he hypothesized that by looking at someone’s hands, we could learn something about the inner workings of their minds—though those workings have more to do with cognitive achievement than any inclination to commit highway robbery. Michelangelo and da Vinci were left-handed, after all. As were three of the last four occupants of the White House; the only right-handed President since the end of the Cold War has been George W. Bush. Maria Konnikova  is the author of the New York Times best-seller “ Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes . ” She has a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University.
