For starters, people describe this magnificent eye color in many different ways. Some say it looks like hazelnut, while others call it golden or brownish green. One of the reasons it's so hard to describe hazel-colored eyes is that the hue itself seems to change, depending on what you wear and the type of lighting you are in.  To complicate matters further, although hazel eyes appear to contain hues of green, amber and even blue, these color pigments don't exist in the human eye. So where does this stunning color come from?  What Determines Eye Color?  Most of us were taught in high school science class that we inherit our eye color from our parents, and that brown eye color is dominant and blue is recessive (so two parents with blue eyes cannot have a child with brown eyes because neither parent carries the dominant form of the gene for brown eyes).                   Hazel eyes often have a mixture of green, brown and amber hues. Their color can be hard to describe, since ambient lighting and clothing colors can affect your perception of them. [Enlarge]     But it turns out the story is more complicated than that.  More recent research has shown that up to 16 genes (not just one or two) may influence eye color, which makes predicting eye color much more difficult.  Due to variations in the interaction and expression of multiple genes, it's hard to say for sure what color a child's eyes will be based on the color of his or her parents' eyes. For example, we now know it's possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a child with brown eyes  something the old model of eye color inheritance would have deemed impossible.

Also, eye color can change dramatically in the first few years of life; many white, non-Hispanic babies are born with blue eyes and then develop brown, green or hazel eyes in childhood. This phenomenon has little to do with genetics, but it does help explain where hazel eyes come from.  What Causes Hazel Eyes?  The pigmented structure inside the eye that surrounds the pupil and gives eyes their color is called the iris . The pigment responsible for eye color is called melanin, which also affects skin color.  The reason many white, non-Hispanic babies are born with blue eyes is that they don't have the full amount of melanin present in their irises at birth. In the first few years of life, more melanin often develops in the iris, causing blue eyes to turn green, hazel or brown.  Babies whose eyes turn from blue to brown develop significant amounts of melanin. Those who end up with green eyes or hazel eyes develop a little less.  Babies of African-American, Hispanic and Asian ethnicities usually are born with dark eyes that stay brown throughout life. This is because these individuals naturally have more melanin in their eyes and skin, compared with non-Hispanic whites.     Light Absorption And Scattering  Remember, there are no blue, green or hazel pigments in the eye. Eyes merely have different amounts of melanin, which is dark brown.  So how can a dark brown pigment create blue, green or hazel eyes? This is possible because of two processes:   Melanin in the iris absorbs different wavelengths of light entering the eye.  Light is scattered and reflected by the iris, and some wavelengths (colors) scatter more easily than others.   Eyes with high concentrations of melanin absorb more light entering the eye, so less is scattered and reflected back from the iris. The result is a brown eye color.  In eyes with lower concentrations of melanin, less light is absorbed, and more is scattered and reflected by the iris. Since light rays with shorter wavelengths (blue and green light) scatter more easily than light rays with longer wavelengths (red light), eyes with less light-absorbing melanin appear green or hazel, and eyes with low concentrations of melanin appear blue.  Also, the distribution of melanin can vary in different parts of the iris, causing hazel eyes to appear light brown near the pupil and more green in the periphery of the iris.  Hazel Eyes Are A Work Of Art  Hazel eye color is both complex and magnificent, since its specific features are determined by so many factors  including the amount and distribution of melanin in the iris, how scattering of light by the iris and pigment molecules affects color, and how perception of eye color is influenced by lighting and the color of our clothing and surroundings.  Just as it takes many strokes of the artist's brush to produce a masterpiece, hazel eyes involve the dynamics of several elements to create the unique work of art that's represented in every hazel eye.  If you wear eyeglasses, choose lenses with anti-reflective coating to eliminate distracting reflections in your glasses and allow others to see the beauty of your hazel eye color.  Change Your Eye Color To Hazel  If your eyes aren't naturally hazel, but you've always wanted them to be, you can achieve your wish with color contact lenses. They won't actually change your eye color, of course, just the appearance of it.  Want to try hazel eye color? Ask your eye care professional for a prescription for color contact lenses. [Enlarge]   Contact lenses are available in many colors, so you'll have a choice of several shades of hazel. But it's not simply a matter of choosing a lens color you like; the natural color of your eyes has a role in determining which lenses you should wear.  If you have very light eyes, you might be able to use a lens with an "enhancement tint." This lens has a translucent color that lets some of your natural color show through. It's meant to enhance your natural eye color  to make your light blue eyes a deeper blue, for example  but if your eyes are light enough, you might achieve the hazel you want with an enhancement tint.  More likely, you'll need an "opaque tint." These lenses are designed to mask your natural color with a solid version of the color you desire. They're often used when the color you want to achieve is lighter than your natural color.  An eye care professional can show you various colors and help you make the right choice. Remember, contact lenses are a prescription item, and if you don't already wear contacts, you'll need an eye exam and a prescription before getting them  even if your lenses don't need any corrective power in them.

But the prevalence of brown eyes varies significantly with geography.  Most people living in Africa and Asia have dark brown eyes. Dark brown eye color also is very common in the Middle East. But in Europe, both the prevalence and shade of brown eyes vary significantly from region to region.  In the United States, an estimated 41 percent of the population has brown eyes  including dark brown eyes, light brown eyes and honey brown eyes. If you include hazel eyes (sometimes called hazel brown eyes), the prevalence is even higher.  But the high prevalence doesn't mean all brown eyes look the same. There is plenty of variation in the appearance from person to person, and there are even health advantages to having brown eyes (more about that later).  What Causes Brown Eyes?  Even though there are different eye colors, including less common blue eyes and green eyes , there is only one type of eye color pigment. The amount of this pigment (called melanin) present in the iris of your eye determines the color of your eyes.                   Brown eyes range from dark, coffee-colored brown to light amber or honey brown. The color brown is associated with earth and the natural world, and research suggests people perceive brown-eyed individuals as being more trustworthy. [Enlarge]     Eyes with very little melanin in the iris are blue. Eyes with a bit more melanin are green, hazel or light brown. And those with a high concentration of melanin are medium or dark brown.   Recommended For You      Questions about cataracts?

Get $2 off!     Eye color is an inherited trait. But predicting eye color from your family tree is more difficult than you might expect. In fact, there is evidence that up to 16 genes can influence eye color. So it's very possible for children in the same family to have different eye colors, and eyes that are not the same color as those of their parents. Due to complex variations and interactions of genes, it's hard to say with certainty what color eyes a child might end up with.  Also, the eyes of many Caucasian babies contain very little melanin at birth and will appear blue the first few months of life. But within 12 to 18 months, more melanin can accumulate in the iris, causing eye color to change from blue to green, hazel or brown.  Benefits Of Brown Eyes  If you have brown eyes, you'll be happy to know that researchers have found the higher melanin content in your eyes is associated with a number of health benefits.  People with brown eyes may be less vulnerable to certain diseases. For example, people with brown eyes appear less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration than people with light-colored eyes.     Also, people with brown eyes have a lower risk of type 1 diabetes and melanoma of the eye, compared with individuals with light blue eyes. And research at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London suggests individuals with blue eyes have a higher risk of hearing problems caused by environmental noise pollution compared with coworkers with brown eyes. The study authors felt melanin pigment may help protect nerves in the brain from noise-induced damage.  But it's not all good news for people with brown eyes.  Research conducted at the University of Pittsburgh found that women with dark-colored eyes seemed to experience more pain when giving birth compared with mothers with light-colored eyes. The women with light-colored eyes also had less anxiety, depression, negative thoughts and sleep disturbances than the women with brown eyes.  Also, an Australian study published in American Journal of Ophthalmology found that people with dark brown irises were more likely to develop cataracts than people with lighter-colored eyes. So be sure to wear sunglasses that protect your eyes from UV radiation outdoors if you have brown eyes. (In most cases, polarized sunglasses offer the greatest comfort in bright sunlight.)  Brown Eyes: More Trustworthy?  Did you know that having brown eyes may make you appear more trustworthy?  In research performed in the Czech Republic, university students were asked to look at photographs of 80 fellow students (40 males and 40 females, ages 19 to 26 years). Participants in the study were asked to rate the photographed students for trustworthiness on a 10-point scale.    Actress Taraji P. Henson has brown eyes. [Enlarge] (Photo: Featureflash Photo Agency / Shutterstock.com )  The students who were photographed were told to assume neutral, non-smiling expressions and not to wear any makeup or jewelry. All photos were cropped so that the eyes were always horizontally at the same height with a standard length of neck visible. Only photos of individuals with blue eyes or brown eyes were used in the study. Photos of students with hazel or green eyes were excluded.  Results of the study revealed that people with brown eyes were perceived as significantly more trustworthy than those with blue eyes.  But it's a little more complicated than that.  The researchers found a relationship existed between eye color and face shape, and that the shape of a person's face plays a key role in the perception of trustworthiness.  Brown-eyed faces tended to have a rounder and broader chin, a broader mouth with upward-pointing corners, relatively bigger eyes, and eyebrows closer to each other. In contrast, blue-eyed faces were characterized by a more angular and prominent lower face, a longer chin, a narrower mouth with downward-pointing corners, relatively smaller eyes and rather distant eyebrows.  "Brown-eyed individuals tend to be perceived as more trustworthy than blue-eyed ones," explained the study authors. "But it is not brown eyes that cause this perception. It is the facial morphology linked to brown eyes."  Eye Color Options  Despite the advantages associated with brown eyes, if you'd like to try other eye colors, you can. There is a wide variety of color contacts for brown eyes  and these appearance-changing colored lenses are available even if you don't need correction for nearsightedness , farsightedness or astigmatism . There are even colored contacts for brown eyes that can change the color of your eyes to light blue if that's what you desire.  Not ready for contacts but want to know other ways to make your brown eyes "pop?" If you wear eyeglasses , ask your optician to show you how different frame colors can complement and enhance your brown eyes. Also, choose lenses with anti-reflective coating to help showcase your eye color. AR coating eliminates annoying reflections in your eyeglasses, allowing others to see the beauty and expressiveness of your brown eyes.  Also, spend time with a professional aesthetician to discover the best eyeshadow and makeup for brown eyes. The right choices for you will depend on a number of factors  including your hair color and skin tone as well as the depth of the pigment in your brown eyes.

Please Share!   Human eye color charts once were used to "predict" eye colors of children.  In the most simplified versions of these charts, brown eyes are considered dominant over both blue and green eyes. And green eyes are thought to be dominant over blue eyes .  While these concepts generally are true, the genetics of how eye colors are inherited turn out to be far more complicated than once thought.  You can't simply determine the eye colors of grandparents and parents, then calculate the odds of what color a baby's eyes will be. In fact, you can belong to a family with many generations of brown-eyed individuals and still end up with green or blue eyes.    Eye Color Facts                 Contrary to popular belief, it's also possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.  Eye colors depend on the amount of pigment (melanin) found in the iris and how it is distributed. Light gray-blue eyes contain much less pigment than extremely dark brown eyes. And there are many shades of eye color in between.  SEE ALSO:  What Determines Hazel Eye Color >  Some people are even born with eyes of two different colors, a condition known as heterochromia .

Obviously, the percentage of dark brown eyes found in Asian and African populations will be much higher than in European populations.  And some day, blue may be a rare eye color. This is because more people now select mates outside usual cultural and ethic groups. So when a brown-eyed person marries someone with blue eyes, offspring are more likely to inherit the more dominant brown eyes.

Learn about the study • What causes hazel eyes • All about blue eyes • Is green the most attractive eye color? • Which color contact lenses you should choose   Eye color often is the genetic trait that fascinates parents the most as a child develops. Will the child's eyes be black, brown, blue, gray, green, hazel or some combination of colors?  How a child looks depends on the genetic material each parent contributes to the child. But the parents' genes can mix and match in many different ways. The influences from each parent aren't known until  surprise  after the child is born!  How Eye Color Develops  The colored part of the eye is called the iris , which has pigmentation that determines our eye color.   Her eyes may be blue only temporarily; babies' eyes can change color if the brown pigment melanin develops as they grow.  Human eye color originates with three genes, two of which are well understood. These genes account for the most common colors  green, brown, and blue. Other colors, such as gray, hazel and multiple combinations are not fully understood or explainable at this time.  We used to think of brown being "dominant" and blue being "recessive." But modern science has shown that eye color is not at all that simple.  Also, eye colors don't come out as a blend of the parents' colors, as in mixing paint. Each parent has two pairs of genes on each chromosome . So multiple possibilities exist, depending on how the "Wheel of Fortune" spins.  Dutch researchers have announced they are working on ways to determine eye color of adults with sophisticated DNA analysis that can predict with 90 percent accuracy whether people have brown or blue eyes .  In May 2010, the same researchers said they were closing in on the ability to more accurately predict even variable eye colors via DNA analysis and new understanding of how genetics govern eye color.    Eye Color Poll Results     After collecting 66,493 responses to our eye color poll , we thought it was time to share the results with you:  Green was the winner among our site visitors, but responses were spread pretty well over most of the other shades, too.  Sidebar continued >>   To some, eye color isn't that significant. As someone said on our Facebook page, "All eye colors can be 'the most attractive.' ... Your eye color has to be about you and express the truth of you to others."  Another person posted this comment about eye health being much more important: "The most attractive color is the white of the eye when it is clear and bright, which makes any iris beautiful."  L.S.     Researchers said these discoveries also have implications for forensic investigations at crime scenes where recovered DNA may give clues about the actual appearance of suspects.  Most babies are born with blue eyes that can darken in their first three years. Darkening occurs if melanin , a brown pigment usually not present at birth, develops with age.  Children can have completely different eye colors than either of their parents. But if both parents have brown eyes , it's most likely that their children also will have brown eyes.  The darker colors tend to dominate, so brown tends to win out over green, and green tends to win out over blue.  However, a brown/blue parent mix doesn't automatically produce a brown-eyed child.

Usually this is caused by faulty developmental pigment transport, local trauma either in the womb or shortly after birth or a benign genetic disorder.  Other causes can be inflammation, freckle (diffuse nevus) of the iris and Horner's syndrome .  Having an early eye exam is important to make sure nothing serious is going on  and "nothing serious" is the most common finding.  Changes In Eye Color  The iris is a muscle that expands and contracts to control pupil size. The pupil enlarges in dimmer lighting and grows smaller in brighter lighting. The pupil also shrinks when you focus on near objects, such as a book you are reading.  When the pupil size changes, the pigments in the iris compress or spread apart, changing the eye color a bit.  Certain emotions can change both the pupil size and the iris color. That's why some people say their eyes change colors when they're angry or loving.     Eye color also can change with age. This happens in 10 to 15 percent of the Caucasian population (people who generally have lighter eye colors).  For instance, my once very brown eyes are now hazel, a combination of brown and green. However, some hazel eyes actually get darker with age.  Note that if your adult eye color changes pretty dramatically, or if one eye changes from brown to green or blue to brown (called heterochromia ), it's important to see your eye doctor . Eye color changes can be a warning sign of certain diseases, such as Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis, Horner's syndrome or pigmentary glaucoma .  Ultimately, if you don't like the eye color you inherited, you can always change it with colored contact lenses . But remember, even colored contact lenses are a prescription medical device and must be prescribed and monitored by an eye doctor. Don't buy them over the Internet or get them from a friend without having an eye doctor's prescription!    Genes and Eye Color     What Color Will Your Baby's Eyes Be?  How eye color is inherited is far more complicated than what was thought back in the days when simple charts were created that supposedly could predict the eye color of children based on the eye color of their parents.  Generally, though, it's far more likely for two brown-eyed parents to have a blue-eyed child than for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child. This is because the generally less dominant blue-eyed trait can be passed along by brown-eyed people until the genes for the lighter eye color happen to match up, possibly many generations later.  Two blue-eyed parents, on the other hand, are much less likely to have darker-eyed children. This is because darker eyes generally are so much more dominant that the genetic trait, when present, ordinarily would first show up in the parent, who then wouldn't be blue-eyed at all.  Still, due to the complexities of how genetic traits are passed along, it is entirely possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.    Eyewear To Enhance Your Eye Color  If you wear eyeglasses, be sure to choose lenses with anti-reflective (AR) coating . AR-coated lenses eliminate annoying reflections in your glasses that prevent others from seeing the beauty and expressiveness of your eyes. Ask your optician for details and a demonstration.  Also, read about how to choose eyeglass frames that highlight and enhance the color of your eyes and skin tone.

Male with Hazel Eye Color Hazel Eyes Female WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF HAZEL EYES? You may be curious about the science behind hazel colored eyes. In a nutshell, your eye color is a function of heredity and genetics. The two primary factors that influence eye color are: 1) pigmentation of the iris and 2) how light scatters around the iris. Your eye pigmentation can run a virtual rainbow, from the darkest color of green to the lightest color of blue. A substance called melanin largely influences what color your eyes will ultimately be. Melanin is a complex polymer made from an amino acid called tyrosine . If you have haze eyes, it is because of a phenomenon Rayleigh scattering. In non-science speak, Rayleigh scattering is nothing more than a presentation of how light scatters over an object after riding its spectrum wavelength. Related:  Amber eyes: Learn all about this gold eye color A lot of folks think that eye color is a function of the iris but in truth, it’s not. The unique eye color you have, such as hazel, is the direct result of how light breaks up across melanin’s base. This is not something you can manipulate and is determined by genetics. Science of Hazel Eyes in People  Melanin content in eye color of people with hazel, brown, blue, violet and grey and black eyes Eye Color Melanin Amount:  Front Layer of Iris Melanin Amount: Back Layer of Iris Dominant Pigmentation Hazel Medium: Less than green. More than brown Normal Eumelanin and Pheomelanin Brown Substantial Normal Eumelanin Blue Light Normal Eumelanin Green Closer to blue; less than brown Normal Pheomelanin Grey Less than green and hazel Normal Eumelanin mix Violet/Purple Small to none Small to little Unknown Black Heavy Heavy Black Eumelanin Credit: Wikicommons HOW PEOPLE GET HAZEL EYES The current research in the field of genetics suggests that eye color is largely determined by 16 genes that are passed on to you through heredity. This new theory does away with what scientists used to think – which basically stated that your hazel eyes (or any other eye color) happened because of a dominant gene. HAZEL EYES AND RACE Hazel colored eyes, including shades of brown/green and green/blue , have been part of the genetic sequencing of certain races for thousands of years – maybe even millions. If you are Spanish, Middle Eastern, Brazilian or North African decent, there is a higher likelihood of hazel eyes running in your family tree. This does not preclude other races from having hazel eyes however; any population group can have hazel eyes. Jesse Metcalfe has hazel color eyes CAN EYE COLOR BE CHANGED? Many people are curious if eye color can be changed. The answer is yes and no. The “Yes” part relates to how your eye color will naturally change as a result of how light scatters across the iris. The “No” part has to do with the clinical presentation of eye color. You either have hazel eyes or you don’t. You can’t “inject” something into the iris to make them permanently darker, lighter, greener or bluer. HOW HEALTH IMPACTS EYE COLOR Over the course of your lifetime, your eye color may change as a result of age and health. And you should know the color of your eye can permanently change because of the medical condition known as ocular glaucoma. If you have hazel colored eyes, make sure you visit with your eye doctor regularly because you can lose that color as a result of glaucoma degradation. Jade and Hazel are amazing colors for eyes HAZEL EYES: HEALTH ISSUES People with hazel eyes are susceptible to the harmful effects of our sun. The primary reason is connected to the substance we discussed earlier, melanin. People with hazel eyes can develop certain types of ocular cancers , like intra-ocular melanoma. It is suggested that people with hazel colored eyes and other eye colors for that matter wear sunglasses that offer strong UV protection. Hazel eyes often combine different eye colors   HAZEL EYES: MIX OF GREEN, BROWN AND BLUE No two pair of hazel eyes is exactly the same. Some people have lighter features of green while others have darker features of brown. Ocular scientists think hazel eye color is a combination of greens, browns and blues but if truth be told, they aren’t exactly sure. We do know however, that hazel is considered rare. Hazel Eyes Channing Tatum HAZEL EYES AND INTENSITY CHANGES The intensity of the color people see when they look into your hazel eyes is influenced by a number of factors. Depending upon sunlight, your health and atmospheric conditions, some people may experience your hazel colored eyes as bright green, seaweed amber, dazzling emerald or even grey. Here are some of the primary factors influencing hazel eye color intensity: Time of day: Light from the celestial orb we call the sun has a major impact on eye color hew and intensity as expressed through the solar spectrum . Lighting conditions: If you are indoors, the lightbulbs you use to create artificial light can impact how your eyes appear to others. Some shades of hazel become amplified indoors while others do not. Clothing: Depending upon the type of clothing you are wearing, the intensity of your eye color can become stronger and weaker. Colors like gold, blue and various greens can give your hazel eyes a deeper appearance. Makeup for hazel eyes: One of the most powerful ways your hazel eyes can “pop” when others look at them relates to the type of makeup you are wearing. Generally speaking, chocolate or brown eye shadow is recommended for hazel green eyes. Allergies: If you suffer from seasonal allergies, your eye color can experience changes in general intensity. You may take on a reddish hew around the white of the eyeball. Allergies also can cause your eyes to look baggy and puffy . Drugs/Alcohol: Believe it or not, if you use certain types of medications, illicit drugs or drink alcohol, it can impact how others experience your eye color. Some prescription medications are known to cause changes. Be sure to check with your doctor if you notice any variations in ocular appearance. Your emotions: This one may seem silly but if you are sad, crying, happy, joyous or in any way overwhelmed with emotions, the intensity of those hazel eyes you see can change. Don’t worry, it’s only temporary. HAZEL EYE MAKEUP TO ENHANCE COLOR This video offers tips to women with hazel colored eyes who are looking for advice on how to enhance their eye color.

Avoid tying your eye color to aspects of your self-worth. Happiness comes from being in a state of mind and not your eyes. <a href=”http://polldaddy.com/poll/8483898/”>Which eye color is most attractive?</a> HAZEL EYES AND ZODIAC SIGN Many people who have hazel eyes have a keen interest in their zodiac sign. This is particularly true of people who are Cancers and Scorpios . The truth is, your astrological sign really has nothing to do with your eyes – yet many people seem to assign magical qualities just the same. There are folks who have suggested that if you have hazel eyes, you have special powers that come from a different dimension. Here, we are talking about psychic abilities or the power to sense the emotions of others. To date, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. FINAL THOUGHTS ON OLIVE HAZEL There is much we still do not know about eye color, including hazel colored eyes. What we do know is that many people want to change their eye color to hazel or green. In fact, some people have undergone questionable medical procedures in order for this to happen. It’s probably better to get a pair of colored contacted than travel to another country for something risky.  Hopefully, you found the material on this post useful and informative.

Renee Andrews  says:   January 27, 2016 at 9:42 pm  Thanks!   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:28 pm  Same people say I’m creepy because my eye colour changes (I have hazel eyes)   phoenix  says:   January 30, 2016 at 12:54 am  I have hazel eyes. They are mostly green with yellow cloudy poofs all around them. I hate them. They look yellow or green depending on the light and my family loves it because im the only one in our known lineage with this mutation. But I cant for the life of me find any good makeup tutorials and I dont even like my eyes much.   Rachel  says:   July 5, 2016 at 5:11 pm  Aww. That’s terrible. The eyes are the windows to the soul. Your eye color is definitely not a mutation or a curse. I am sure they are beautiful and engaging.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:19 pm  I go with purple or brown/purple shades and they look awesome. Don’t do blue. Always go for a natural looking contrast to the main color of your eyes.   Alexandria  says:   March 20, 2016 at 6:28 am  I have hazle eyes! – they’re a dark gray/blue rim on the outside then followed by a forest green after that and have a gold/brown near the pupils. Their very unique…even my twins eyes are different! I am a girl and he is a boy though!   Theescapefromreality  says:   May 21, 2016 at 11:57 am  What colour is my eyes? Some say my eyes are hazel, some say green and some say both? Help ????   Arthur Kirkland  says:   October 14, 2016 at 11:23 am  They are hazel as they have another colour with the green   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 23, 2016 at 7:26 pm  Your eyes are not hazel, but rather you have a genetic mutation called Central Heterochromia – commonly confused with hazel eyes. Your eyes lack a blue limbal ring, that those with hazel eyes almost always have.   Cristian Grothaus Peyrot  says:   October 23, 2016 at 9:38 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/690baf7a69f2ef1120f12685b7a77929f3881497099257edb98f43694c1e53c0.jpg What about my eyes?   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 25, 2016 at 12:13 am  I’d say you have hazel eyes. 🙂 Although it’s hard to see from the photo, it looks like you have a very faint band of green around the brown in the middle. Followed by a ring of blue, then brown, then blue again. So hazel. Very intriguing hazel eyes, might I add.   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 25, 2016 at 12:31 am  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/29fc4170e2cca4e749a64adcc0afdb7136eecc55b5925a7ac546ecfc9b303d5a.png Just to give an example of an iris with Central Heterochromia, here is a picture of my eye.   Cristian Grothaus Peyrot  says:   October 25, 2016 at 3:49 pm  Well, thanks for your reply, that’s the best photo that I have, anyway How my eyes looks depends totally on the amount of light, at night normally they look more brown and in the daylight I’ve been told that they were green, turquoise or even gray somehow.   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 26, 2016 at 11:00 am  You’re welcome. That is a characteristic trait of hazel eyes – appearing to change colour. That’s due to their medium levels of melanin, so depending on the lighting, what you’re wearing etc… they can appear to be different colours.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:18 pm  Very pretty.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:17 pm  Whoa, beautiful eyes!   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:17 pm  Very pretty.   Malcolm Brown  says:   June 21, 2016 at 1:00 pm  It’s not Melatonin, it’s Melanin. Good article though.   shrugger  says:   July 4, 2016 at 8:24 pm  Mine have gradually changed color as I’ve aged. Blue was more dominant till my mid 20’s. But the yellow center is now dominant in my 40’s.   Rachel  says:   July 5, 2016 at 5:08 pm  I’m with you on that one, Renee. And when my now husband and I were just starting to get to know each other, I seriously thought he did not know what color my eyes are. I asked him  one day and he said, ‘that’s a trick question. They change all the time!’ Oddly enough, sometimes my eyes will be two different colors and that’s really weird. Like one will be totally blue and the other more green. Normally, the base color is a mix of light and dark green, with a goldish center and a grey-blue ring round the outside. My eye doctor actually said that hazel is not a true color, but rather a blend of other colors, and only people with hazel eyes will have the dark ring in contrast with the color. I have to say though, my eyes are my best and favorite feature. 🙂   Kate Dowdeswell  says:   August 5, 2016 at 2:35 pm  Eeeerm I’m really sorry but I am literally unable to stop myself correcting shit. In the article above, they have mistakenly written melatonin instead of melanin. As far as I’m aware melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone which helps people relax before going to sleep in the evening. People suffering from ADHD have a lacking amount of this hormone and can be prescribed melatonin tablets to help them sleep. Melanin is the substance that affects eye and skin colourations.   Fire Shadow  says:   September 11, 2016 at 10:39 pm  A lot of people have been saying that my eyes are green/brown, but some people say they will sometimes change. Are they hazel?   Arthur Kirkland  says:   October 14, 2016 at 1:50 am  I have hazel eyes, i have brown around my pupil and yellow/green on the outer and i have a dark ring surrounding it. my father has brown eyes with a blue ring around them, my mother has the same eyes as i do but unlike mine that look greener in the light theirs looks brown and in dim light mine look brown and theirs looks hazel and my siblings have brown eyes (my eldest sister wears contacts)   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:30 pm  My mum has blue eyes and my dad has brown eyes. I was born with blue eyes but they have now turned hazel   kiLLer Z  says:   October 14, 2016 at 11:57 am  Is  this one Hazel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/41ff8058d80cb6b5773d2211ea4cff344d9a5dcfde042841946dac012a427ba3.jpg   Ham  says:   February 18, 2017 at 12:52 pm  Well there is some sort of green. My sister’s eyes are similar. Once she  is in the sun the Green really pops out. Mine look bit greener in general, but in the Sun her eyes have a more intensiv green. So jap it could be possible ^^   Ham  says:   February 18, 2017 at 1:40 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/037d168c29b929568f81bf28ad7849d22f44fd1eafdbfeb296bb627106b0e76b.jpg With a flash-light my eyes look like this btw.   Sarus Drake  says:   November 6, 2016 at 6:57 pm  I have golden hazel eyes and people have always been drawn to them. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been complimented on them. Though it gets a little strange when total strangers tell you how your eyes are so dark gold and so beautiful when your 9. To be honest, I thought about getting colored contacts and going with brown for a while. But I’ve chosen to embrace my eyes and love the color.

Although they can change to a more golden brown on occasion.   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:36 pm  My eyes tend be lighter and greener when there is lots of light they also tend to be gold at times or change colour.

Always thought I had brown eyes that changed colours because my mom has brown eyes and my dad had green eyes. Then I read something about eye colours a few years ago, and apparently it doesn’t work that way. My eyes usually change depending on the light, on how I feel (if I cry they turn completely green), and what colours I’m wearing.  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/726c78c762aa5e2bb7773b71fefc80e296e62dd81bf0e57c819c65fac9eada60.png   ShadowOfCicero  says:   March 28, 2017 at 9:08 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0ec9c04e6f29d366fc7299b42230397ddc5079f2a5b6e8dad31f80efb73ca026.png These are my eyes with the flash on. The little white square is flash. A lot of people tell me that I have green— and I’d much prefer them to be such, in my own personal opinion— although I believe it’s hazel. It’s blue with a green-brown although it rarely appears blue. Technically: Hazel. Appears: Green. Thoughts?

It appears like this most of time, although they look brown from a distance.   Sonya Marlene Tanner  says:   April 11, 2017 at 4:48 pm  Here are my eyes. They are green with a small amount of amber in them. Didn’t know if I had hazel eyes or not.

My sisters were brown for 56 of her years but a week ago I noticed they were hazel, like mine. I asked her what, how, when and she said she didn’t know, she noticed a couple months ago that they had changed but she didn’t know how or why. She’s a professional, doesn’t smoke, drink or do drugs. I came to this site looking for answers. Does anyone have one?   John D.

Posted on August 25, 2010 in General Eye Care  When someone wants to enhance their vision, they may try contact lenses or seek out LASIK eye surgery . But what if they want to change the color of their eyes? People have long been fascinated with eye color; after all, eyes come in a wide range of shades. Exactly what color are your eyes? Hazel-ish? Blue-gray-green? Blue with brown spots? Green with gray spots? Most of us are taught in high school biology that two blue-eyed parents are guaranteed to have blue-eyed kids, but it’s not that straightforward. The genetics of eye color is very complicated. All blue eyes are not created equal because eye color is determined by many different gene combinations, as seen in the image below:   The colored part of the eye is called the iris. The iris has pigmentation that determines the eye color. Irises are classified as being one of six colors: amber, blue, brown, gray, green, hazel, or red. Often confused with hazel eyes, amber eyes tend to be a solid golden or copper color without flecks of blue or green typical of hazel eyes.   Blue eyes have a low level of pigment present in the iris. Recently,  scientists announced that everyone with blue eyes is related! Because of various racial groups intermarrying, blue eyes, which are generally recessive, are becoming rarer and rarer. (Note: I recently asked my blue-eyed in-laws how they produced my amber-eyed spouse, incorrectly telling them it was genetically impossible. Lesson #381: it’s not funny to suggest your mother-in-law was unfaithful.)   Brown is the most common eye color. Individuals with brown eyes have more melanin present, and over half of the people in the world have brown eyes.  Gray eyes may be called “blue” at first glance, but they tend to have flecks of gold and brown. And they may appear to “change color” from gray to blue to green depending on clothing, lighting, and mood (which may change the size of the pupil, compressing the colors of the iris).    Green is the least common eye color, but it is found most frequently in northern and central Europe. I have always incorrectly called this color eye hazel!    Hazel eyes mostly consist of shades of brown and green. Much like gray eyes, hazel eyes may appear to “change color” from green to light brown to gold. Individuals whose eyes appear to be one color closest to the pupil, another color a little farther our, and another color around the edge of the iris are likely to have hazel eyes.   Red eyes do exist. “Red?” you say. “Yes, red,” I say, although we often call them pink. Picture white bunnies with pink eyes. What you’re actually seeing in these rabbits and in albinos is the blood vessels behind the iris. Because there is so little melanin in the eyes, there is nothing to conceal the blood vessels hard at work. These red eyes are different from the red eyes you sometimes see in photographs when a flash is used. The red you see in pictures is a reflection of the flash off of the back of the eye, which is filled with blood vessels.   If you’re dissatisfied with your eye color for whatever reason, there are always colored contacts. Just be sure to get a prescription for them from your eye doctor at  Eye Doctors of Washington . Don’t buy them online or borrow them from a friend—you’d just be begging for an eye infection.   « Next Post  Previous Post »         Categories   Astigmatism   Cataract Surgery   Cataracts   Contoura Vision   Cosmetic   EDOWs' Blog   Eye Care   Eye Conditions   Farsighted   General Eye Care   Glaucoma   LASIK   Nearsighted   Practice News   Presbyopia   Press Releases   PRK   RLE   Technology       Book an Appointment     Subscribe to Our Newsletter  Receive Exclusive Promotions & Discounts in Your Inbox.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown.

Male with Hazel Eye Color Hazel Eyes Female WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF HAZEL EYES? You may be curious about the science behind hazel colored eyes. In a nutshell, your eye color is a function of heredity and genetics. The two primary factors that influence eye color are: 1) pigmentation of the iris and 2) how light scatters around the iris. Your eye pigmentation can run a virtual rainbow, from the darkest color of green to the lightest color of blue. A substance called melanin largely influences what color your eyes will ultimately be. Melanin is a complex polymer made from an amino acid called tyrosine . If you have haze eyes, it is because of a phenomenon Rayleigh scattering. In non-science speak, Rayleigh scattering is nothing more than a presentation of how light scatters over an object after riding its spectrum wavelength. Related:  Amber eyes: Learn all about this gold eye color A lot of folks think that eye color is a function of the iris but in truth, it’s not. The unique eye color you have, such as hazel, is the direct result of how light breaks up across melanin’s base. This is not something you can manipulate and is determined by genetics. Science of Hazel Eyes in People  Melanin content in eye color of people with hazel, brown, blue, violet and grey and black eyes Eye Color Melanin Amount:  Front Layer of Iris Melanin Amount: Back Layer of Iris Dominant Pigmentation Hazel Medium: Less than green. More than brown Normal Eumelanin and Pheomelanin Brown Substantial Normal Eumelanin Blue Light Normal Eumelanin Green Closer to blue; less than brown Normal Pheomelanin Grey Less than green and hazel Normal Eumelanin mix Violet/Purple Small to none Small to little Unknown Black Heavy Heavy Black Eumelanin Credit: Wikicommons HOW PEOPLE GET HAZEL EYES The current research in the field of genetics suggests that eye color is largely determined by 16 genes that are passed on to you through heredity. This new theory does away with what scientists used to think – which basically stated that your hazel eyes (or any other eye color) happened because of a dominant gene. HAZEL EYES AND RACE Hazel colored eyes, including shades of brown/green and green/blue , have been part of the genetic sequencing of certain races for thousands of years – maybe even millions. If you are Spanish, Middle Eastern, Brazilian or North African decent, there is a higher likelihood of hazel eyes running in your family tree. This does not preclude other races from having hazel eyes however; any population group can have hazel eyes. Jesse Metcalfe has hazel color eyes CAN EYE COLOR BE CHANGED? Many people are curious if eye color can be changed. The answer is yes and no. The “Yes” part relates to how your eye color will naturally change as a result of how light scatters across the iris. The “No” part has to do with the clinical presentation of eye color. You either have hazel eyes or you don’t. You can’t “inject” something into the iris to make them permanently darker, lighter, greener or bluer. HOW HEALTH IMPACTS EYE COLOR Over the course of your lifetime, your eye color may change as a result of age and health. And you should know the color of your eye can permanently change because of the medical condition known as ocular glaucoma. If you have hazel colored eyes, make sure you visit with your eye doctor regularly because you can lose that color as a result of glaucoma degradation. Jade and Hazel are amazing colors for eyes HAZEL EYES: HEALTH ISSUES People with hazel eyes are susceptible to the harmful effects of our sun.

Depending upon sunlight, your health and atmospheric conditions, some people may experience your hazel colored eyes as bright green, seaweed amber, dazzling emerald or even grey. Here are some of the primary factors influencing hazel eye color intensity: Time of day: Light from the celestial orb we call the sun has a major impact on eye color hew and intensity as expressed through the solar spectrum . Lighting conditions: If you are indoors, the lightbulbs you use to create artificial light can impact how your eyes appear to others. Some shades of hazel become amplified indoors while others do not. Clothing: Depending upon the type of clothing you are wearing, the intensity of your eye color can become stronger and weaker. Colors like gold, blue and various greens can give your hazel eyes a deeper appearance. Makeup for hazel eyes: One of the most powerful ways your hazel eyes can “pop” when others look at them relates to the type of makeup you are wearing. Generally speaking, chocolate or brown eye shadow is recommended for hazel green eyes. Allergies: If you suffer from seasonal allergies, your eye color can experience changes in general intensity. You may take on a reddish hew around the white of the eyeball. Allergies also can cause your eyes to look baggy and puffy . Drugs/Alcohol: Believe it or not, if you use certain types of medications, illicit drugs or drink alcohol, it can impact how others experience your eye color. Some prescription medications are known to cause changes. Be sure to check with your doctor if you notice any variations in ocular appearance. Your emotions: This one may seem silly but if you are sad, crying, happy, joyous or in any way overwhelmed with emotions, the intensity of those hazel eyes you see can change.

Renee Andrews  says:   January 27, 2016 at 9:42 pm  Thanks!   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:28 pm  Same people say I’m creepy because my eye colour changes (I have hazel eyes)   phoenix  says:   January 30, 2016 at 12:54 am  I have hazel eyes. They are mostly green with yellow cloudy poofs all around them. I hate them. They look yellow or green depending on the light and my family loves it because im the only one in our known lineage with this mutation. But I cant for the life of me find any good makeup tutorials and I dont even like my eyes much.   Rachel  says:   July 5, 2016 at 5:11 pm  Aww. That’s terrible. The eyes are the windows to the soul. Your eye color is definitely not a mutation or a curse. I am sure they are beautiful and engaging.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:19 pm  I go with purple or brown/purple shades and they look awesome. Don’t do blue. Always go for a natural looking contrast to the main color of your eyes.   Alexandria  says:   March 20, 2016 at 6:28 am  I have hazle eyes! – they’re a dark gray/blue rim on the outside then followed by a forest green after that and have a gold/brown near the pupils. Their very unique…even my twins eyes are different! I am a girl and he is a boy though!   Theescapefromreality  says:   May 21, 2016 at 11:57 am  What colour is my eyes? Some say my eyes are hazel, some say green and some say both? Help ????   Arthur Kirkland  says:   October 14, 2016 at 11:23 am  They are hazel as they have another colour with the green   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 23, 2016 at 7:26 pm  Your eyes are not hazel, but rather you have a genetic mutation called Central Heterochromia – commonly confused with hazel eyes. Your eyes lack a blue limbal ring, that those with hazel eyes almost always have.   Cristian Grothaus Peyrot  says:   October 23, 2016 at 9:38 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/690baf7a69f2ef1120f12685b7a77929f3881497099257edb98f43694c1e53c0.jpg What about my eyes?   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 25, 2016 at 12:13 am  I’d say you have hazel eyes. 🙂 Although it’s hard to see from the photo, it looks like you have a very faint band of green around the brown in the middle. Followed by a ring of blue, then brown, then blue again. So hazel. Very intriguing hazel eyes, might I add.   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 25, 2016 at 12:31 am  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/29fc4170e2cca4e749a64adcc0afdb7136eecc55b5925a7ac546ecfc9b303d5a.png Just to give an example of an iris with Central Heterochromia, here is a picture of my eye.   Cristian Grothaus Peyrot  says:   October 25, 2016 at 3:49 pm  Well, thanks for your reply, that’s the best photo that I have, anyway How my eyes looks depends totally on the amount of light, at night normally they look more brown and in the daylight I’ve been told that they were green, turquoise or even gray somehow.   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 26, 2016 at 11:00 am  You’re welcome. That is a characteristic trait of hazel eyes – appearing to change colour. That’s due to their medium levels of melanin, so depending on the lighting, what you’re wearing etc… they can appear to be different colours.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:18 pm  Very pretty.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:17 pm  Whoa, beautiful eyes!   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:17 pm  Very pretty.   Malcolm Brown  says:   June 21, 2016 at 1:00 pm  It’s not Melatonin, it’s Melanin. Good article though.   shrugger  says:   July 4, 2016 at 8:24 pm  Mine have gradually changed color as I’ve aged. Blue was more dominant till my mid 20’s. But the yellow center is now dominant in my 40’s.   Rachel  says:   July 5, 2016 at 5:08 pm  I’m with you on that one, Renee. And when my now husband and I were just starting to get to know each other, I seriously thought he did not know what color my eyes are. I asked him  one day and he said, ‘that’s a trick question. They change all the time!’ Oddly enough, sometimes my eyes will be two different colors and that’s really weird. Like one will be totally blue and the other more green. Normally, the base color is a mix of light and dark green, with a goldish center and a grey-blue ring round the outside. My eye doctor actually said that hazel is not a true color, but rather a blend of other colors, and only people with hazel eyes will have the dark ring in contrast with the color. I have to say though, my eyes are my best and favorite feature. 🙂   Kate Dowdeswell  says:   August 5, 2016 at 2:35 pm  Eeeerm I’m really sorry but I am literally unable to stop myself correcting shit. In the article above, they have mistakenly written melatonin instead of melanin. As far as I’m aware melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone which helps people relax before going to sleep in the evening. People suffering from ADHD have a lacking amount of this hormone and can be prescribed melatonin tablets to help them sleep. Melanin is the substance that affects eye and skin colourations.   Fire Shadow  says:   September 11, 2016 at 10:39 pm  A lot of people have been saying that my eyes are green/brown, but some people say they will sometimes change. Are they hazel?   Arthur Kirkland  says:   October 14, 2016 at 1:50 am  I have hazel eyes, i have brown around my pupil and yellow/green on the outer and i have a dark ring surrounding it. my father has brown eyes with a blue ring around them, my mother has the same eyes as i do but unlike mine that look greener in the light theirs looks brown and in dim light mine look brown and theirs looks hazel and my siblings have brown eyes (my eldest sister wears contacts)   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:30 pm  My mum has blue eyes and my dad has brown eyes. I was born with blue eyes but they have now turned hazel   kiLLer Z  says:   October 14, 2016 at 11:57 am  Is  this one Hazel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/41ff8058d80cb6b5773d2211ea4cff344d9a5dcfde042841946dac012a427ba3.jpg   Ham  says:   February 18, 2017 at 12:52 pm  Well there is some sort of green. My sister’s eyes are similar. Once she  is in the sun the Green really pops out. Mine look bit greener in general, but in the Sun her eyes have a more intensiv green. So jap it could be possible ^^   Ham  says:   February 18, 2017 at 1:40 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/037d168c29b929568f81bf28ad7849d22f44fd1eafdbfeb296bb627106b0e76b.jpg With a flash-light my eyes look like this btw.   Sarus Drake  says:   November 6, 2016 at 6:57 pm  I have golden hazel eyes and people have always been drawn to them. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been complimented on them. Though it gets a little strange when total strangers tell you how your eyes are so dark gold and so beautiful when your 9. To be honest, I thought about getting colored contacts and going with brown for a while. But I’ve chosen to embrace my eyes and love the color.

To be honest, I thought about getting colored contacts and going with brown for a while. But I’ve chosen to embrace my eyes and love the color. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/317aec00f36b4e7914ee003a98b63bb0aaca6c706a6ff508354df6b61ae9bedd.jpg   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:15 pm  I used to get called “witch” and “cateyes” in high school.

Always thought I had brown eyes that changed colours because my mom has brown eyes and my dad had green eyes. Then I read something about eye colours a few years ago, and apparently it doesn’t work that way. My eyes usually change depending on the light, on how I feel (if I cry they turn completely green), and what colours I’m wearing.  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/726c78c762aa5e2bb7773b71fefc80e296e62dd81bf0e57c819c65fac9eada60.png   ShadowOfCicero  says:   March 28, 2017 at 9:08 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0ec9c04e6f29d366fc7299b42230397ddc5079f2a5b6e8dad31f80efb73ca026.png These are my eyes with the flash on. The little white square is flash. A lot of people tell me that I have green— and I’d much prefer them to be such, in my own personal opinion— although I believe it’s hazel.

Eye Color          Back to Eye Color           English   Español       Has any progress been made in explaining eye colors other than brown, blue, and green? I've seen dozens of explanations of how the gey (EYCL 1) and bey2 (EYCL 3) genes are supposed to work, all with the disclaimer that this model doesn't explain colors such as hazel, grey, or black (not to mention violet, yellow, or very pale blue). Are the pigments responsible for some of these colors thought to be related to specific genes? Can there be more than two alleles for a gene, such as green, hazel, or blue? Has anybody studied the heritability of unusual eye colors?        -A curious adult from West Virginia   June 23, 2005  Unfortunately, very little work has been done on eye colors other than blue, green, and brown. For this answer, I'll focus on where hazel eyes might fit into the picture. I think once you read this over, you'll get a good feel for how quickly genetics can get too complicated to figure out easily.  So why don't we know more about the genetics of hazel eyes? Part of the reason comes from the difficulty of defining hazel. In other words, when is hazel actually brown? Or green?  People are working on coming up with ways to more precisely define these different eye colors. Hopefully they won't open up a whole new can of worms by giving us a bunch of new eye colors (brown-hazel, hazel, green-hazel, etc.).  Another reason is that the inheritance must be pretty tricky. It must not be as "simple" as blue, green, and brown eyes.  So how might something like hazel eyes work? No one knows for sure but I'll discuss some possibilities. But before that, it is important to go into a little detail about eye color.  Brown, green and blue eye color comes from a pigment called melanin. Brown eyes have a lot of melanin in the iris, green eyes have less, and blue eyes have little or no pigment.  Two genes, bey2 and gey , work together to make brown, green, or blue eyes. Each gene comes in two versions or alleles.  One form of bey2 makes lots of melanin (and is usually referred to as B ) while the other form makes only a little ( b ). One form of gey makes some melanin ( G ) while the other makes only a little ( b ).  So how do you get eye color from all of this? If you have B you get brown eyes, G but no B , green eyes and if you only have b , then you get blue eyes.  Most likely, hazel eyes simply have more melanin than green eyes but less than brown eyes. There are lots of ways to get this level of melanin genetically.  It may be that hazel eyes are the result of genes different from gey and bey2 . Something like hey for hazel. And maybe hey is a bit like bey2 and gey in that it comes in two forms -- one that makes enough melanin for hazel eyes ( H ) and one that makes little or no melanin ( b ).  If this were true, the scheme for eye color would have to be changed. In the new scheme, you would have brown eyes if you had B , hazel eyes if you had H but not B , green eyes if you had G but not H or B and blue eyes if you only had b .  My gut tells me this probably isn't the answer. Even though this sounds pretty complex, it seems like it wouldn't be that much harder to tease out than green and brown eyes. So it is probably something else.  Another possibility is a variation on this theme. Maybe hazel eyes come from different versions of bey2 or gey . I said at the outset that there were two versions of each gene. But what if there were more? What if there were many versions that result in the various shades of color we see?  This is certainly plausible and some recent research suggests that this might be part of the story. But again, I'm just not sure. I would think the genetics again would be easy enough that it would have been figured out by now.  Another possibility is that there may be modifier genes. These are genes that would affect how much melanin bey2 or gey make. For example, you could get a gene that has gey make more melanin or bey2 make less. The end result would be hazel eyes.  What might this inheritance pattern look like? Pretty complicated.  Before launching into this, we need to remember one more thing. We have two copies of most of our genes -- one from mom and one from dad. What this means is that there are actually a number of ways of combining genes to end up with various eye colors.  For brown, green, and blue eyes, the possibilities using bey2 and gey are:    Now imagine a modifier gene that can give you hazel eyes by having gey make more melanin. This gene comes in two flavors -- M increases the amount of melanin gey makes and m has no effect.As you can see, it is possible to have brown eyes and have a B and a b version of the bey2 gene. Or green eyes and have a G and a b version of gey . These people are carriers for blue eyes.  OK, so to have hazel eyes you need a G from the gey gene and an M from our modifier gene. M would not give hazel eyes with b . Why? Because b is really a broken version of G -- b makes so little melanin because it doesn't work. M can't fix a gene -- it can only affect how much melanin a working gey gene makes.  So what are the genetic combinations that give various eye colors using M ? To simplify things, we'll ignore bey2 and just concentrate on green, blue, and hazel.    The blue-eyed parent can only give bm to his children and the hazel-eyed parent can only give GM . So, all of their children will be GbMm or hazel-eyed carriers for green and blue eyes. (See below for a more detailed explanation of where these results came from.)Now we're finally ready to look at some examples of how hazel eyes might be inherited. First, the easiest, a blue-eyed parent with bbmm and a hazel-eyed parent with GGMM .  Let's look at a more interesting example. A blue-eyed parent, bbMM , and a green-eyed parent, GGmm .  This time, the blue-eyed parent can only give bM . The hazel-eyed parent can only give Gm . The end result is all GbMm or hazel eyes! A blue and a green-eyed parent will have all hazel-eyed kids.  This is one of the reasons I like the modifier gene explanation so much. It can help explain how green and blue-eyed parents might have hazel-eyed kids.  Finally, let's tackle a tough one. The faint of heart can skip down to the added links at this point if they want...  Imagine two hazel-eyed parents GbMm . What would their kids look like? For this, we need to bring out the old Punnett square.  The way a Punnett square works is you make a table. You put all the possible gene combinations for the egg on top, and all the gene combinations for sperm on the side. ( Click here for a more detailed explanation of Punnett squares.) For our example, you'd get something like this:    The next step is to match up squares. This will figure out all possible combinations and how likely they'll be.    From this the results are that there is a 4 in 16 chance for blue eyes, a 3 in 16 chance for green and a 9 in 16 chance for hazel. Even though this looks awful, it might be possible to figure things out if this were all that was involved.  Now imagine adding the brown gene to the mix. And another modifier that decreases melanin from bey2 instead of increasing melanin from gey . And now sprinkle in different modifier genes that increase or decrease melanin made by different amounts. And modifier genes that affect the modifier genes. And...  And in reality, eye color may be a result of all of these ideas -- hazel eye color genes, modifier genes, and different versions of bey2 and gey ! As you can see, it all gets complicated pretty quickly. We should be thankful that green, blue, and brown are as simple as they are.

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown. Also, make sure to check out our Freshlook Contact Lenses , which are the most popular, and most widely recommended colored contact lens available.

Please Share!   See also: Brown eyes • All about eye color • Eye color chart • Are green eyes the most attractive? • About blue eyes • Which color contact lenses you should choose • Two different colored eyes (heterochromia)   Hazel eyes are a bit of a mystery.  For starters, people describe this magnificent eye color in many different ways. Some say it looks like hazelnut, while others call it golden or brownish green. One of the reasons it's so hard to describe hazel-colored eyes is that the hue itself seems to change, depending on what you wear and the type of lighting you are in.  To complicate matters further, although hazel eyes appear to contain hues of green, amber and even blue, these color pigments don't exist in the human eye. So where does this stunning color come from?  What Determines Eye Color?  Most of us were taught in high school science class that we inherit our eye color from our parents, and that brown eye color is dominant and blue is recessive (so two parents with blue eyes cannot have a child with brown eyes because neither parent carries the dominant form of the gene for brown eyes).                   Hazel eyes often have a mixture of green, brown and amber hues. Their color can be hard to describe, since ambient lighting and clothing colors can affect your perception of them. [Enlarge]     But it turns out the story is more complicated than that.  More recent research has shown that up to 16 genes (not just one or two) may influence eye color, which makes predicting eye color much more difficult.  Due to variations in the interaction and expression of multiple genes, it's hard to say for sure what color a child's eyes will be based on the color of his or her parents' eyes. For example, we now know it's possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a child with brown eyes  something the old model of eye color inheritance would have deemed impossible.

Also, eye color can change dramatically in the first few years of life; many white, non-Hispanic babies are born with blue eyes and then develop brown, green or hazel eyes in childhood. This phenomenon has little to do with genetics, but it does help explain where hazel eyes come from.  What Causes Hazel Eyes?  The pigmented structure inside the eye that surrounds the pupil and gives eyes their color is called the iris . The pigment responsible for eye color is called melanin, which also affects skin color.  The reason many white, non-Hispanic babies are born with blue eyes is that they don't have the full amount of melanin present in their irises at birth. In the first few years of life, more melanin often develops in the iris, causing blue eyes to turn green, hazel or brown.  Babies whose eyes turn from blue to brown develop significant amounts of melanin. Those who end up with green eyes or hazel eyes develop a little less.  Babies of African-American, Hispanic and Asian ethnicities usually are born with dark eyes that stay brown throughout life. This is because these individuals naturally have more melanin in their eyes and skin, compared with non-Hispanic whites.     Light Absorption And Scattering  Remember, there are no blue, green or hazel pigments in the eye. Eyes merely have different amounts of melanin, which is dark brown.  So how can a dark brown pigment create blue, green or hazel eyes? This is possible because of two processes:   Melanin in the iris absorbs different wavelengths of light entering the eye.  Light is scattered and reflected by the iris, and some wavelengths (colors) scatter more easily than others.   Eyes with high concentrations of melanin absorb more light entering the eye, so less is scattered and reflected back from the iris. The result is a brown eye color.  In eyes with lower concentrations of melanin, less light is absorbed, and more is scattered and reflected by the iris. Since light rays with shorter wavelengths (blue and green light) scatter more easily than light rays with longer wavelengths (red light), eyes with less light-absorbing melanin appear green or hazel, and eyes with low concentrations of melanin appear blue.  Also, the distribution of melanin can vary in different parts of the iris, causing hazel eyes to appear light brown near the pupil and more green in the periphery of the iris.  Hazel Eyes Are A Work Of Art  Hazel eye color is both complex and magnificent, since its specific features are determined by so many factors  including the amount and distribution of melanin in the iris, how scattering of light by the iris and pigment molecules affects color, and how perception of eye color is influenced by lighting and the color of our clothing and surroundings.  Just as it takes many strokes of the artist's brush to produce a masterpiece, hazel eyes involve the dynamics of several elements to create the unique work of art that's represented in every hazel eye.  If you wear eyeglasses, choose lenses with anti-reflective coating to eliminate distracting reflections in your glasses and allow others to see the beauty of your hazel eye color.  Change Your Eye Color To Hazel  If your eyes aren't naturally hazel, but you've always wanted them to be, you can achieve your wish with color contact lenses. They won't actually change your eye color, of course, just the appearance of it.  Want to try hazel eye color? Ask your eye care professional for a prescription for color contact lenses. [Enlarge]   Contact lenses are available in many colors, so you'll have a choice of several shades of hazel. But it's not simply a matter of choosing a lens color you like; the natural color of your eyes has a role in determining which lenses you should wear.  If you have very light eyes, you might be able to use a lens with an "enhancement tint." This lens has a translucent color that lets some of your natural color show through. It's meant to enhance your natural eye color  to make your light blue eyes a deeper blue, for example  but if your eyes are light enough, you might achieve the hazel you want with an enhancement tint.  More likely, you'll need an "opaque tint." These lenses are designed to mask your natural color with a solid version of the color you desire. They're often used when the color you want to achieve is lighter than your natural color.  An eye care professional can show you various colors and help you make the right choice. Remember, contact lenses are a prescription item, and if you don't already wear contacts, you'll need an eye exam and a prescription before getting them  even if your lenses don't need any corrective power in them.

See also: All about eye color • Eye color chart • Are green eyes the most attractive? • About blue eyes • What causes hazel eyes? • Which color contact lenses you should choose • Two different colored eyes (heterochromia)   Brown eyes are more common worldwide than any other eye color. But the prevalence of brown eyes varies significantly with geography.  Most people living in Africa and Asia have dark brown eyes. Dark brown eye color also is very common in the Middle East. But in Europe, both the prevalence and shade of brown eyes vary significantly from region to region.  In the United States, an estimated 41 percent of the population has brown eyes  including dark brown eyes, light brown eyes and honey brown eyes. If you include hazel eyes (sometimes called hazel brown eyes), the prevalence is even higher.  But the high prevalence doesn't mean all brown eyes look the same. There is plenty of variation in the appearance from person to person, and there are even health advantages to having brown eyes (more about that later).  What Causes Brown Eyes?  Even though there are different eye colors, including less common blue eyes and green eyes , there is only one type of eye color pigment. The amount of this pigment (called melanin) present in the iris of your eye determines the color of your eyes.                   Brown eyes range from dark, coffee-colored brown to light amber or honey brown. The color brown is associated with earth and the natural world, and research suggests people perceive brown-eyed individuals as being more trustworthy. [Enlarge]     Eyes with very little melanin in the iris are blue. Eyes with a bit more melanin are green, hazel or light brown. And those with a high concentration of melanin are medium or dark brown.   Recommended For You      Questions about cataracts?

Get $2 off!     Eye color is an inherited trait. But predicting eye color from your family tree is more difficult than you might expect. In fact, there is evidence that up to 16 genes can influence eye color. So it's very possible for children in the same family to have different eye colors, and eyes that are not the same color as those of their parents. Due to complex variations and interactions of genes, it's hard to say with certainty what color eyes a child might end up with.  Also, the eyes of many Caucasian babies contain very little melanin at birth and will appear blue the first few months of life. But within 12 to 18 months, more melanin can accumulate in the iris, causing eye color to change from blue to green, hazel or brown.  Benefits Of Brown Eyes  If you have brown eyes, you'll be happy to know that researchers have found the higher melanin content in your eyes is associated with a number of health benefits.  People with brown eyes may be less vulnerable to certain diseases. For example, people with brown eyes appear less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration than people with light-colored eyes.     Also, people with brown eyes have a lower risk of type 1 diabetes and melanoma of the eye, compared with individuals with light blue eyes. And research at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London suggests individuals with blue eyes have a higher risk of hearing problems caused by environmental noise pollution compared with coworkers with brown eyes. The study authors felt melanin pigment may help protect nerves in the brain from noise-induced damage.  But it's not all good news for people with brown eyes.  Research conducted at the University of Pittsburgh found that women with dark-colored eyes seemed to experience more pain when giving birth compared with mothers with light-colored eyes. The women with light-colored eyes also had less anxiety, depression, negative thoughts and sleep disturbances than the women with brown eyes.  Also, an Australian study published in American Journal of Ophthalmology found that people with dark brown irises were more likely to develop cataracts than people with lighter-colored eyes. So be sure to wear sunglasses that protect your eyes from UV radiation outdoors if you have brown eyes. (In most cases, polarized sunglasses offer the greatest comfort in bright sunlight.)  Brown Eyes: More Trustworthy?  Did you know that having brown eyes may make you appear more trustworthy?  In research performed in the Czech Republic, university students were asked to look at photographs of 80 fellow students (40 males and 40 females, ages 19 to 26 years). Participants in the study were asked to rate the photographed students for trustworthiness on a 10-point scale.    Actress Taraji P. Henson has brown eyes. [Enlarge] (Photo: Featureflash Photo Agency / Shutterstock.com )  The students who were photographed were told to assume neutral, non-smiling expressions and not to wear any makeup or jewelry. All photos were cropped so that the eyes were always horizontally at the same height with a standard length of neck visible. Only photos of individuals with blue eyes or brown eyes were used in the study. Photos of students with hazel or green eyes were excluded.  Results of the study revealed that people with brown eyes were perceived as significantly more trustworthy than those with blue eyes.  But it's a little more complicated than that.  The researchers found a relationship existed between eye color and face shape, and that the shape of a person's face plays a key role in the perception of trustworthiness.  Brown-eyed faces tended to have a rounder and broader chin, a broader mouth with upward-pointing corners, relatively bigger eyes, and eyebrows closer to each other. In contrast, blue-eyed faces were characterized by a more angular and prominent lower face, a longer chin, a narrower mouth with downward-pointing corners, relatively smaller eyes and rather distant eyebrows.  "Brown-eyed individuals tend to be perceived as more trustworthy than blue-eyed ones," explained the study authors. "But it is not brown eyes that cause this perception. It is the facial morphology linked to brown eyes."  Eye Color Options  Despite the advantages associated with brown eyes, if you'd like to try other eye colors, you can. There is a wide variety of color contacts for brown eyes  and these appearance-changing colored lenses are available even if you don't need correction for nearsightedness , farsightedness or astigmatism . There are even colored contacts for brown eyes that can change the color of your eyes to light blue if that's what you desire.  Not ready for contacts but want to know other ways to make your brown eyes "pop?" If you wear eyeglasses , ask your optician to show you how different frame colors can complement and enhance your brown eyes. Also, choose lenses with anti-reflective coating to help showcase your eye color. AR coating eliminates annoying reflections in your eyeglasses, allowing others to see the beauty and expressiveness of your brown eyes.  Also, spend time with a professional aesthetician to discover the best eyeshadow and makeup for brown eyes. The right choices for you will depend on a number of factors  including your hair color and skin tone as well as the depth of the pigment in your brown eyes.

Please Share!   Human eye color charts once were used to "predict" eye colors of children.  In the most simplified versions of these charts, brown eyes are considered dominant over both blue and green eyes. And green eyes are thought to be dominant over blue eyes .  While these concepts generally are true, the genetics of how eye colors are inherited turn out to be far more complicated than once thought.  You can't simply determine the eye colors of grandparents and parents, then calculate the odds of what color a baby's eyes will be. In fact, you can belong to a family with many generations of brown-eyed individuals and still end up with green or blue eyes.    Eye Color Facts                 Contrary to popular belief, it's also possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.  Eye colors depend on the amount of pigment (melanin) found in the iris and how it is distributed. Light gray-blue eyes contain much less pigment than extremely dark brown eyes. And there are many shades of eye color in between.  SEE ALSO:  What Determines Hazel Eye Color >  Some people are even born with eyes of two different colors, a condition known as heterochromia .

Obviously, the percentage of dark brown eyes found in Asian and African populations will be much higher than in European populations.  And some day, blue may be a rare eye color. This is because more people now select mates outside usual cultural and ethic groups. So when a brown-eyed person marries someone with blue eyes, offspring are more likely to inherit the more dominant brown eyes.

Learn about the study • What causes hazel eyes • All about blue eyes • Is green the most attractive eye color? • Which color contact lenses you should choose   Eye color often is the genetic trait that fascinates parents the most as a child develops. Will the child's eyes be black, brown, blue, gray, green, hazel or some combination of colors?  How a child looks depends on the genetic material each parent contributes to the child. But the parents' genes can mix and match in many different ways. The influences from each parent aren't known until  surprise  after the child is born!  How Eye Color Develops  The colored part of the eye is called the iris , which has pigmentation that determines our eye color.   Her eyes may be blue only temporarily; babies' eyes can change color if the brown pigment melanin develops as they grow.  Human eye color originates with three genes, two of which are well understood. These genes account for the most common colors  green, brown, and blue. Other colors, such as gray, hazel and multiple combinations are not fully understood or explainable at this time.  We used to think of brown being "dominant" and blue being "recessive." But modern science has shown that eye color is not at all that simple.  Also, eye colors don't come out as a blend of the parents' colors, as in mixing paint. Each parent has two pairs of genes on each chromosome . So multiple possibilities exist, depending on how the "Wheel of Fortune" spins.  Dutch researchers have announced they are working on ways to determine eye color of adults with sophisticated DNA analysis that can predict with 90 percent accuracy whether people have brown or blue eyes .  In May 2010, the same researchers said they were closing in on the ability to more accurately predict even variable eye colors via DNA analysis and new understanding of how genetics govern eye color.    Eye Color Poll Results     After collecting 66,493 responses to our eye color poll , we thought it was time to share the results with you:  Green was the winner among our site visitors, but responses were spread pretty well over most of the other shades, too.  Sidebar continued >>   To some, eye color isn't that significant. As someone said on our Facebook page, "All eye colors can be 'the most attractive.' ... Your eye color has to be about you and express the truth of you to others."  Another person posted this comment about eye health being much more important: "The most attractive color is the white of the eye when it is clear and bright, which makes any iris beautiful."  L.S.     Researchers said these discoveries also have implications for forensic investigations at crime scenes where recovered DNA may give clues about the actual appearance of suspects.  Most babies are born with blue eyes that can darken in their first three years. Darkening occurs if melanin , a brown pigment usually not present at birth, develops with age.  Children can have completely different eye colors than either of their parents. But if both parents have brown eyes , it's most likely that their children also will have brown eyes.  The darker colors tend to dominate, so brown tends to win out over green, and green tends to win out over blue.  However, a brown/blue parent mix doesn't automatically produce a brown-eyed child.

Usually this is caused by faulty developmental pigment transport, local trauma either in the womb or shortly after birth or a benign genetic disorder.  Other causes can be inflammation, freckle (diffuse nevus) of the iris and Horner's syndrome .  Having an early eye exam is important to make sure nothing serious is going on  and "nothing serious" is the most common finding.  Changes In Eye Color  The iris is a muscle that expands and contracts to control pupil size. The pupil enlarges in dimmer lighting and grows smaller in brighter lighting. The pupil also shrinks when you focus on near objects, such as a book you are reading.  When the pupil size changes, the pigments in the iris compress or spread apart, changing the eye color a bit.  Certain emotions can change both the pupil size and the iris color. That's why some people say their eyes change colors when they're angry or loving.     Eye color also can change with age. This happens in 10 to 15 percent of the Caucasian population (people who generally have lighter eye colors).  For instance, my once very brown eyes are now hazel, a combination of brown and green. However, some hazel eyes actually get darker with age.  Note that if your adult eye color changes pretty dramatically, or if one eye changes from brown to green or blue to brown (called heterochromia ), it's important to see your eye doctor . Eye color changes can be a warning sign of certain diseases, such as Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis, Horner's syndrome or pigmentary glaucoma .  Ultimately, if you don't like the eye color you inherited, you can always change it with colored contact lenses . But remember, even colored contact lenses are a prescription medical device and must be prescribed and monitored by an eye doctor. Don't buy them over the Internet or get them from a friend without having an eye doctor's prescription!    Genes and Eye Color     What Color Will Your Baby's Eyes Be?  How eye color is inherited is far more complicated than what was thought back in the days when simple charts were created that supposedly could predict the eye color of children based on the eye color of their parents.  Generally, though, it's far more likely for two brown-eyed parents to have a blue-eyed child than for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child. This is because the generally less dominant blue-eyed trait can be passed along by brown-eyed people until the genes for the lighter eye color happen to match up, possibly many generations later.  Two blue-eyed parents, on the other hand, are much less likely to have darker-eyed children. This is because darker eyes generally are so much more dominant that the genetic trait, when present, ordinarily would first show up in the parent, who then wouldn't be blue-eyed at all.  Still, due to the complexities of how genetic traits are passed along, it is entirely possible for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child.    Eyewear To Enhance Your Eye Color  If you wear eyeglasses, be sure to choose lenses with anti-reflective (AR) coating . AR-coated lenses eliminate annoying reflections in your glasses that prevent others from seeing the beauty and expressiveness of your eyes. Ask your optician for details and a demonstration.  Also, read about how to choose eyeglass frames that highlight and enhance the color of your eyes and skin tone.

That’s because hazel eyes are unique, with only a smattering of people around the globe having them. When you consider that 55% of the world’s population has brown eyes, you quickly see that having hazel colored eyes is rare indeed. If you happen to be one of the fortunate few with this green, blue, brown mix, consider yourself to be in a very special club!    Hazel color eyes can be stunning HAZEL EYES DEFINITION Trying to define hazel eyes can be difficult. That’s because shades of green can be light, dark or depending upon the lighting, a mixture of both. This article offers everything you ever wanted to know about hazel eyes. We’ll take a look at how you got your eye color, examine how eye color can be changed and take a look at a few famous celebrities who were born with hazel eyes. We’ll also take a peek at common myths associated with hazel eyes. Other information will be imparted as well, including a video on eye color and a hazel eye poll. Are you ready? Let’s jump right in! Male with Hazel Eye Color Hazel Eyes Female WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF HAZEL EYES? You may be curious about the science behind hazel colored eyes. In a nutshell, your eye color is a function of heredity and genetics. The two primary factors that influence eye color are: 1) pigmentation of the iris and 2) how light scatters around the iris. Your eye pigmentation can run a virtual rainbow, from the darkest color of green to the lightest color of blue. A substance called melanin largely influences what color your eyes will ultimately be. Melanin is a complex polymer made from an amino acid called tyrosine . If you have haze eyes, it is because of a phenomenon Rayleigh scattering. In non-science speak, Rayleigh scattering is nothing more than a presentation of how light scatters over an object after riding its spectrum wavelength. Related:  Amber eyes: Learn all about this gold eye color A lot of folks think that eye color is a function of the iris but in truth, it’s not. The unique eye color you have, such as hazel, is the direct result of how light breaks up across melanin’s base. This is not something you can manipulate and is determined by genetics. Science of Hazel Eyes in People  Melanin content in eye color of people with hazel, brown, blue, violet and grey and black eyes Eye Color Melanin Amount:  Front Layer of Iris Melanin Amount: Back Layer of Iris Dominant Pigmentation Hazel Medium: Less than green. More than brown Normal Eumelanin and Pheomelanin Brown Substantial Normal Eumelanin Blue Light Normal Eumelanin Green Closer to blue; less than brown Normal Pheomelanin Grey Less than green and hazel Normal Eumelanin mix Violet/Purple Small to none Small to little Unknown Black Heavy Heavy Black Eumelanin Credit: Wikicommons HOW PEOPLE GET HAZEL EYES The current research in the field of genetics suggests that eye color is largely determined by 16 genes that are passed on to you through heredity. This new theory does away with what scientists used to think – which basically stated that your hazel eyes (or any other eye color) happened because of a dominant gene. HAZEL EYES AND RACE Hazel colored eyes, including shades of brown/green and green/blue , have been part of the genetic sequencing of certain races for thousands of years – maybe even millions. If you are Spanish, Middle Eastern, Brazilian or North African decent, there is a higher likelihood of hazel eyes running in your family tree. This does not preclude other races from having hazel eyes however; any population group can have hazel eyes. Jesse Metcalfe has hazel color eyes CAN EYE COLOR BE CHANGED? Many people are curious if eye color can be changed. The answer is yes and no. The “Yes” part relates to how your eye color will naturally change as a result of how light scatters across the iris. The “No” part has to do with the clinical presentation of eye color. You either have hazel eyes or you don’t. You can’t “inject” something into the iris to make them permanently darker, lighter, greener or bluer. HOW HEALTH IMPACTS EYE COLOR Over the course of your lifetime, your eye color may change as a result of age and health. And you should know the color of your eye can permanently change because of the medical condition known as ocular glaucoma. If you have hazel colored eyes, make sure you visit with your eye doctor regularly because you can lose that color as a result of glaucoma degradation. Jade and Hazel are amazing colors for eyes HAZEL EYES: HEALTH ISSUES People with hazel eyes are susceptible to the harmful effects of our sun. The primary reason is connected to the substance we discussed earlier, melanin. People with hazel eyes can develop certain types of ocular cancers , like intra-ocular melanoma. It is suggested that people with hazel colored eyes and other eye colors for that matter wear sunglasses that offer strong UV protection. Hazel eyes often combine different eye colors   HAZEL EYES: MIX OF GREEN, BROWN AND BLUE No two pair of hazel eyes is exactly the same. Some people have lighter features of green while others have darker features of brown. Ocular scientists think hazel eye color is a combination of greens, browns and blues but if truth be told, they aren’t exactly sure. We do know however, that hazel is considered rare. Hazel Eyes Channing Tatum HAZEL EYES AND INTENSITY CHANGES The intensity of the color people see when they look into your hazel eyes is influenced by a number of factors. Depending upon sunlight, your health and atmospheric conditions, some people may experience your hazel colored eyes as bright green, seaweed amber, dazzling emerald or even grey. Here are some of the primary factors influencing hazel eye color intensity: Time of day: Light from the celestial orb we call the sun has a major impact on eye color hew and intensity as expressed through the solar spectrum . Lighting conditions: If you are indoors, the lightbulbs you use to create artificial light can impact how your eyes appear to others. Some shades of hazel become amplified indoors while others do not. Clothing: Depending upon the type of clothing you are wearing, the intensity of your eye color can become stronger and weaker. Colors like gold, blue and various greens can give your hazel eyes a deeper appearance. Makeup for hazel eyes: One of the most powerful ways your hazel eyes can “pop” when others look at them relates to the type of makeup you are wearing. Generally speaking, chocolate or brown eye shadow is recommended for hazel green eyes. Allergies: If you suffer from seasonal allergies, your eye color can experience changes in general intensity. You may take on a reddish hew around the white of the eyeball. Allergies also can cause your eyes to look baggy and puffy . Drugs/Alcohol: Believe it or not, if you use certain types of medications, illicit drugs or drink alcohol, it can impact how others experience your eye color. Some prescription medications are known to cause changes. Be sure to check with your doctor if you notice any variations in ocular appearance. Your emotions: This one may seem silly but if you are sad, crying, happy, joyous or in any way overwhelmed with emotions, the intensity of those hazel eyes you see can change. Don’t worry, it’s only temporary. HAZEL EYE MAKEUP TO ENHANCE COLOR This video offers tips to women with hazel colored eyes who are looking for advice on how to enhance their eye color.

Renee Andrews  says:   January 27, 2016 at 9:42 pm  Thanks!   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:28 pm  Same people say I’m creepy because my eye colour changes (I have hazel eyes)   phoenix  says:   January 30, 2016 at 12:54 am  I have hazel eyes. They are mostly green with yellow cloudy poofs all around them. I hate them. They look yellow or green depending on the light and my family loves it because im the only one in our known lineage with this mutation. But I cant for the life of me find any good makeup tutorials and I dont even like my eyes much.   Rachel  says:   July 5, 2016 at 5:11 pm  Aww. That’s terrible. The eyes are the windows to the soul. Your eye color is definitely not a mutation or a curse. I am sure they are beautiful and engaging.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:19 pm  I go with purple or brown/purple shades and they look awesome. Don’t do blue. Always go for a natural looking contrast to the main color of your eyes.   Alexandria  says:   March 20, 2016 at 6:28 am  I have hazle eyes! – they’re a dark gray/blue rim on the outside then followed by a forest green after that and have a gold/brown near the pupils. Their very unique…even my twins eyes are different! I am a girl and he is a boy though!   Theescapefromreality  says:   May 21, 2016 at 11:57 am  What colour is my eyes? Some say my eyes are hazel, some say green and some say both? Help ????   Arthur Kirkland  says:   October 14, 2016 at 11:23 am  They are hazel as they have another colour with the green   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 23, 2016 at 7:26 pm  Your eyes are not hazel, but rather you have a genetic mutation called Central Heterochromia – commonly confused with hazel eyes. Your eyes lack a blue limbal ring, that those with hazel eyes almost always have.   Cristian Grothaus Peyrot  says:   October 23, 2016 at 9:38 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/690baf7a69f2ef1120f12685b7a77929f3881497099257edb98f43694c1e53c0.jpg What about my eyes?   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 25, 2016 at 12:13 am  I’d say you have hazel eyes. 🙂 Although it’s hard to see from the photo, it looks like you have a very faint band of green around the brown in the middle. Followed by a ring of blue, then brown, then blue again. So hazel. Very intriguing hazel eyes, might I add.   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 25, 2016 at 12:31 am  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/29fc4170e2cca4e749a64adcc0afdb7136eecc55b5925a7ac546ecfc9b303d5a.png Just to give an example of an iris with Central Heterochromia, here is a picture of my eye.   Cristian Grothaus Peyrot  says:   October 25, 2016 at 3:49 pm  Well, thanks for your reply, that’s the best photo that I have, anyway How my eyes looks depends totally on the amount of light, at night normally they look more brown and in the daylight I’ve been told that they were green, turquoise or even gray somehow.   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 26, 2016 at 11:00 am  You’re welcome. That is a characteristic trait of hazel eyes – appearing to change colour. That’s due to their medium levels of melanin, so depending on the lighting, what you’re wearing etc… they can appear to be different colours.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:18 pm  Very pretty.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:17 pm  Whoa, beautiful eyes!   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:17 pm  Very pretty.   Malcolm Brown  says:   June 21, 2016 at 1:00 pm  It’s not Melatonin, it’s Melanin. Good article though.   shrugger  says:   July 4, 2016 at 8:24 pm  Mine have gradually changed color as I’ve aged. Blue was more dominant till my mid 20’s. But the yellow center is now dominant in my 40’s.   Rachel  says:   July 5, 2016 at 5:08 pm  I’m with you on that one, Renee. And when my now husband and I were just starting to get to know each other, I seriously thought he did not know what color my eyes are. I asked him  one day and he said, ‘that’s a trick question. They change all the time!’ Oddly enough, sometimes my eyes will be two different colors and that’s really weird. Like one will be totally blue and the other more green. Normally, the base color is a mix of light and dark green, with a goldish center and a grey-blue ring round the outside. My eye doctor actually said that hazel is not a true color, but rather a blend of other colors, and only people with hazel eyes will have the dark ring in contrast with the color. I have to say though, my eyes are my best and favorite feature. 🙂   Kate Dowdeswell  says:   August 5, 2016 at 2:35 pm  Eeeerm I’m really sorry but I am literally unable to stop myself correcting shit. In the article above, they have mistakenly written melatonin instead of melanin. As far as I’m aware melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone which helps people relax before going to sleep in the evening. People suffering from ADHD have a lacking amount of this hormone and can be prescribed melatonin tablets to help them sleep. Melanin is the substance that affects eye and skin colourations.   Fire Shadow  says:   September 11, 2016 at 10:39 pm  A lot of people have been saying that my eyes are green/brown, but some people say they will sometimes change. Are they hazel?   Arthur Kirkland  says:   October 14, 2016 at 1:50 am  I have hazel eyes, i have brown around my pupil and yellow/green on the outer and i have a dark ring surrounding it. my father has brown eyes with a blue ring around them, my mother has the same eyes as i do but unlike mine that look greener in the light theirs looks brown and in dim light mine look brown and theirs looks hazel and my siblings have brown eyes (my eldest sister wears contacts)   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:30 pm  My mum has blue eyes and my dad has brown eyes. I was born with blue eyes but they have now turned hazel   kiLLer Z  says:   October 14, 2016 at 11:57 am  Is  this one Hazel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/41ff8058d80cb6b5773d2211ea4cff344d9a5dcfde042841946dac012a427ba3.jpg   Ham  says:   February 18, 2017 at 12:52 pm  Well there is some sort of green. My sister’s eyes are similar. Once she  is in the sun the Green really pops out. Mine look bit greener in general, but in the Sun her eyes have a more intensiv green. So jap it could be possible ^^   Ham  says:   February 18, 2017 at 1:40 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/037d168c29b929568f81bf28ad7849d22f44fd1eafdbfeb296bb627106b0e76b.jpg With a flash-light my eyes look like this btw.   Sarus Drake  says:   November 6, 2016 at 6:57 pm  I have golden hazel eyes and people have always been drawn to them. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been complimented on them. Though it gets a little strange when total strangers tell you how your eyes are so dark gold and so beautiful when your 9. To be honest, I thought about getting colored contacts and going with brown for a while. But I’ve chosen to embrace my eyes and love the color.

Always thought I had brown eyes that changed colours because my mom has brown eyes and my dad had green eyes. Then I read something about eye colours a few years ago, and apparently it doesn’t work that way. My eyes usually change depending on the light, on how I feel (if I cry they turn completely green), and what colours I’m wearing.  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/726c78c762aa5e2bb7773b71fefc80e296e62dd81bf0e57c819c65fac9eada60.png   ShadowOfCicero  says:   March 28, 2017 at 9:08 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0ec9c04e6f29d366fc7299b42230397ddc5079f2a5b6e8dad31f80efb73ca026.png These are my eyes with the flash on. The little white square is flash. A lot of people tell me that I have green— and I’d much prefer them to be such, in my own personal opinion— although I believe it’s hazel. It’s blue with a green-brown although it rarely appears blue. Technically: Hazel. Appears: Green. Thoughts?

It appears like this most of time, although they look brown from a distance.   Sonya Marlene Tanner  says:   April 11, 2017 at 4:48 pm  Here are my eyes. They are green with a small amount of amber in them. Didn’t know if I had hazel eyes or not. They look more green than they do amber, and they change color depending on the lighting and atmosphere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/36befd90295cd0fdd09d36f9a746f925ff447ca54e19c7be4da419aac97c8423.jpg  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ea9185f718d9c8acb45b05614b387ac29faa59316284c90477f61931623af7ce.png   Ruby  says:   April 12, 2017 at 1:19 am  I have no idea what colour my eyes are, most people say they are brown where as other people say they are hazel.

My sisters were brown for 56 of her years but a week ago I noticed they were hazel, like mine. I asked her what, how, when and she said she didn’t know, she noticed a couple months ago that they had changed but she didn’t know how or why. She’s a professional, doesn’t smoke, drink or do drugs. I came to this site looking for answers. Does anyone have one?   John D.

Posted on August 25, 2010 in General Eye Care  When someone wants to enhance their vision, they may try contact lenses or seek out LASIK eye surgery . But what if they want to change the color of their eyes? People have long been fascinated with eye color; after all, eyes come in a wide range of shades. Exactly what color are your eyes? Hazel-ish? Blue-gray-green? Blue with brown spots? Green with gray spots? Most of us are taught in high school biology that two blue-eyed parents are guaranteed to have blue-eyed kids, but it’s not that straightforward. The genetics of eye color is very complicated. All blue eyes are not created equal because eye color is determined by many different gene combinations, as seen in the image below:   The colored part of the eye is called the iris. The iris has pigmentation that determines the eye color. Irises are classified as being one of six colors: amber, blue, brown, gray, green, hazel, or red. Often confused with hazel eyes, amber eyes tend to be a solid golden or copper color without flecks of blue or green typical of hazel eyes.   Blue eyes have a low level of pigment present in the iris. Recently,  scientists announced that everyone with blue eyes is related! Because of various racial groups intermarrying, blue eyes, which are generally recessive, are becoming rarer and rarer. (Note: I recently asked my blue-eyed in-laws how they produced my amber-eyed spouse, incorrectly telling them it was genetically impossible. Lesson #381: it’s not funny to suggest your mother-in-law was unfaithful.)   Brown is the most common eye color. Individuals with brown eyes have more melanin present, and over half of the people in the world have brown eyes.  Gray eyes may be called “blue” at first glance, but they tend to have flecks of gold and brown. And they may appear to “change color” from gray to blue to green depending on clothing, lighting, and mood (which may change the size of the pupil, compressing the colors of the iris).    Green is the least common eye color, but it is found most frequently in northern and central Europe. I have always incorrectly called this color eye hazel!    Hazel eyes mostly consist of shades of brown and green. Much like gray eyes, hazel eyes may appear to “change color” from green to light brown to gold. Individuals whose eyes appear to be one color closest to the pupil, another color a little farther our, and another color around the edge of the iris are likely to have hazel eyes.   Red eyes do exist. “Red?” you say. “Yes, red,” I say, although we often call them pink. Picture white bunnies with pink eyes. What you’re actually seeing in these rabbits and in albinos is the blood vessels behind the iris. Because there is so little melanin in the eyes, there is nothing to conceal the blood vessels hard at work. These red eyes are different from the red eyes you sometimes see in photographs when a flash is used. The red you see in pictures is a reflection of the flash off of the back of the eye, which is filled with blood vessels.   If you’re dissatisfied with your eye color for whatever reason, there are always colored contacts. Just be sure to get a prescription for them from your eye doctor at  Eye Doctors of Washington . Don’t buy them online or borrow them from a friend—you’d just be begging for an eye infection.   « Next Post  Previous Post »         Categories   Astigmatism   Cataract Surgery   Cataracts   Contoura Vision   Cosmetic   EDOWs' Blog   Eye Care   Eye Conditions   Farsighted   General Eye Care   Glaucoma   LASIK   Nearsighted   Practice News   Presbyopia   Press Releases   PRK   RLE   Technology       Book an Appointment     Subscribe to Our Newsletter  Receive Exclusive Promotions & Discounts in Your Inbox.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown.

Male with Hazel Eye Color Hazel Eyes Female WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF HAZEL EYES? You may be curious about the science behind hazel colored eyes. In a nutshell, your eye color is a function of heredity and genetics. The two primary factors that influence eye color are: 1) pigmentation of the iris and 2) how light scatters around the iris. Your eye pigmentation can run a virtual rainbow, from the darkest color of green to the lightest color of blue. A substance called melanin largely influences what color your eyes will ultimately be. Melanin is a complex polymer made from an amino acid called tyrosine . If you have haze eyes, it is because of a phenomenon Rayleigh scattering. In non-science speak, Rayleigh scattering is nothing more than a presentation of how light scatters over an object after riding its spectrum wavelength. Related:  Amber eyes: Learn all about this gold eye color A lot of folks think that eye color is a function of the iris but in truth, it’s not. The unique eye color you have, such as hazel, is the direct result of how light breaks up across melanin’s base. This is not something you can manipulate and is determined by genetics. Science of Hazel Eyes in People  Melanin content in eye color of people with hazel, brown, blue, violet and grey and black eyes Eye Color Melanin Amount:  Front Layer of Iris Melanin Amount: Back Layer of Iris Dominant Pigmentation Hazel Medium: Less than green. More than brown Normal Eumelanin and Pheomelanin Brown Substantial Normal Eumelanin Blue Light Normal Eumelanin Green Closer to blue; less than brown Normal Pheomelanin Grey Less than green and hazel Normal Eumelanin mix Violet/Purple Small to none Small to little Unknown Black Heavy Heavy Black Eumelanin Credit: Wikicommons HOW PEOPLE GET HAZEL EYES The current research in the field of genetics suggests that eye color is largely determined by 16 genes that are passed on to you through heredity. This new theory does away with what scientists used to think – which basically stated that your hazel eyes (or any other eye color) happened because of a dominant gene. HAZEL EYES AND RACE Hazel colored eyes, including shades of brown/green and green/blue , have been part of the genetic sequencing of certain races for thousands of years – maybe even millions. If you are Spanish, Middle Eastern, Brazilian or North African decent, there is a higher likelihood of hazel eyes running in your family tree. This does not preclude other races from having hazel eyes however; any population group can have hazel eyes. Jesse Metcalfe has hazel color eyes CAN EYE COLOR BE CHANGED? Many people are curious if eye color can be changed. The answer is yes and no. The “Yes” part relates to how your eye color will naturally change as a result of how light scatters across the iris. The “No” part has to do with the clinical presentation of eye color. You either have hazel eyes or you don’t. You can’t “inject” something into the iris to make them permanently darker, lighter, greener or bluer. HOW HEALTH IMPACTS EYE COLOR Over the course of your lifetime, your eye color may change as a result of age and health. And you should know the color of your eye can permanently change because of the medical condition known as ocular glaucoma. If you have hazel colored eyes, make sure you visit with your eye doctor regularly because you can lose that color as a result of glaucoma degradation.

Hazel Eyes Channing Tatum HAZEL EYES AND INTENSITY CHANGES The intensity of the color people see when they look into your hazel eyes is influenced by a number of factors. Depending upon sunlight, your health and atmospheric conditions, some people may experience your hazel colored eyes as bright green, seaweed amber, dazzling emerald or even grey. Here are some of the primary factors influencing hazel eye color intensity: Time of day: Light from the celestial orb we call the sun has a major impact on eye color hew and intensity as expressed through the solar spectrum . Lighting conditions: If you are indoors, the lightbulbs you use to create artificial light can impact how your eyes appear to others. Some shades of hazel become amplified indoors while others do not. Clothing: Depending upon the type of clothing you are wearing, the intensity of your eye color can become stronger and weaker. Colors like gold, blue and various greens can give your hazel eyes a deeper appearance. Makeup for hazel eyes: One of the most powerful ways your hazel eyes can “pop” when others look at them relates to the type of makeup you are wearing. Generally speaking, chocolate or brown eye shadow is recommended for hazel green eyes. Allergies: If you suffer from seasonal allergies, your eye color can experience changes in general intensity. You may take on a reddish hew around the white of the eyeball. Allergies also can cause your eyes to look baggy and puffy . Drugs/Alcohol: Believe it or not, if you use certain types of medications, illicit drugs or drink alcohol, it can impact how others experience your eye color. Some prescription medications are known to cause changes. Be sure to check with your doctor if you notice any variations in ocular appearance. Your emotions: This one may seem silly but if you are sad, crying, happy, joyous or in any way overwhelmed with emotions, the intensity of those hazel eyes you see can change. Don’t worry, it’s only temporary. HAZEL EYE MAKEUP TO ENHANCE COLOR This video offers tips to women with hazel colored eyes who are looking for advice on how to enhance their eye color.

Here, we are talking about psychic abilities or the power to sense the emotions of others. To date, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. FINAL THOUGHTS ON OLIVE HAZEL There is much we still do not know about eye color, including hazel colored eyes. What we do know is that many people want to change their eye color to hazel or green. In fact, some people have undergone questionable medical procedures in order for this to happen. It’s probably better to get a pair of colored contacted than travel to another country for something risky.  Hopefully, you found the material on this post useful and informative.

Renee Andrews  says:   January 27, 2016 at 9:42 pm  Thanks!   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:28 pm  Same people say I’m creepy because my eye colour changes (I have hazel eyes)   phoenix  says:   January 30, 2016 at 12:54 am  I have hazel eyes. They are mostly green with yellow cloudy poofs all around them. I hate them. They look yellow or green depending on the light and my family loves it because im the only one in our known lineage with this mutation. But I cant for the life of me find any good makeup tutorials and I dont even like my eyes much.   Rachel  says:   July 5, 2016 at 5:11 pm  Aww. That’s terrible. The eyes are the windows to the soul. Your eye color is definitely not a mutation or a curse. I am sure they are beautiful and engaging.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:19 pm  I go with purple or brown/purple shades and they look awesome. Don’t do blue. Always go for a natural looking contrast to the main color of your eyes.   Alexandria  says:   March 20, 2016 at 6:28 am  I have hazle eyes! – they’re a dark gray/blue rim on the outside then followed by a forest green after that and have a gold/brown near the pupils. Their very unique…even my twins eyes are different! I am a girl and he is a boy though!   Theescapefromreality  says:   May 21, 2016 at 11:57 am  What colour is my eyes? Some say my eyes are hazel, some say green and some say both? Help ????   Arthur Kirkland  says:   October 14, 2016 at 11:23 am  They are hazel as they have another colour with the green   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 23, 2016 at 7:26 pm  Your eyes are not hazel, but rather you have a genetic mutation called Central Heterochromia – commonly confused with hazel eyes. Your eyes lack a blue limbal ring, that those with hazel eyes almost always have.   Cristian Grothaus Peyrot  says:   October 23, 2016 at 9:38 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/690baf7a69f2ef1120f12685b7a77929f3881497099257edb98f43694c1e53c0.jpg What about my eyes?   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 25, 2016 at 12:13 am  I’d say you have hazel eyes. 🙂 Although it’s hard to see from the photo, it looks like you have a very faint band of green around the brown in the middle. Followed by a ring of blue, then brown, then blue again. So hazel. Very intriguing hazel eyes, might I add.   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 25, 2016 at 12:31 am  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/29fc4170e2cca4e749a64adcc0afdb7136eecc55b5925a7ac546ecfc9b303d5a.png Just to give an example of an iris with Central Heterochromia, here is a picture of my eye.   Cristian Grothaus Peyrot  says:   October 25, 2016 at 3:49 pm  Well, thanks for your reply, that’s the best photo that I have, anyway How my eyes looks depends totally on the amount of light, at night normally they look more brown and in the daylight I’ve been told that they were green, turquoise or even gray somehow.   Lia Chalmers  says:   October 26, 2016 at 11:00 am  You’re welcome. That is a characteristic trait of hazel eyes – appearing to change colour. That’s due to their medium levels of melanin, so depending on the lighting, what you’re wearing etc… they can appear to be different colours.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:18 pm  Very pretty.   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:17 pm  Whoa, beautiful eyes!   Learning64  says:   January 11, 2017 at 2:17 pm  Very pretty.   Malcolm Brown  says:   June 21, 2016 at 1:00 pm  It’s not Melatonin, it’s Melanin. Good article though.   shrugger  says:   July 4, 2016 at 8:24 pm  Mine have gradually changed color as I’ve aged. Blue was more dominant till my mid 20’s. But the yellow center is now dominant in my 40’s.   Rachel  says:   July 5, 2016 at 5:08 pm  I’m with you on that one, Renee. And when my now husband and I were just starting to get to know each other, I seriously thought he did not know what color my eyes are. I asked him  one day and he said, ‘that’s a trick question. They change all the time!’ Oddly enough, sometimes my eyes will be two different colors and that’s really weird. Like one will be totally blue and the other more green. Normally, the base color is a mix of light and dark green, with a goldish center and a grey-blue ring round the outside. My eye doctor actually said that hazel is not a true color, but rather a blend of other colors, and only people with hazel eyes will have the dark ring in contrast with the color. I have to say though, my eyes are my best and favorite feature. 🙂   Kate Dowdeswell  says:   August 5, 2016 at 2:35 pm  Eeeerm I’m really sorry but I am literally unable to stop myself correcting shit. In the article above, they have mistakenly written melatonin instead of melanin. As far as I’m aware melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone which helps people relax before going to sleep in the evening. People suffering from ADHD have a lacking amount of this hormone and can be prescribed melatonin tablets to help them sleep. Melanin is the substance that affects eye and skin colourations.   Fire Shadow  says:   September 11, 2016 at 10:39 pm  A lot of people have been saying that my eyes are green/brown, but some people say they will sometimes change. Are they hazel?   Arthur Kirkland  says:   October 14, 2016 at 1:50 am  I have hazel eyes, i have brown around my pupil and yellow/green on the outer and i have a dark ring surrounding it. my father has brown eyes with a blue ring around them, my mother has the same eyes as i do but unlike mine that look greener in the light theirs looks brown and in dim light mine look brown and theirs looks hazel and my siblings have brown eyes (my eldest sister wears contacts)   angelina phillips  says:   December 16, 2016 at 6:30 pm  My mum has blue eyes and my dad has brown eyes.

My sister’s eyes are similar. Once she  is in the sun the Green really pops out. Mine look bit greener in general, but in the Sun her eyes have a more intensiv green. So jap it could be possible ^^   Ham  says:   February 18, 2017 at 1:40 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/037d168c29b929568f81bf28ad7849d22f44fd1eafdbfeb296bb627106b0e76b.jpg With a flash-light my eyes look like this btw.   Sarus Drake  says:   November 6, 2016 at 6:57 pm  I have golden hazel eyes and people have always been drawn to them. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been complimented on them. Though it gets a little strange when total strangers tell you how your eyes are so dark gold and so beautiful when your 9. To be honest, I thought about getting colored contacts and going with brown for a while. But I’ve chosen to embrace my eyes and love the color.

Always thought I had brown eyes that changed colours because my mom has brown eyes and my dad had green eyes. Then I read something about eye colours a few years ago, and apparently it doesn’t work that way. My eyes usually change depending on the light, on how I feel (if I cry they turn completely green), and what colours I’m wearing.  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/726c78c762aa5e2bb7773b71fefc80e296e62dd81bf0e57c819c65fac9eada60.png   ShadowOfCicero  says:   March 28, 2017 at 9:08 pm  https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0ec9c04e6f29d366fc7299b42230397ddc5079f2a5b6e8dad31f80efb73ca026.png These are my eyes with the flash on. The little white square is flash. A lot of people tell me that I have green— and I’d much prefer them to be such, in my own personal opinion— although I believe it’s hazel.

I asked her what, how, when and she said she didn’t know, she noticed a couple months ago that they had changed but she didn’t know how or why. She’s a professional, doesn’t smoke, drink or do drugs. I came to this site looking for answers. Does anyone have one?   John D.

Eye Color          Back to Eye Color           English   Español       Has any progress been made in explaining eye colors other than brown, blue, and green? I've seen dozens of explanations of how the gey (EYCL 1) and bey2 (EYCL 3) genes are supposed to work, all with the disclaimer that this model doesn't explain colors such as hazel, grey, or black (not to mention violet, yellow, or very pale blue). Are the pigments responsible for some of these colors thought to be related to specific genes? Can there be more than two alleles for a gene, such as green, hazel, or blue? Has anybody studied the heritability of unusual eye colors?        -A curious adult from West Virginia   June 23, 2005  Unfortunately, very little work has been done on eye colors other than blue, green, and brown. For this answer, I'll focus on where hazel eyes might fit into the picture. I think once you read this over, you'll get a good feel for how quickly genetics can get too complicated to figure out easily.  So why don't we know more about the genetics of hazel eyes? Part of the reason comes from the difficulty of defining hazel. In other words, when is hazel actually brown? Or green?  People are working on coming up with ways to more precisely define these different eye colors. Hopefully they won't open up a whole new can of worms by giving us a bunch of new eye colors (brown-hazel, hazel, green-hazel, etc.).  Another reason is that the inheritance must be pretty tricky. It must not be as "simple" as blue, green, and brown eyes.  So how might something like hazel eyes work? No one knows for sure but I'll discuss some possibilities. But before that, it is important to go into a little detail about eye color.  Brown, green and blue eye color comes from a pigment called melanin. Brown eyes have a lot of melanin in the iris, green eyes have less, and blue eyes have little or no pigment.  Two genes, bey2 and gey , work together to make brown, green, or blue eyes. Each gene comes in two versions or alleles.  One form of bey2 makes lots of melanin (and is usually referred to as B ) while the other form makes only a little ( b ). One form of gey makes some melanin ( G ) while the other makes only a little ( b ).  So how do you get eye color from all of this? If you have B you get brown eyes, G but no B , green eyes and if you only have b , then you get blue eyes.  Most likely, hazel eyes simply have more melanin than green eyes but less than brown eyes. There are lots of ways to get this level of melanin genetically.  It may be that hazel eyes are the result of genes different from gey and bey2 . Something like hey for hazel. And maybe hey is a bit like bey2 and gey in that it comes in two forms -- one that makes enough melanin for hazel eyes ( H ) and one that makes little or no melanin ( b ).  If this were true, the scheme for eye color would have to be changed. In the new scheme, you would have brown eyes if you had B , hazel eyes if you had H but not B , green eyes if you had G but not H or B and blue eyes if you only had b .  My gut tells me this probably isn't the answer. Even though this sounds pretty complex, it seems like it wouldn't be that much harder to tease out than green and brown eyes. So it is probably something else.  Another possibility is a variation on this theme. Maybe hazel eyes come from different versions of bey2 or gey . I said at the outset that there were two versions of each gene. But what if there were more? What if there were many versions that result in the various shades of color we see?  This is certainly plausible and some recent research suggests that this might be part of the story. But again, I'm just not sure. I would think the genetics again would be easy enough that it would have been figured out by now.  Another possibility is that there may be modifier genes. These are genes that would affect how much melanin bey2 or gey make. For example, you could get a gene that has gey make more melanin or bey2 make less. The end result would be hazel eyes.  What might this inheritance pattern look like? Pretty complicated.  Before launching into this, we need to remember one more thing. We have two copies of most of our genes -- one from mom and one from dad. What this means is that there are actually a number of ways of combining genes to end up with various eye colors.  For brown, green, and blue eyes, the possibilities using bey2 and gey are:    Now imagine a modifier gene that can give you hazel eyes by having gey make more melanin. This gene comes in two flavors -- M increases the amount of melanin gey makes and m has no effect.As you can see, it is possible to have brown eyes and have a B and a b version of the bey2 gene. Or green eyes and have a G and a b version of gey . These people are carriers for blue eyes.  OK, so to have hazel eyes you need a G from the gey gene and an M from our modifier gene. M would not give hazel eyes with b . Why? Because b is really a broken version of G -- b makes so little melanin because it doesn't work. M can't fix a gene -- it can only affect how much melanin a working gey gene makes.  So what are the genetic combinations that give various eye colors using M ? To simplify things, we'll ignore bey2 and just concentrate on green, blue, and hazel.    The blue-eyed parent can only give bm to his children and the hazel-eyed parent can only give GM . So, all of their children will be GbMm or hazel-eyed carriers for green and blue eyes. (See below for a more detailed explanation of where these results came from.)Now we're finally ready to look at some examples of how hazel eyes might be inherited. First, the easiest, a blue-eyed parent with bbmm and a hazel-eyed parent with GGMM .  Let's look at a more interesting example. A blue-eyed parent, bbMM , and a green-eyed parent, GGmm .  This time, the blue-eyed parent can only give bM . The hazel-eyed parent can only give Gm . The end result is all GbMm or hazel eyes! A blue and a green-eyed parent will have all hazel-eyed kids.  This is one of the reasons I like the modifier gene explanation so much. It can help explain how green and blue-eyed parents might have hazel-eyed kids.  Finally, let's tackle a tough one. The faint of heart can skip down to the added links at this point if they want...  Imagine two hazel-eyed parents GbMm . What would their kids look like? For this, we need to bring out the old Punnett square.  The way a Punnett square works is you make a table. You put all the possible gene combinations for the egg on top, and all the gene combinations for sperm on the side. ( Click here for a more detailed explanation of Punnett squares.) For our example, you'd get something like this:    The next step is to match up squares. This will figure out all possible combinations and how likely they'll be.    From this the results are that there is a 4 in 16 chance for blue eyes, a 3 in 16 chance for green and a 9 in 16 chance for hazel. Even though this looks awful, it might be possible to figure things out if this were all that was involved.  Now imagine adding the brown gene to the mix. And another modifier that decreases melanin from bey2 instead of increasing melanin from gey . And now sprinkle in different modifier genes that increase or decrease melanin made by different amounts. And modifier genes that affect the modifier genes. And...  And in reality, eye color may be a result of all of these ideas -- hazel eye color genes, modifier genes, and different versions of bey2 and gey ! As you can see, it all gets complicated pretty quickly. We should be thankful that green, blue, and brown are as simple as they are.

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you don’t have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the baby’s eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. It’s highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and father’s genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Baby’s Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the baby’s eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parents’ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So we’d suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown. Also, make sure to check out our Freshlook Contact Lenses , which are the most popular, and most widely recommended colored contact lens available.
