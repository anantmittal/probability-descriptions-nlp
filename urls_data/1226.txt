         Multiple birth   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

However, it still goes without saying the chances of having them are certainly very slim.  There is no one, consistent statistic quoted when it comes to the odds of having identical triplets.  But the generally agreed upon figures are in the vicinity of between one in 60 thousand to one in 200 million. So it is clear that there is no consensus on the likelihood and even the experts cannot agree. This may be because there is thought to be a natural attrition to the numbers of identical triplets who continue to develop towards birth.  Alternately the true figures just cannot be accounted for.  But what exactly are the odds of having identical triplets?  Non identical triplets occur around once in every 4000 naturally conceived pregnancies. Just for some added confusion, the chances of having identical triplets are about one in every six (overall) triplet pregnancies.  How are identical triplets formed?  The majority of triplets are what is known as trizygotic. This is because they are formed when three separate, individual eggs are fertilised by three separate sperm. These babies share the same characteristics as any other siblings with the same biological parents. They can be the same or opposite genders.  Triplets can also occur when two of the babies are identical and have formed from monozygotic (identical) twins – see below.  This means the other, third baby is a singleton, formed from a completely separate egg and sperm.  Two of the babies will be identical but the third will be their own, unique little individual.  But are all three identical triplets exactly the same?  When one single egg is fertilised by one single sperm and this fertilised zygote quickly and evenly divides into three separate zygotes, identical triplets are formed. Another possibility is that the fertilised egg splits into two and then one of these eggs divides again.  These are what are known formally as monozygotic triplets. This splitting occurs shortly after fertilisation and before a woman even suspects she is pregnant. There is nothing she or her partner can do to influence the likelihood of this occurring. It is pure biological luck.  Even taking fertility hormones such as Clomid will not influence the likelihood of conceiving with identical triplets. Although artificial hormones do increase the number of eggs matured to ovulation each month, Clomid does not cause splitting of the fertilised egg after fertilisation.  Although it is extremely unlikely, it is still possible for identical triplets to occur after single embryo transfer which occurs during fertility assistance.  This did happen to one woman in 2008 (the first recorded event) who was undertaking fertility treatment.   One single embryo split after being returned to her uterus and then divided three times, resulting in three identical boys.  When identical triplets are formed this means that all three share the same identical DNA , gender, characteristics and features.  Some researchers believe that a certain percentage of monozygotic triplets actually start as identical quadruplets but one of the embryos does not continue to grow to maturity or becomes reabsorbed. (See Vanishing Twin Syndrome ).  How would I know if I’m having identical triplets?  You won’t in the early stages of your pregnancy. But you could suspect you are having a multiple pregnancy because of your exaggerated pregnancy symptoms. Extreme nausea, having an obvious pregnancy belly much earlier than expected or being unable to hold even the smallest volume of wee in your bladder may all raise your suspicions.  Triplet pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound and this can be done in the first trimester of pregnancy, based on pregnancy symptoms. It may not be clear in the very early stages of pregnancy if the triplets are identical or not. If they share a placenta, this is a strong and definitive sign that they are identical. However, it can be very difficult to determine via ultrasound the exact placental structure. Separate placentas can also fuse making them appear to be one.  When a triplet pregnancy is confirmed, it is standard obstetric practice for a woman to require more frequent ante natal checks, ultrasounds, pathology work and general health checks. Bed rest may be ordered if there is a threat of miscarriage or premature labour. If a mother is pregnant with triplets and she does not have enough “in home” support, she may need to be hospitalized as an enforced form of bed rest.  Some women who are pregnant with multiple babies need to spend many months in hospital, especially if they are threatening to miscarry and their pregnancy is at risk.  How can you tell identical triplets apart?  Well this can be tricky. Even parents of identical triplets say they can get confused about which baby is which.  This is why many have developed little tricks to help tell their babies apart and not get them confused with each other.  One of the more popular strategies is to paint one little fingernail of each baby with a different colour nail polish. Different coloured clothing on each e.g. white/lemon/pale green; white/pink/blue are also good prompts to differentiate three tiny identical babies.  Some parents retain their triplets hospital arm bands long after they could be removed and only take them off when they become too tight on their babies growing arms.  Each baby is likely to display their own unique and special characteristics from the newborn stage. Parents are often keen to appreciate the individual differences between their three babies and see them as separate rather than “the triplets”. With time and maturity, triplets, just like singletons exert their own, unique personalities.  What are the risks to a mother in carrying identical triplets?  Overall, the metabolic stress to her body of carrying triplets is considerable and as the pregnancy advances, the stress and risks increase.  There is an increased risk of every pregnancy complication including:   Hypertension and Preeclampsia.  Placenta Praevia.  Premature Labour and delivery.  Ante Partum Haemorrhage.  Post Partum Haemorrhage.  Gestational Diabetes.  Caesarian section delivery is most likely. Because of this there are the associated risks of any abdominal surgery including bleeding, infection, delayed healing and pain.   Average Pregnancy Weight Gain with Triplets    First Trimester  Second Trimester  Third Trimester  Average Total Weight Gain    1.8-2.3 kilos  13+ kilos  5-6.9 kilos  20+ kilos    NB Any rapid gain or loss of weight is concerning, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy. Monitoring weight is just one way of assessing maternal/foetal well being and should not be considered in isolation of other observations.  What are the risks to the identical triplets?   Higher incidence of congenital abnormalities.  Prematurity – statistically, the majority of triplets are born before 34 weeks of gestation.  Low birth weight – the average birth weight for an individual triplet is around 1.8 kilos.  Breathing and circulation difficulties due to underdeveloped lungs and immature respiratory function.  Higher risk of infection.  Transfusion Syndrome between the triplets.  Cerebral Palsy.  Global delays including social/Emotional, Communication, Fine Motor and Cognition and Gross Motor.

Although rare, it is entirely possible for women to conceive naturally with three babies.  However, fertility assistance is the strongest influential factor when it comes to having triplets. The current estimate is that around 80-90 sets of HOM babies are born in Australia each year. So if you’re pregnant with triplets, be reassured that you are not alone.  Triplets can be either monozygotic – meaning they are formed after one fertilised egg has split into three identical embryos, or they are dizygotic – meaning they are formed from separate eggs.    Polyzygotic  Triplets can also occur when there is a set of identical (or monozygotic) twins conceived + another egg is released which is then fertilised by another sperm. One very cute term which is used to describe the most common form of spontaneously conceived triplets – identical twins + a fraternal sibling is “A pair and a spare”. This means that the identical twins are always the same gender and exactly the same DNA but the “spare” could potentially be of the opposite sex and share no more characteristics than any other sibling.  Why do so many older women seem to have multiples?  One explanation for why multiples are more common in older women is because as the eggs get older, their quality diminishes and the chances of them splitting increases.  Ovarian production also tends to peak as women age; there is generally a spike in fertility before women enter their peri-menopausal years.  Perhaps this is nature’s way of maximising the chances of a woman having another baby or two before she becomes infertile.  There are also theories about how the brain influences hormone levels and that hormonal imbalance in some women becomes more common.  This then affects ovarian stimulation and how many eggs are supported to maturation each month.  Ways to conceive with triplets   Be an older woman. Women who are aged 30 years plus have a greater chance of conceiving with multiples than younger women do.  Eat a diet which is high in milk, yams and dairy foods.  Be of African descent.  Consider having fertility assistance. Around 85% of triplets are conceived through fertility assistance.  Women who have previously had fertility assistance have a higher than average chance of conceiving naturally with triplets with their consecutive pregnancies.  Have older children; conceiving with multiples is more common in women who have had babies previously.  Come from a family where there is a history of multiple births. Or better still, have your own personal history of having had multiples previously.  Be very, very lucky!   What are my chances of having triplets?  Currently in Australia, the odds of naturally conceiving with triplets are around 1 in every 9000 births. Via fertility assistance, the likelihood increases to around 1 in every 40.  By far the most likely way to conceive with triplets is to have fertility assistance and/or take medication which increases ovulation.  If you come from a family where hyper ovulation occurs, e.g. when the ovaries release more than one egg each month, then you are more likely to conceive with multiples, including triplets.  There is nothing which you can consciously do to increase your chances. Other than having lots of sex when you are most fertile.  Overall, this will increase your chances of conceiving with even one baby.  There does not seem to be any scientific evidence to support the theory that having identical multiples is influenced by heredity.  It seems that the splitting of a fertilised egg happens at random. But hyper ovulation is certainly influenced by genetics, so women who come from families where non-identical multiples are common do have more chances of having their own multiple births.  Will my triplets be born early?  By far the majority of triplets are born premature. This means that they do not reach full term and come before the normal gestational period for human babies which is 38-42 weeks. There are many reasons for this but generally it is because of a lack of room to grow any further in the mother’s uterus.  Most triplets are born between 32-34 weeks of gestation and caesarian section delivery is common.  Smaller hospitals tend to refer mothers who are pregnant with triplets to larger, metropolitan or tertiary maternity hospitals. This is because of the availability of specialist staff and resources for both obstetric and premature baby care.  Common parent reactions when triplets are confirmed  Shock, denial, terror and anxiety are the most common responses.  Most parents find out they are expecting triplets when an ultrasound is done and three tiny embryos are seen on the screen. Multiples may be suspected beforehand due to exaggerated pregnancy symptoms, the use of fertility drugs or assistance, or alternately, a family history of multiple births.  But suspecting triplets may perhaps be in your future and having this confirmed are very different realities.  Many couples emerge from the ultrasound office feeling numb and in shock. They know what they’ve been told and even what they’ve seen, but the reality of this can be too much to take in. There is no one right way to feel when being told that you’re having triplets.  Disbelief, coupled with denial that there must be some sort of mistake also helps to insulate parents from the reality. At least until there has been some time to let the magnitude of this news filter into their consciousness.  It is also common for couples to respond very differently to each other; one may be utterly delighted from the start and the other partner almost horrified.  It can pay to just aim for a quiet few days to let the news settle into your brain and for rational thought to replace surging emotions. Don’t worry about the embryos “knowing” you’re less than delighted. This is impossible and their brains too immature to be capable of interpreting their parent’s reactions.  Be prepared for some interesting responses from your family and friends and even total strangers when you tell them you’re expecting triplets.  Their responses are often so much more about how they would react given the same situation, rather than their feelings about your reality. Just be prepared to smile and try to ignore any negative comments.  Support from close family and friends, as well as multiple birth agencies will help you to process any nagging doubts and/or anxieties you’re bound to have.  Complications of having triplets   Greater risk and range of pregnancy complications generally.  Premature delivery.  Delayed foetal growth otherwise known as IUGR – Intra Uterine Growth Restriction, or SGA – Small for Gestational Age.  Maternal Pre Eclampsia.  Gestational Diabetes.  Anaemia.  Placenta Praevia.  Increased risks to the babies include a higher likelihood of cerebral palsy, prematurity complications including breathing and feeding difficulties and issues with maintaining normal temperature and blood sugar levels.   Logistics of having triplets – what to consider  It goes without saying that as well as the emotional processes involved in having triplets, there are a lot of financial and practical factors to consider as well.   The size of your house, where the babies will sleep and how you’ll fit three bassinettes/cots in.  Your car – fitting three car seats into a standard family vehicle may be a challenge.  A pram or buggy to fit three babies, as well as a toddler and older children if you have them.  Three lots of everything including clothing, bed linen, nappies, changing areas and feeding requirements. Many mothers of triplets do breastfeed or express breast milk for their triplets, at least in the early months. A breast pump will make this job so much easier. Do some research early on in your pregnancy and decide how you want to feed your baby and what will work for you.  Avoid thinking you need to buy everything new. Borrow, lend, rent or buy second hand. You’ll be amazed by the offers you’ll get of clothing, nursery furniture and general baby goods. Don’t be too proud; you will need to get used to accepting all reasonable offers of support and this includes gear which will make life so much easier (and cheaper)  for you and your family.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

You’re likely to hear all of these comments and more when you are pregnant with triplets. Mothers of multiples say these little conversations help though, to build some emotional immunity to the public’s responses.  But this doesn’t make it less wearing of course. One good tip is to use these remarks to build some skills for the inevitable reactions you’ll get when you are caring for three small babies.  Putting a positive slant on the fact that you are pregnant with triplets may be a challenge but it is your reality and you will find it easier if you view your pregnancy in an optimistic way. You are in a very small minority group of mothers who generally find the advantages and benefits of having triplets only increase.  What are fraternal triplets?  Trizygotic or fraternal triplets are formed when three separate eggs are fertilised by three separate sperm.  The babies can be the same or opposite genders. This means that it’s possible to have anyone of the following combinations of babies – three girls/three boys or, one girl and two boys or two girls and one boy.  In terms of similarity, fraternal triplets are no more alike than siblings who have the same biological parents. The only real likenesses they may have are some resemblances of their features and a shared birth date.  This issue of family similarity has fascinated researchers for a very long time. This is why twins and triplets are so commonly used for studies into the subject of nature versus nurture.  Specifically, which is the more powerful determinate when it comes to how children evolve into adults.  How common are fraternal triplets?  Fraternal triplets are more common than identical or monozygotic triplets. Around 80% or more of triplets are the fraternal variety.  This is largely because most of the factors which influence other multiple births (such as twins), which still play a part in conceiving non identical triplets.   There is less likelihood of monozygotic or identical triplets occurring, as these are dependent on the splitting of one embryo into three exact zygotes.  And this understandably is a very rare biological event.  Do fraternal triplets share a placenta?  Fraternal triplets do not share an amniotic sac or placenta. They are three entirely separate and unique little pregnancies.  Because of this, they will be enclosed in their own sacs and have their own umbilical cords and placentas. However, as the pregnancy advances, it is possible for the three placentas to fuse together and appear as if it is one enormous placenta. If it is not clear if your multiples are identical or fraternal, it is common obstetric practice for the placenta to be sent to the laboratory for analysis.  How similar are they?  Fraternal triplets can look just like any other siblings.  If a boy/girl combination is born then understandably, they will   be less alike than three babies of the same gender. But appearances only account for some of the similarities fraternal triplets may have.  It can be relatively easy to differentiate each individual baby’s personality and temperament from the start. One baby may be more active in the uterus and when born, just makes their presence more obvious in their own unique way.  Parents of fraternal triplets say that it is important to try and see each baby as their own unique little person, rather than one of a cluster of three.  Referring to them as “the triplets” instead of by name should be avoided where possible. Calling them by their individual names will help you and your partner build individual, unique relationships with each of them.  In the early days of pregnancy especially, this can be very challenging, but with scans and your growing tummy, you will find ways to differentiate each of your three little babies.  The fact that they are fraternal and started out from conception as three completely separate zygotes may help you to view them from the start as siblings who just happen to be sharing your uterus at the same time!  But the fact that your fraternal triplets have experienced the same intra uterine conditions cannot be overlooked. Your diet, environment, ante natal healthcare and activity will all influence how your babies grow and develop, both in utero and throughout their lives. The concept of Epigenetics is fascinating and looks at how factors such as ante natal nutrition, diet and stress can all influence the genes which are passed through generations of the same family.  How to increase the chances of having fraternal triplets   Have fertility assistance. The more eggs which are supported to maturity and released through ovulation each month, the greater the chances of conception. Bear in mind though that legislation is in place governing the number of embryos which can be transplanted back into a woman’s uterus.  Pick your own parents carefully – taller women are more likely to have multiples.  Women who have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ) have a greater likelihood of multiple births.  Have a history of undergoing fertility assistance in the past.  Each a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and/or sweet potatoes.  Be within an older age group. Women who are aged over 30 years have a higher than average chance of having multiples.  Be of African/American descent.  Having a multiple pregnancy previously increases the chances.  Come from a family where multiple births are more common.  Have lots of sex when you are most fertile.   Average pregnancy weight gain with triplets    First Trimester  Second Trimester  Third Trimester  Average Total Weight Gain    1.8-2.3 kilos  13+ kilos  5-6.9 kilos  20+ kilos    NB Any rapid gain or loss of weight is concerning, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy.  Monitoring weight is just one way of assessing maternal/foetal well being and should not be considered in isolation of other observations.  What’s worth remembering  Being told you are expecting triplets can be very confronting and sometimes a period of professional emotional support can be very helpful. Some pregnant women and their partners need ante natal counseling from a healthcare professional.   If you are genuinely concerned about how you are going to cope, then ask for help from family and friends. Be specific about what you need them to do and build networks of practical support. Being organized is the first step towards making this an enjoyable time in your life rather than barely tolerating it.  Many expectant parents worry about how they could possibly love three babies who are all born at the same time. Imagining that you are capable of building a deep emotional connection with more than one baby can seem overwhelming, until they are actually born. When you see your babies and they are individuals, rather than images on a screen or fighting for space in your uterus, then all will be clear. Give yourself time and practice to get to know your babies. Nature has designed our babies to help us fall in love with them. Be confident, stay calm and believe in your own abilities.  Good, regular ante natal care is vital. If you are pregnant with fraternal twins you will be in what is considered a “high-risk” pregnancy. Monitoring, checking and ultrasounds will become a regular part of your life for the next seven-eight months at least. Make a point of getting to know your healthcare provider and building a trusting relationship with them. It is important that you feel comfortable enough to ask any question which crosses your mind, so you can clear your thoughts for the next inevitable query.  Don’t forget that in order for your body to grow and support three little babies at the one time, you will need to care well for their mother. Eating well, resting when you can, gentle exercise and having healthy emotional relationships will all play a crucial role in supporting your own good health.

However, it still goes without saying the chances of having them are certainly very slim.  There is no one, consistent statistic quoted when it comes to the odds of having identical triplets.  But the generally agreed upon figures are in the vicinity of between one in 60 thousand to one in 200 million. So it is clear that there is no consensus on the likelihood and even the experts cannot agree. This may be because there is thought to be a natural attrition to the numbers of identical triplets who continue to develop towards birth.  Alternately the true figures just cannot be accounted for.  But what exactly are the odds of having identical triplets?  Non identical triplets occur around once in every 4000 naturally conceived pregnancies. Just for some added confusion, the chances of having identical triplets are about one in every six (overall) triplet pregnancies.  How are identical triplets formed?  The majority of triplets are what is known as trizygotic. This is because they are formed when three separate, individual eggs are fertilised by three separate sperm. These babies share the same characteristics as any other siblings with the same biological parents. They can be the same or opposite genders.  Triplets can also occur when two of the babies are identical and have formed from monozygotic (identical) twins – see below.  This means the other, third baby is a singleton, formed from a completely separate egg and sperm.  Two of the babies will be identical but the third will be their own, unique little individual.  But are all three identical triplets exactly the same?  When one single egg is fertilised by one single sperm and this fertilised zygote quickly and evenly divides into three separate zygotes, identical triplets are formed. Another possibility is that the fertilised egg splits into two and then one of these eggs divides again.  These are what are known formally as monozygotic triplets. This splitting occurs shortly after fertilisation and before a woman even suspects she is pregnant. There is nothing she or her partner can do to influence the likelihood of this occurring. It is pure biological luck.  Even taking fertility hormones such as Clomid will not influence the likelihood of conceiving with identical triplets. Although artificial hormones do increase the number of eggs matured to ovulation each month, Clomid does not cause splitting of the fertilised egg after fertilisation.  Although it is extremely unlikely, it is still possible for identical triplets to occur after single embryo transfer which occurs during fertility assistance.  This did happen to one woman in 2008 (the first recorded event) who was undertaking fertility treatment.   One single embryo split after being returned to her uterus and then divided three times, resulting in three identical boys.  When identical triplets are formed this means that all three share the same identical DNA , gender, characteristics and features.  Some researchers believe that a certain percentage of monozygotic triplets actually start as identical quadruplets but one of the embryos does not continue to grow to maturity or becomes reabsorbed. (See Vanishing Twin Syndrome ).  How would I know if I’m having identical triplets?  You won’t in the early stages of your pregnancy. But you could suspect you are having a multiple pregnancy because of your exaggerated pregnancy symptoms. Extreme nausea, having an obvious pregnancy belly much earlier than expected or being unable to hold even the smallest volume of wee in your bladder may all raise your suspicions.  Triplet pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound and this can be done in the first trimester of pregnancy, based on pregnancy symptoms. It may not be clear in the very early stages of pregnancy if the triplets are identical or not. If they share a placenta, this is a strong and definitive sign that they are identical. However, it can be very difficult to determine via ultrasound the exact placental structure. Separate placentas can also fuse making them appear to be one.  When a triplet pregnancy is confirmed, it is standard obstetric practice for a woman to require more frequent ante natal checks, ultrasounds, pathology work and general health checks. Bed rest may be ordered if there is a threat of miscarriage or premature labour. If a mother is pregnant with triplets and she does not have enough “in home” support, she may need to be hospitalized as an enforced form of bed rest.  Some women who are pregnant with multiple babies need to spend many months in hospital, especially if they are threatening to miscarry and their pregnancy is at risk.  How can you tell identical triplets apart?  Well this can be tricky. Even parents of identical triplets say they can get confused about which baby is which.  This is why many have developed little tricks to help tell their babies apart and not get them confused with each other.  One of the more popular strategies is to paint one little fingernail of each baby with a different colour nail polish. Different coloured clothing on each e.g. white/lemon/pale green; white/pink/blue are also good prompts to differentiate three tiny identical babies.  Some parents retain their triplets hospital arm bands long after they could be removed and only take them off when they become too tight on their babies growing arms.  Each baby is likely to display their own unique and special characteristics from the newborn stage. Parents are often keen to appreciate the individual differences between their three babies and see them as separate rather than “the triplets”. With time and maturity, triplets, just like singletons exert their own, unique personalities.  What are the risks to a mother in carrying identical triplets?  Overall, the metabolic stress to her body of carrying triplets is considerable and as the pregnancy advances, the stress and risks increase.  There is an increased risk of every pregnancy complication including:   Hypertension and Preeclampsia.  Placenta Praevia.  Premature Labour and delivery.  Ante Partum Haemorrhage.  Post Partum Haemorrhage.  Gestational Diabetes.  Caesarian section delivery is most likely. Because of this there are the associated risks of any abdominal surgery including bleeding, infection, delayed healing and pain.   Average Pregnancy Weight Gain with Triplets    First Trimester  Second Trimester  Third Trimester  Average Total Weight Gain    1.8-2.3 kilos  13+ kilos  5-6.9 kilos  20+ kilos    NB Any rapid gain or loss of weight is concerning, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy. Monitoring weight is just one way of assessing maternal/foetal well being and should not be considered in isolation of other observations.  What are the risks to the identical triplets?   Higher incidence of congenital abnormalities.  Prematurity – statistically, the majority of triplets are born before 34 weeks of gestation.  Low birth weight – the average birth weight for an individual triplet is around 1.8 kilos.  Breathing and circulation difficulties due to underdeveloped lungs and immature respiratory function.  Higher risk of infection.  Transfusion Syndrome between the triplets.  Cerebral Palsy.  Global delays including social/Emotional, Communication, Fine Motor and Cognition and Gross Motor.

Multiple birth   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Multiples in pregnancy Twins triplets quads identical and fraternal            Home : Ovulation Planner : Duedate : Baby Names : Week by Week : Site Map :             Types of Multiples in pregnancy   A pregnancy of two or more fetuses is called a multiple pregnancy. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

The reason we don’t have more identical triplets running around is very simple—and it probably goes against what you’ve heard about twins (or triplets, for that matter). There are two types of multiples: monozygotic (identical) or dizygotic (fraternal). Dizygotic multiples occur when more than one fertilized egg becomes an embryo. Monozygotic multiples occur when the egg divides after fertilization, meaning that the multiples share the same DNA. Scientists don’t really understand why the fertilized eggs—called zygotes at this point—decide to split, but it doesn’t happen as often as two separate sperm fertilizing two separate eggs. For identical triplets to happen, that zygote needs to split two times, which is even more rare. (And yes, fertility treatments like in-vitro fertilization [IVF] have boosted the twin and triplet rate in countries like the US, but these are because multiple fertilized eggs are being implanted in the mother’s uterus; they’re fraternal. Moms over 30 are also more likely to ovulate more than one egg, so more US mothers delaying parenthood is another reason for more twins and triplets. Again, though, fraternal.) But we all know plenty of identical twins, right? So why aren’t there more identical triplets? Rachel Feltman at the Washington Post explains , and busts a myth about multiples you might have repeated yourself: Contrary to popular belief, identical twins don’t actually run in families. Fraternal twins might, if the women in a particular family share some genetic trait that makes them more likely to release two eggs during an ovulation cycle instead of one. But for now, there’s no evidence of a genetic predisposition for zygote splitting. Advertisement So there you go. Just because you’re a mom who is a twin, or has twins in your family, it doesn’t mean that you’re more likely to have identical twins. It just means you might have inherited a tendency to ovulate two or more eggs at once (which doesn’t even guarantee twins, actually). Because if identical twins were genetically determined, identical twins would be more likely to have identical twins, and there would be many more identical twins (and therefore the chance of many more identical triplets) on the planet. Instead, it’s totally and consistently random—about three births per 1000 worldwide are identical twins. And that’s why these identical triplets are one-in-a-million. (Actually, a study says it’s closer to 20 or 30 in a million . But still!) Now look at these cute monozygotic multiples.

Identical Triplets, Conceived without Fertility Drugs, are 'One in a Million'     By Gillian Mohney  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Gillian   Dec. 5, 2013   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play Randy Pench, The Sacramento Bee/AP Photo WATCH Rare Identical Triplets Conceived in California  0 Shares               Email      A Sacramento couple hit the genetic lottery when they welcomed identical triplets, conceived without fertility drugs, last month. Doctors say the odds of naturally conceiving identical triplets, where a single fertilized egg is divided into three separate embryos, may be as high as "one in a million"  Newborn Triplets Challenge Guinness Weight Record  The parents of the triplets told reporters they were happy about their three bundles of joy. "It's everything at once. I think you can get lost just staring in their faces," said the triplets' mother, Hannah Hepner. "But it's overwhelming to think about everything to come." The newborn babies each weighed in between three and four pounds at birth. Dr. William Gilbert, the director of Women's Services for Sutter Health in Sacramento, Calif., treated the Hepner family and said there was not a definite rate for the number of identical triplets born every year. "It's hard to calculate a conservative estimate," Gilbert told ABCNews.com about the rate of naturally conceived identical triplets. "One in 70,000 that would be on the low end, the high end is one in a million." While the Hepner babies were born healthy, carrying identical multiple fetuses during pregnancy can mean extra complications, said Gilbert. Unlike fraternal twins, identical twins often share the placenta and are at the risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The condition, where blood from one fetus transfers to another, can affect the growth of the triplets during the pregnancy. "The blood vessels that come from the umbilical cord can mean too much blood flow to one fetus and not enough to another," said Gilbert. "I worry more about the identical twins more than fraternal twins." Gilbert said one complication for the Hepner family was that Hanna Hepner suffered from preeclampsia prior to giving birth. The condition is characterized by a sudden rise in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. Gilbert explained preeclampsia is caused by the placenta. With triplets, there were three times the amount of placenta that could potentially cause complications. "Mom starts getting high blood pressure and it gets so high she could have a stroke," said Gilbert of preeclampsia. "It's a delicate balancing act, keeping the babies inside as long as it's safe for them." Gilbert said most triplets are delivered at 32 weeks into the pregnancy and the Hepner babies were delivered healthy at 33 weeks.

Like twins, triplets and other higher-order multiples can be categorized by their zygosity . While many people are familiar with the terms "identical" and "fraternal" in describing multiples, and use these terms to define whether twins or triplets look similar, what they are really referring to is how the multiples form. Most triplets are trizygotic, meaning that each individual forms from a separate zygote, or egg/sperm combination.         They are commonly described as "fraternal" multiples and share the same genetic similarities as any siblings. However, it is not uncommon for triplets to be dizygotic , which occurs when two eggs are fertilized by sperm, and one of the fertilized eggs splits into two. Essentially, two of the triplets are monozygotic (identical) twins, sharing the same general DNA characteristics, while the third multiple was produced by a different egg/sperm combination and has a unique genetic makeup from the other two triplets. Monozygotic Triplets It is rare for triplets to be completely monozygotic, meaning that all three children formed from a single egg that split three ways or splits into two and then one of the two splits again, ultimately resulting in three embryos with the same general DNA characteristics. Monozygotic triplets are always of the same gender, either all boys or all girls. Some monozygotic triplets are actually quadruplets where one embryo has vanished or been reabsorbed.   A monozygotic triplet pregnancy carries the risks of a monozygotic pregnancy with a shared placenta, plus the additional risks of a triplet pregnancy. A pregnancy of this type is more likely to encounter problems such as pre-eclampsia , preterm labor , and even transfusion syndrome.​ Because of the rarity, identical triplets often make headlines, for example when a monozygotic triplet pregnancy resulted after a single embryo was implanted in an in-vitro procedure.         Allison Penn gave birth to Logan, Eli, and Collin in March 2008. Her doctors identified the situation as the only known case of a single embryo transfer resulting in triplets. What are the Odds? Research varies on the instances of monozygotic triplets.  A 2012 case report of a healthy set of three identical triplet boys conceived spontaneously lists the incidence at 1 in 100,000 live births, with most of the reported cases conceived through assisted reproductive techniques. That paper noted that only seven other cases were known that were spontaneously conceived. A 2015 paper notes the rate of incidence of identical triplets is 100 times more frequent with assisted reproductive techniques than spontaneous conception but is still extremely rare. Meanwhile, estimates seen in popular media range from between 1 in 60,000 and 1 in 200 million. This may be due to some numbers reflecting the rate of conceptions/pregnancies rather than with live triplet births. Sources: Gandham S, Ogueh O.

Couple's naturally conceived triplets defy astonishing odds of 200 MILLION-TO-ONE after being born identical  To learn you are expecting triplets is a shock for any mother-to-be But Jane Wrigley was told that her three daughters would be identical Naturally conceived identical triplets like Erica, Claudia and Ava are very rare By Lucy Laing and Stephen Adams for The Mail on Sunday   Published: 17:01 EDT, 2 September 2017 |  Updated: 17:01 EDT, 2 September 2017              e-mail          557  shares     223  View comments     To learn you are expecting triplets is a shock for any mother-to-be. But for Jane Wrigley there was an especially astonishing twist – as she was told that her three daughters would be identical. Naturally conceived identical triplets such as Erica, Claudia and Ava are phenomenally rare, with the chances of having them as high as one in 200 million. Doctors said her embryo split just after conception, as happens with identical twins. But then the remarkable happened – and one of the resultant embryos split again. In contrast, non-identical twins and triplets are caused by multiple sperm fertilising multiple eggs.          Three of a kind: Naturally conceived identical triplets such as Erica, Claudia and Ava Wrigley (pictured with their mother, Jane), born at Leighton Hospital in Crewe, are phenomenally rare Jane and her husband Oscar, a 54-year-old airline pilot, found out they were expecting triplets at her scan. And the fact they all shared a placenta told medics that the three were identical. She said: 'We went for a scan. Oscar saw the three heartbeats first, and then I did. It was such a shock.'

Share this article  Share     Jane, 41, said the prospect was 'daunting' – especially as her other daughter, Matilda, was only a toddler herself. She said: 'The scan meant that I was going to be a mother to four children under the age of 18 months. But we were excited to meet our new arrivals.'          Rare: Doctors said Jane's embryo split just after conception, as happens with identical twins. But then the remarkable happened – and one of the resultant embryos split again to lead to this happy family of five (with husband Oscar Wrigley, left, and Jane, right) At 29 weeks into her pregnancy, Jane suffered complications, but with the help of medics at Leighton Hospital in Crewe, the triplets were born three weeks later, in January last year, by caesarean. Nine weeks early, Ava weighed 3lb 2oz, Erica weighed 3lb 5oz and Claudia just 2lb 8oz. They were kept in hospital for two months, but are now thriving. Jane said: 'It was amazing to see them all born safely. When I held them for the first time, it was a wonderful feeling. It was such a relief that they had all arrived healthy.' At first it was difficult to distinguish between them, she admitted. 'So that's when we decided to paint their toenails. It was the only way we could be absolutely sure who was who.'

March 23, 2011 12:16 PM   Subscribe  What are the odds, really, of having identical triplets?   Okay, I'm not really asking for the odds, but I do want to be able to dispute a statistic that is often quoted  in  the media and by other people.  It is often said that the odds of having identical triplets are 1:200 million. Which to me sounds ridiculous, but I'm not sure if my reasoning is sound.  We have identical triplets, born in December of 2007. I know of several other sets, also born in 2007. At least 3 (one set in 4/2007, one in 8/2007, and another set in 12/2007.) These are only ones I've met online. I'm assuming there are more out there.   According to the CDC , there were 4,317,119 births in 2007. (I don't know if they count a multiples birth as one, or if it's one per kid, but I don't think that really matters for the purposes of this question.) Four of those, at least, were ID triplets. That's more like 1:1,000,000, and those are only the sets I know. So it's likely to be even less than that. Right?  I'm just annoyed by reading that 1:200 million  statistic, and would like to be able to refute it intelligently.  (I'm just posting information from 2007 since that's what I have, but I assume the birth rates are the same every year.)  As you can tell from a previous question , I don't really understand probability and statistics all that well. So use layman's terms, if you don't mind.  posted by pyjammy to Science & Nature (24 answers total) 2 users marked this as a favorite           you need to find out, from the CDC or whomever tracks those birth statistics, how many of those births were triplets.  Then, you need to look at data over a span of several decades, not just one year.  Then, you can calculate the correct odds.  What you're suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 10 times, and did not get 5 heads and 5 tails, therefore the 50/50 odds of coinflips is wrong." posted by k5.user at 12:24 PM on March 23, 2011  Here's two data points:   The National Center for Health Statistics says there were 294 sets of triplets born in the United States in 1944 out of a total of 2,794,800 births.  There is no record of how many of the 294 were identical triples. But Dr. Louis G. Keith of the Northwestern University Medical School, who has written extensively on this subject, believes most of those 294 were probably identical.  With fertility treatments affecting birth rates now, in 2002 there were 6,898 sets of triplets out of 4,021,726 births in the U.S. and again, there is no record of how many of these were identical. Fertility treatments do not cause identical triplets to be born as they utilize individual eggs for their zygotes. Identical triplets are mono-zygotic (a single zygote which splits into three). So with more triplets being born and the rate of identical triplets staying the same, identical triplets are more rare now than they were back in 1944.  The odds of conceiving "spontaneous" triplets is about 1 in 8,100. In the early '80s, triplets occurred 1 in every 6,400. Today, odds are that 1 in every 1,300 are triplets. Over the last decade, increases in the number of triplet births averaged 11 percent a year.  The 1 in 200 million quote seems completely fabricated, if "most" triplets born pre-fertility-drugs were identical. However, keep in mind triplets born in 2007 are still fairly young; they might not look as identical as they get older. We'll need DNA tests to be sure. posted by gerryblog at 12:28 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 3 favorites ]  Are they genetically identical or just looks REALLY REALLY similar? Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, for example, are not genetically identical (I read somewhere in the last 2 decades.) posted by k8t at 12:29 PM on March 23, 2011  According to this page identical triplets occur in 1 in 62500 pregnancies.  It looks truthy and facty to me, though who knows. posted by PercussivePaul at 12:35 PM on March 23, 2011  Based on UK statistics (2009, Office of National Statistics, General Registry Office Scotland and GRO Northern Ireland), the rate of any twin is 16 in 1000 births, and the rate of identical twins is 1/3 that, or figure 5 in 1000 births.  I think the formation of an identical triplet would require first the formation of an identical twin, and then one of those twins to form another identical twin. So my estimate would be 5 in one million. posted by babbageboole at 12:37 PM on March 23, 2011  And, of course, I can't multiply. I meant 25 in one million, or 1 in 40,000. That seems a bit high, though. posted by babbageboole at 12:38 PM on March 23, 2011  gerryblog - that's a great article!  k8 - send me your address and I'll send you one.  PercussivePaul, I've always liked that statistic. It seems more realistic to me. That's the one I generally tell people when they ask how rare it is. I think I must have gotten it from that same page.  Babbageboole, I like the way you came up with that. That makes sense to me. posted by pyjammy at 12:47 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 2 favorites ]  If the odds of having identical triplets were one in 200 million, there would be about thirty-five sets of them in the world -- seven billion divided by 200 million. This seems unreasonably low.  babbageboole: there's something called "Hellin's Law" which is a rule of thumb for the incidence of all multiple births, not just identical ones; it states that the frequency of twins is one in 89, of triplets is one in 89 2 , and so on. This agrees with your intuition but I don't know enough about the mechanism to say whether it would apply specifically to identical multiple births. posted by madcaptenor at 12:49 PM on March 23, 2011  Statistics are either true or false. Just because something "makes sense" or "seems more realistic" doesn't mean that it's any more likely to be true. posted by 23skidoo at 12:51 PM on March 23, 2011  23skidoo - really? What about incorrect statistics, like the one my question is about? posted by pyjammy at 12:54 PM on March 23, 2011  It's incorrect if someone shows it to be incorrect. It's not incorrect just because it seems wrong. posted by 23skidoo at 1:06 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 4 favorites ]  I'm seeing statistic similar to babbage's: worldwide, the rate for monozygotic twins is 4 in 1000, which (in theory) calculates out to 16:1000000 for triplets, or 1:62500.  As PercussivePaul points out, this is a number that a lot of places cite. posted by specialagentwebb at 1:17 PM on March 23, 2011  Ah well, I did say I'm not great at understanding statistics. posted by pyjammy at 1:24 PM on March 23, 2011  Then, you need to look at data over a span of several decades, not just one year.  Then, you can calculate the correct odds.  Not when the alleged probability is that far off from the observed figure.  If the alleged probability were, say, 1 in 2 million, while the observed rate in 2007 was about 1 in 1 million, you're right that you'd need to collect more data.  However, if the actual probability of a birth being identical triplets is 1 in 200,000,000, then the probability of 4 or more births out of 4317119 being identical triplets is on the order of 10 -8 .  (Calculated as 1 minus the probability of having 0-3 identical triplets out of those 4317119, which in turn is sum{i=0 to 3} p i (1-p) N-1 C[N,i], where p=1/200000000, N=4317119, and C[x,y] is the binomial coefficent.)  You might object that that would be the probability in a randomly chosen year, and there may be some selection bias—no one questions the lack of identical triplets in years when that never happens.  Which would be a valid objection.  So the probability of 4 identical triplets being born in the same year any time in US history would be less than 2x10 -6 (probably much less, given that most of those years would have had far fewer than 4317119 births), if the cited probability were correct.  We can quite confidently reject the hypothesis that the probability of identical triplets is 1 in 200 million per birth in the United States without the need to collect any further data.   What you're suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 10 times, and did not get 5 heads and 5 tails, therefore the 50/50 odds of coinflips is wrong."  No, what pyjammy is suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 32 times and it came up heads 31 times and tails once, therefore this coin does not have a 0.5 probability of coming up heads on a single flip." posted by DevilsAdvocate at 1:34 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 3 favorites ]  Well, just remember that there are lies, damn lies, and statistics. Also, 23skidoo... statistics isn't about truth, it's about estimation. If you want to estimate something random, you have to measure it, and then assume a particular random process, and even then statistics will tell you how likely it is that your estimate matches your assumption.  "Makes sense" and "seems realistic" are just intuitive methods of determining the likelihood of your estimate matching an underlying process, just as statistical hypothesis testing is a mathematical method. posted by babbageboole at 1:36 PM on March 23, 2011  Does this count? I don't think so.  I know one set of triplets: the two girls are identical and there's also a boy (not identical). Is it worth mentioning they were born on February 29?  Other than the leap year business, is this more common? posted by crankyrogalsky at 2:03 PM on March 23, 2011  Even if I concede that statistics is about estimation, that's still not a reason to promote "making sense" and "seeming realistic" as good things to do when evaluating statistics, because people suck at estimating. posted by 23skidoo at 2:07 PM on March 23, 2011  that's still not a reason to promote "making sense" and "seeming realistic" as good things to do when evaluating statistics, because people suck at estimating  What? Really? If we do a calculation and come up with a figure that the average person owns 63 cars, we shouldn't ask ourselves if that makes sense as a means to evaluate whether or not the calculation was done correctly? How do you propose we detect when statistical things were figured incorrectly? The statistic of 1 in 200 million births being triplets defies expectation because (it seems) most people know a set of triplets, but we know most people don't know 200 million people. It absolutely warrants further investigation on that basis. posted by 0xFCAF at 2:20 PM on March 23, 2011  Are they genetically identical or just looks REALLY REALLY similar? Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, for example, are not genetically identical (I read somewhere in the last 2 decades.)  The New York Times mentioned it in their story about the Olsen twins in this article . Their younger sister also looks very similar to them . posted by anniecat at 2:49 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 1 favorite ]  crankyrogalsky - that is not all that uncommon, actually. "Pair and a spare" is sometimes what it's called. The birthday, however, is certainly unusual! I mean, not statistically , because I'm only guessing. posted by pyjammy at 3:18 PM on March 23, 2011  I would guess that most "identical" twins and triplets are not genetically identical. Twins run in my family quite a bit and I don't think any of them are genetic twins (based on them saying/knowing definitively they're not) although most of them do look very alike. My mom and her twin sister look identical to non family but they're not. posted by fshgrl at 3:38 PM on March 23, 2011  FWIW, unless any of your acquaintances live in Portland, I know of YET ANOTHER set of identical triplets born in 2007. posted by KathrynT at 10:10 PM on March 23, 2011  fshgrl - only fraternal twins "run" in families, identical twins/triplets are flukes. I am only counting people who knew for sure that their triplets are identical. I had mine DNA tested, but when you have 20 ultrasounds in your pregnancy, it's easy to know that they are indeed monochorionic (i.e., identical.)  kathryn - interesting! I don't think I know that set. (The ones I know all have blogs or are online in some way. If they do, you can message me.) posted by pyjammy at 4:16 AM on March 24, 2011  If we do a calculation and come up with a figure that the average person owns 63 cars, we shouldn't ask ourselves if that makes sense as a means to evaluate whether or not the calculation was done correctly?  I didn't say you shouldn't question statistics that sound way off. I said that when you hear a statistic that sounds way off, and one that you think "sounds right", you shouldn't go "Oh, the second one SEEMS right, it's probably correct". Seems right based on what? It's easy to think about whether or not you know anyone with 63 cars to give you a sense about whether that statistic is wrong. But like, what're the odds (without looking it up or doing the math) of getting a straight flush in poker? I imagine what most people think is the right answer would be really far away from the right answer. posted by 23skidoo at 8:05 AM on March 25, 2011   « Older Pirozhki Dough recipe?   |   Looking for realtime vocal feature tracking...

Multiple birth   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

However, it still goes without saying the chances of having them are certainly very slim.  There is no one, consistent statistic quoted when it comes to the odds of having identical triplets.  But the generally agreed upon figures are in the vicinity of between one in 60 thousand to one in 200 million. So it is clear that there is no consensus on the likelihood and even the experts cannot agree. This may be because there is thought to be a natural attrition to the numbers of identical triplets who continue to develop towards birth.  Alternately the true figures just cannot be accounted for.  But what exactly are the odds of having identical triplets?  Non identical triplets occur around once in every 4000 naturally conceived pregnancies. Just for some added confusion, the chances of having identical triplets are about one in every six (overall) triplet pregnancies.  How are identical triplets formed?  The majority of triplets are what is known as trizygotic. This is because they are formed when three separate, individual eggs are fertilised by three separate sperm. These babies share the same characteristics as any other siblings with the same biological parents. They can be the same or opposite genders.  Triplets can also occur when two of the babies are identical and have formed from monozygotic (identical) twins – see below.  This means the other, third baby is a singleton, formed from a completely separate egg and sperm.  Two of the babies will be identical but the third will be their own, unique little individual.  But are all three identical triplets exactly the same?  When one single egg is fertilised by one single sperm and this fertilised zygote quickly and evenly divides into three separate zygotes, identical triplets are formed. Another possibility is that the fertilised egg splits into two and then one of these eggs divides again.  These are what are known formally as monozygotic triplets. This splitting occurs shortly after fertilisation and before a woman even suspects she is pregnant. There is nothing she or her partner can do to influence the likelihood of this occurring. It is pure biological luck.  Even taking fertility hormones such as Clomid will not influence the likelihood of conceiving with identical triplets. Although artificial hormones do increase the number of eggs matured to ovulation each month, Clomid does not cause splitting of the fertilised egg after fertilisation.  Although it is extremely unlikely, it is still possible for identical triplets to occur after single embryo transfer which occurs during fertility assistance.  This did happen to one woman in 2008 (the first recorded event) who was undertaking fertility treatment.   One single embryo split after being returned to her uterus and then divided three times, resulting in three identical boys.  When identical triplets are formed this means that all three share the same identical DNA , gender, characteristics and features.  Some researchers believe that a certain percentage of monozygotic triplets actually start as identical quadruplets but one of the embryos does not continue to grow to maturity or becomes reabsorbed. (See Vanishing Twin Syndrome ).  How would I know if I’m having identical triplets?  You won’t in the early stages of your pregnancy. But you could suspect you are having a multiple pregnancy because of your exaggerated pregnancy symptoms. Extreme nausea, having an obvious pregnancy belly much earlier than expected or being unable to hold even the smallest volume of wee in your bladder may all raise your suspicions.  Triplet pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound and this can be done in the first trimester of pregnancy, based on pregnancy symptoms. It may not be clear in the very early stages of pregnancy if the triplets are identical or not. If they share a placenta, this is a strong and definitive sign that they are identical. However, it can be very difficult to determine via ultrasound the exact placental structure. Separate placentas can also fuse making them appear to be one.  When a triplet pregnancy is confirmed, it is standard obstetric practice for a woman to require more frequent ante natal checks, ultrasounds, pathology work and general health checks. Bed rest may be ordered if there is a threat of miscarriage or premature labour. If a mother is pregnant with triplets and she does not have enough “in home” support, she may need to be hospitalized as an enforced form of bed rest.  Some women who are pregnant with multiple babies need to spend many months in hospital, especially if they are threatening to miscarry and their pregnancy is at risk.  How can you tell identical triplets apart?  Well this can be tricky. Even parents of identical triplets say they can get confused about which baby is which.  This is why many have developed little tricks to help tell their babies apart and not get them confused with each other.  One of the more popular strategies is to paint one little fingernail of each baby with a different colour nail polish. Different coloured clothing on each e.g. white/lemon/pale green; white/pink/blue are also good prompts to differentiate three tiny identical babies.  Some parents retain their triplets hospital arm bands long after they could be removed and only take them off when they become too tight on their babies growing arms.  Each baby is likely to display their own unique and special characteristics from the newborn stage. Parents are often keen to appreciate the individual differences between their three babies and see them as separate rather than “the triplets”. With time and maturity, triplets, just like singletons exert their own, unique personalities.  What are the risks to a mother in carrying identical triplets?  Overall, the metabolic stress to her body of carrying triplets is considerable and as the pregnancy advances, the stress and risks increase.  There is an increased risk of every pregnancy complication including:   Hypertension and Preeclampsia.  Placenta Praevia.  Premature Labour and delivery.  Ante Partum Haemorrhage.  Post Partum Haemorrhage.  Gestational Diabetes.  Caesarian section delivery is most likely. Because of this there are the associated risks of any abdominal surgery including bleeding, infection, delayed healing and pain.   Average Pregnancy Weight Gain with Triplets    First Trimester  Second Trimester  Third Trimester  Average Total Weight Gain    1.8-2.3 kilos  13+ kilos  5-6.9 kilos  20+ kilos    NB Any rapid gain or loss of weight is concerning, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy. Monitoring weight is just one way of assessing maternal/foetal well being and should not be considered in isolation of other observations.  What are the risks to the identical triplets?   Higher incidence of congenital abnormalities.  Prematurity – statistically, the majority of triplets are born before 34 weeks of gestation.  Low birth weight – the average birth weight for an individual triplet is around 1.8 kilos.  Breathing and circulation difficulties due to underdeveloped lungs and immature respiratory function.  Higher risk of infection.  Transfusion Syndrome between the triplets.  Cerebral Palsy.  Global delays including social/Emotional, Communication, Fine Motor and Cognition and Gross Motor.

Although rare, it is entirely possible for women to conceive naturally with three babies.  However, fertility assistance is the strongest influential factor when it comes to having triplets. The current estimate is that around 80-90 sets of HOM babies are born in Australia each year. So if you’re pregnant with triplets, be reassured that you are not alone.  Triplets can be either monozygotic – meaning they are formed after one fertilised egg has split into three identical embryos, or they are dizygotic – meaning they are formed from separate eggs.    Polyzygotic  Triplets can also occur when there is a set of identical (or monozygotic) twins conceived + another egg is released which is then fertilised by another sperm. One very cute term which is used to describe the most common form of spontaneously conceived triplets – identical twins + a fraternal sibling is “A pair and a spare”. This means that the identical twins are always the same gender and exactly the same DNA but the “spare” could potentially be of the opposite sex and share no more characteristics than any other sibling.  Why do so many older women seem to have multiples?  One explanation for why multiples are more common in older women is because as the eggs get older, their quality diminishes and the chances of them splitting increases.  Ovarian production also tends to peak as women age; there is generally a spike in fertility before women enter their peri-menopausal years.  Perhaps this is nature’s way of maximising the chances of a woman having another baby or two before she becomes infertile.  There are also theories about how the brain influences hormone levels and that hormonal imbalance in some women becomes more common.  This then affects ovarian stimulation and how many eggs are supported to maturation each month.  Ways to conceive with triplets   Be an older woman. Women who are aged 30 years plus have a greater chance of conceiving with multiples than younger women do.  Eat a diet which is high in milk, yams and dairy foods.  Be of African descent.  Consider having fertility assistance. Around 85% of triplets are conceived through fertility assistance.  Women who have previously had fertility assistance have a higher than average chance of conceiving naturally with triplets with their consecutive pregnancies.  Have older children; conceiving with multiples is more common in women who have had babies previously.  Come from a family where there is a history of multiple births. Or better still, have your own personal history of having had multiples previously.  Be very, very lucky!   What are my chances of having triplets?  Currently in Australia, the odds of naturally conceiving with triplets are around 1 in every 9000 births. Via fertility assistance, the likelihood increases to around 1 in every 40.  By far the most likely way to conceive with triplets is to have fertility assistance and/or take medication which increases ovulation.  If you come from a family where hyper ovulation occurs, e.g. when the ovaries release more than one egg each month, then you are more likely to conceive with multiples, including triplets.  There is nothing which you can consciously do to increase your chances. Other than having lots of sex when you are most fertile.  Overall, this will increase your chances of conceiving with even one baby.  There does not seem to be any scientific evidence to support the theory that having identical multiples is influenced by heredity.  It seems that the splitting of a fertilised egg happens at random. But hyper ovulation is certainly influenced by genetics, so women who come from families where non-identical multiples are common do have more chances of having their own multiple births.  Will my triplets be born early?  By far the majority of triplets are born premature. This means that they do not reach full term and come before the normal gestational period for human babies which is 38-42 weeks. There are many reasons for this but generally it is because of a lack of room to grow any further in the mother’s uterus.  Most triplets are born between 32-34 weeks of gestation and caesarian section delivery is common.  Smaller hospitals tend to refer mothers who are pregnant with triplets to larger, metropolitan or tertiary maternity hospitals. This is because of the availability of specialist staff and resources for both obstetric and premature baby care.  Common parent reactions when triplets are confirmed  Shock, denial, terror and anxiety are the most common responses.  Most parents find out they are expecting triplets when an ultrasound is done and three tiny embryos are seen on the screen. Multiples may be suspected beforehand due to exaggerated pregnancy symptoms, the use of fertility drugs or assistance, or alternately, a family history of multiple births.  But suspecting triplets may perhaps be in your future and having this confirmed are very different realities.  Many couples emerge from the ultrasound office feeling numb and in shock. They know what they’ve been told and even what they’ve seen, but the reality of this can be too much to take in. There is no one right way to feel when being told that you’re having triplets.  Disbelief, coupled with denial that there must be some sort of mistake also helps to insulate parents from the reality. At least until there has been some time to let the magnitude of this news filter into their consciousness.  It is also common for couples to respond very differently to each other; one may be utterly delighted from the start and the other partner almost horrified.  It can pay to just aim for a quiet few days to let the news settle into your brain and for rational thought to replace surging emotions. Don’t worry about the embryos “knowing” you’re less than delighted. This is impossible and their brains too immature to be capable of interpreting their parent’s reactions.  Be prepared for some interesting responses from your family and friends and even total strangers when you tell them you’re expecting triplets.  Their responses are often so much more about how they would react given the same situation, rather than their feelings about your reality. Just be prepared to smile and try to ignore any negative comments.  Support from close family and friends, as well as multiple birth agencies will help you to process any nagging doubts and/or anxieties you’re bound to have.  Complications of having triplets   Greater risk and range of pregnancy complications generally.  Premature delivery.  Delayed foetal growth otherwise known as IUGR – Intra Uterine Growth Restriction, or SGA – Small for Gestational Age.  Maternal Pre Eclampsia.  Gestational Diabetes.  Anaemia.  Placenta Praevia.  Increased risks to the babies include a higher likelihood of cerebral palsy, prematurity complications including breathing and feeding difficulties and issues with maintaining normal temperature and blood sugar levels.   Logistics of having triplets – what to consider  It goes without saying that as well as the emotional processes involved in having triplets, there are a lot of financial and practical factors to consider as well.   The size of your house, where the babies will sleep and how you’ll fit three bassinettes/cots in.  Your car – fitting three car seats into a standard family vehicle may be a challenge.  A pram or buggy to fit three babies, as well as a toddler and older children if you have them.  Three lots of everything including clothing, bed linen, nappies, changing areas and feeding requirements. Many mothers of triplets do breastfeed or express breast milk for their triplets, at least in the early months. A breast pump will make this job so much easier. Do some research early on in your pregnancy and decide how you want to feed your baby and what will work for you.  Avoid thinking you need to buy everything new. Borrow, lend, rent or buy second hand. You’ll be amazed by the offers you’ll get of clothing, nursery furniture and general baby goods. Don’t be too proud; you will need to get used to accepting all reasonable offers of support and this includes gear which will make life so much easier (and cheaper)  for you and your family.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

You’re likely to hear all of these comments and more when you are pregnant with triplets. Mothers of multiples say these little conversations help though, to build some emotional immunity to the public’s responses.  But this doesn’t make it less wearing of course. One good tip is to use these remarks to build some skills for the inevitable reactions you’ll get when you are caring for three small babies.  Putting a positive slant on the fact that you are pregnant with triplets may be a challenge but it is your reality and you will find it easier if you view your pregnancy in an optimistic way. You are in a very small minority group of mothers who generally find the advantages and benefits of having triplets only increase.  What are fraternal triplets?  Trizygotic or fraternal triplets are formed when three separate eggs are fertilised by three separate sperm.  The babies can be the same or opposite genders. This means that it’s possible to have anyone of the following combinations of babies – three girls/three boys or, one girl and two boys or two girls and one boy.  In terms of similarity, fraternal triplets are no more alike than siblings who have the same biological parents. The only real likenesses they may have are some resemblances of their features and a shared birth date.  This issue of family similarity has fascinated researchers for a very long time. This is why twins and triplets are so commonly used for studies into the subject of nature versus nurture.  Specifically, which is the more powerful determinate when it comes to how children evolve into adults.  How common are fraternal triplets?  Fraternal triplets are more common than identical or monozygotic triplets. Around 80% or more of triplets are the fraternal variety.  This is largely because most of the factors which influence other multiple births (such as twins), which still play a part in conceiving non identical triplets.   There is less likelihood of monozygotic or identical triplets occurring, as these are dependent on the splitting of one embryo into three exact zygotes.  And this understandably is a very rare biological event.  Do fraternal triplets share a placenta?  Fraternal triplets do not share an amniotic sac or placenta. They are three entirely separate and unique little pregnancies.  Because of this, they will be enclosed in their own sacs and have their own umbilical cords and placentas. However, as the pregnancy advances, it is possible for the three placentas to fuse together and appear as if it is one enormous placenta. If it is not clear if your multiples are identical or fraternal, it is common obstetric practice for the placenta to be sent to the laboratory for analysis.  How similar are they?  Fraternal triplets can look just like any other siblings.  If a boy/girl combination is born then understandably, they will   be less alike than three babies of the same gender. But appearances only account for some of the similarities fraternal triplets may have.  It can be relatively easy to differentiate each individual baby’s personality and temperament from the start. One baby may be more active in the uterus and when born, just makes their presence more obvious in their own unique way.  Parents of fraternal triplets say that it is important to try and see each baby as their own unique little person, rather than one of a cluster of three.  Referring to them as “the triplets” instead of by name should be avoided where possible. Calling them by their individual names will help you and your partner build individual, unique relationships with each of them.  In the early days of pregnancy especially, this can be very challenging, but with scans and your growing tummy, you will find ways to differentiate each of your three little babies.  The fact that they are fraternal and started out from conception as three completely separate zygotes may help you to view them from the start as siblings who just happen to be sharing your uterus at the same time!  But the fact that your fraternal triplets have experienced the same intra uterine conditions cannot be overlooked. Your diet, environment, ante natal healthcare and activity will all influence how your babies grow and develop, both in utero and throughout their lives. The concept of Epigenetics is fascinating and looks at how factors such as ante natal nutrition, diet and stress can all influence the genes which are passed through generations of the same family.  How to increase the chances of having fraternal triplets   Have fertility assistance. The more eggs which are supported to maturity and released through ovulation each month, the greater the chances of conception. Bear in mind though that legislation is in place governing the number of embryos which can be transplanted back into a woman’s uterus.  Pick your own parents carefully – taller women are more likely to have multiples.  Women who have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ) have a greater likelihood of multiple births.  Have a history of undergoing fertility assistance in the past.  Each a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and/or sweet potatoes.  Be within an older age group. Women who are aged over 30 years have a higher than average chance of having multiples.  Be of African/American descent.  Having a multiple pregnancy previously increases the chances.  Come from a family where multiple births are more common.  Have lots of sex when you are most fertile.   Average pregnancy weight gain with triplets    First Trimester  Second Trimester  Third Trimester  Average Total Weight Gain    1.8-2.3 kilos  13+ kilos  5-6.9 kilos  20+ kilos    NB Any rapid gain or loss of weight is concerning, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy.  Monitoring weight is just one way of assessing maternal/foetal well being and should not be considered in isolation of other observations.  What’s worth remembering  Being told you are expecting triplets can be very confronting and sometimes a period of professional emotional support can be very helpful. Some pregnant women and their partners need ante natal counseling from a healthcare professional.   If you are genuinely concerned about how you are going to cope, then ask for help from family and friends. Be specific about what you need them to do and build networks of practical support. Being organized is the first step towards making this an enjoyable time in your life rather than barely tolerating it.  Many expectant parents worry about how they could possibly love three babies who are all born at the same time. Imagining that you are capable of building a deep emotional connection with more than one baby can seem overwhelming, until they are actually born. When you see your babies and they are individuals, rather than images on a screen or fighting for space in your uterus, then all will be clear. Give yourself time and practice to get to know your babies. Nature has designed our babies to help us fall in love with them. Be confident, stay calm and believe in your own abilities.  Good, regular ante natal care is vital. If you are pregnant with fraternal twins you will be in what is considered a “high-risk” pregnancy. Monitoring, checking and ultrasounds will become a regular part of your life for the next seven-eight months at least. Make a point of getting to know your healthcare provider and building a trusting relationship with them. It is important that you feel comfortable enough to ask any question which crosses your mind, so you can clear your thoughts for the next inevitable query.  Don’t forget that in order for your body to grow and support three little babies at the one time, you will need to care well for their mother. Eating well, resting when you can, gentle exercise and having healthy emotional relationships will all play a crucial role in supporting your own good health.

However, it still goes without saying the chances of having them are certainly very slim.  There is no one, consistent statistic quoted when it comes to the odds of having identical triplets.  But the generally agreed upon figures are in the vicinity of between one in 60 thousand to one in 200 million. So it is clear that there is no consensus on the likelihood and even the experts cannot agree. This may be because there is thought to be a natural attrition to the numbers of identical triplets who continue to develop towards birth.  Alternately the true figures just cannot be accounted for.  But what exactly are the odds of having identical triplets?  Non identical triplets occur around once in every 4000 naturally conceived pregnancies. Just for some added confusion, the chances of having identical triplets are about one in every six (overall) triplet pregnancies.  How are identical triplets formed?  The majority of triplets are what is known as trizygotic. This is because they are formed when three separate, individual eggs are fertilised by three separate sperm. These babies share the same characteristics as any other siblings with the same biological parents. They can be the same or opposite genders.  Triplets can also occur when two of the babies are identical and have formed from monozygotic (identical) twins – see below.  This means the other, third baby is a singleton, formed from a completely separate egg and sperm.  Two of the babies will be identical but the third will be their own, unique little individual.  But are all three identical triplets exactly the same?  When one single egg is fertilised by one single sperm and this fertilised zygote quickly and evenly divides into three separate zygotes, identical triplets are formed. Another possibility is that the fertilised egg splits into two and then one of these eggs divides again.  These are what are known formally as monozygotic triplets. This splitting occurs shortly after fertilisation and before a woman even suspects she is pregnant. There is nothing she or her partner can do to influence the likelihood of this occurring. It is pure biological luck.  Even taking fertility hormones such as Clomid will not influence the likelihood of conceiving with identical triplets. Although artificial hormones do increase the number of eggs matured to ovulation each month, Clomid does not cause splitting of the fertilised egg after fertilisation.  Although it is extremely unlikely, it is still possible for identical triplets to occur after single embryo transfer which occurs during fertility assistance.  This did happen to one woman in 2008 (the first recorded event) who was undertaking fertility treatment.   One single embryo split after being returned to her uterus and then divided three times, resulting in three identical boys.  When identical triplets are formed this means that all three share the same identical DNA , gender, characteristics and features.  Some researchers believe that a certain percentage of monozygotic triplets actually start as identical quadruplets but one of the embryos does not continue to grow to maturity or becomes reabsorbed. (See Vanishing Twin Syndrome ).  How would I know if I’m having identical triplets?  You won’t in the early stages of your pregnancy. But you could suspect you are having a multiple pregnancy because of your exaggerated pregnancy symptoms. Extreme nausea, having an obvious pregnancy belly much earlier than expected or being unable to hold even the smallest volume of wee in your bladder may all raise your suspicions.  Triplet pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound and this can be done in the first trimester of pregnancy, based on pregnancy symptoms. It may not be clear in the very early stages of pregnancy if the triplets are identical or not. If they share a placenta, this is a strong and definitive sign that they are identical. However, it can be very difficult to determine via ultrasound the exact placental structure. Separate placentas can also fuse making them appear to be one.  When a triplet pregnancy is confirmed, it is standard obstetric practice for a woman to require more frequent ante natal checks, ultrasounds, pathology work and general health checks. Bed rest may be ordered if there is a threat of miscarriage or premature labour. If a mother is pregnant with triplets and she does not have enough “in home” support, she may need to be hospitalized as an enforced form of bed rest.  Some women who are pregnant with multiple babies need to spend many months in hospital, especially if they are threatening to miscarry and their pregnancy is at risk.  How can you tell identical triplets apart?  Well this can be tricky. Even parents of identical triplets say they can get confused about which baby is which.  This is why many have developed little tricks to help tell their babies apart and not get them confused with each other.  One of the more popular strategies is to paint one little fingernail of each baby with a different colour nail polish. Different coloured clothing on each e.g. white/lemon/pale green; white/pink/blue are also good prompts to differentiate three tiny identical babies.  Some parents retain their triplets hospital arm bands long after they could be removed and only take them off when they become too tight on their babies growing arms.  Each baby is likely to display their own unique and special characteristics from the newborn stage. Parents are often keen to appreciate the individual differences between their three babies and see them as separate rather than “the triplets”. With time and maturity, triplets, just like singletons exert their own, unique personalities.  What are the risks to a mother in carrying identical triplets?  Overall, the metabolic stress to her body of carrying triplets is considerable and as the pregnancy advances, the stress and risks increase.  There is an increased risk of every pregnancy complication including:   Hypertension and Preeclampsia.  Placenta Praevia.  Premature Labour and delivery.  Ante Partum Haemorrhage.  Post Partum Haemorrhage.  Gestational Diabetes.  Caesarian section delivery is most likely. Because of this there are the associated risks of any abdominal surgery including bleeding, infection, delayed healing and pain.   Average Pregnancy Weight Gain with Triplets    First Trimester  Second Trimester  Third Trimester  Average Total Weight Gain    1.8-2.3 kilos  13+ kilos  5-6.9 kilos  20+ kilos    NB Any rapid gain or loss of weight is concerning, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy. Monitoring weight is just one way of assessing maternal/foetal well being and should not be considered in isolation of other observations.  What are the risks to the identical triplets?   Higher incidence of congenital abnormalities.  Prematurity – statistically, the majority of triplets are born before 34 weeks of gestation.  Low birth weight – the average birth weight for an individual triplet is around 1.8 kilos.  Breathing and circulation difficulties due to underdeveloped lungs and immature respiratory function.  Higher risk of infection.  Transfusion Syndrome between the triplets.  Cerebral Palsy.  Global delays including social/Emotional, Communication, Fine Motor and Cognition and Gross Motor.

Multiple birth   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Multiples in pregnancy Twins triplets quads identical and fraternal            Home : Ovulation Planner : Duedate : Baby Names : Week by Week : Site Map :             Types of Multiples in pregnancy   A pregnancy of two or more fetuses is called a multiple pregnancy. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

The reason we don’t have more identical triplets running around is very simple—and it probably goes against what you’ve heard about twins (or triplets, for that matter). There are two types of multiples: monozygotic (identical) or dizygotic (fraternal). Dizygotic multiples occur when more than one fertilized egg becomes an embryo. Monozygotic multiples occur when the egg divides after fertilization, meaning that the multiples share the same DNA. Scientists don’t really understand why the fertilized eggs—called zygotes at this point—decide to split, but it doesn’t happen as often as two separate sperm fertilizing two separate eggs. For identical triplets to happen, that zygote needs to split two times, which is even more rare. (And yes, fertility treatments like in-vitro fertilization [IVF] have boosted the twin and triplet rate in countries like the US, but these are because multiple fertilized eggs are being implanted in the mother’s uterus; they’re fraternal. Moms over 30 are also more likely to ovulate more than one egg, so more US mothers delaying parenthood is another reason for more twins and triplets. Again, though, fraternal.) But we all know plenty of identical twins, right? So why aren’t there more identical triplets? Rachel Feltman at the Washington Post explains , and busts a myth about multiples you might have repeated yourself: Contrary to popular belief, identical twins don’t actually run in families. Fraternal twins might, if the women in a particular family share some genetic trait that makes them more likely to release two eggs during an ovulation cycle instead of one. But for now, there’s no evidence of a genetic predisposition for zygote splitting. Advertisement So there you go. Just because you’re a mom who is a twin, or has twins in your family, it doesn’t mean that you’re more likely to have identical twins. It just means you might have inherited a tendency to ovulate two or more eggs at once (which doesn’t even guarantee twins, actually). Because if identical twins were genetically determined, identical twins would be more likely to have identical twins, and there would be many more identical twins (and therefore the chance of many more identical triplets) on the planet. Instead, it’s totally and consistently random—about three births per 1000 worldwide are identical twins. And that’s why these identical triplets are one-in-a-million. (Actually, a study says it’s closer to 20 or 30 in a million . But still!) Now look at these cute monozygotic multiples.

Identical Triplets, Conceived without Fertility Drugs, are 'One in a Million'     By Gillian Mohney  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Gillian   Dec. 5, 2013   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play Randy Pench, The Sacramento Bee/AP Photo WATCH Rare Identical Triplets Conceived in California  0 Shares               Email      A Sacramento couple hit the genetic lottery when they welcomed identical triplets, conceived without fertility drugs, last month. Doctors say the odds of naturally conceiving identical triplets, where a single fertilized egg is divided into three separate embryos, may be as high as "one in a million"  Newborn Triplets Challenge Guinness Weight Record  The parents of the triplets told reporters they were happy about their three bundles of joy. "It's everything at once. I think you can get lost just staring in their faces," said the triplets' mother, Hannah Hepner. "But it's overwhelming to think about everything to come." The newborn babies each weighed in between three and four pounds at birth. Dr. William Gilbert, the director of Women's Services for Sutter Health in Sacramento, Calif., treated the Hepner family and said there was not a definite rate for the number of identical triplets born every year. "It's hard to calculate a conservative estimate," Gilbert told ABCNews.com about the rate of naturally conceived identical triplets. "One in 70,000 that would be on the low end, the high end is one in a million." While the Hepner babies were born healthy, carrying identical multiple fetuses during pregnancy can mean extra complications, said Gilbert. Unlike fraternal twins, identical twins often share the placenta and are at the risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The condition, where blood from one fetus transfers to another, can affect the growth of the triplets during the pregnancy. "The blood vessels that come from the umbilical cord can mean too much blood flow to one fetus and not enough to another," said Gilbert. "I worry more about the identical twins more than fraternal twins." Gilbert said one complication for the Hepner family was that Hanna Hepner suffered from preeclampsia prior to giving birth. The condition is characterized by a sudden rise in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. Gilbert explained preeclampsia is caused by the placenta. With triplets, there were three times the amount of placenta that could potentially cause complications. "Mom starts getting high blood pressure and it gets so high she could have a stroke," said Gilbert of preeclampsia. "It's a delicate balancing act, keeping the babies inside as long as it's safe for them." Gilbert said most triplets are delivered at 32 weeks into the pregnancy and the Hepner babies were delivered healthy at 33 weeks.

Like twins, triplets and other higher-order multiples can be categorized by their zygosity . While many people are familiar with the terms "identical" and "fraternal" in describing multiples, and use these terms to define whether twins or triplets look similar, what they are really referring to is how the multiples form. Most triplets are trizygotic, meaning that each individual forms from a separate zygote, or egg/sperm combination.         They are commonly described as "fraternal" multiples and share the same genetic similarities as any siblings. However, it is not uncommon for triplets to be dizygotic , which occurs when two eggs are fertilized by sperm, and one of the fertilized eggs splits into two. Essentially, two of the triplets are monozygotic (identical) twins, sharing the same general DNA characteristics, while the third multiple was produced by a different egg/sperm combination and has a unique genetic makeup from the other two triplets. Monozygotic Triplets It is rare for triplets to be completely monozygotic, meaning that all three children formed from a single egg that split three ways or splits into two and then one of the two splits again, ultimately resulting in three embryos with the same general DNA characteristics. Monozygotic triplets are always of the same gender, either all boys or all girls. Some monozygotic triplets are actually quadruplets where one embryo has vanished or been reabsorbed.   A monozygotic triplet pregnancy carries the risks of a monozygotic pregnancy with a shared placenta, plus the additional risks of a triplet pregnancy. A pregnancy of this type is more likely to encounter problems such as pre-eclampsia , preterm labor , and even transfusion syndrome.​ Because of the rarity, identical triplets often make headlines, for example when a monozygotic triplet pregnancy resulted after a single embryo was implanted in an in-vitro procedure.         Allison Penn gave birth to Logan, Eli, and Collin in March 2008. Her doctors identified the situation as the only known case of a single embryo transfer resulting in triplets. What are the Odds? Research varies on the instances of monozygotic triplets.  A 2012 case report of a healthy set of three identical triplet boys conceived spontaneously lists the incidence at 1 in 100,000 live births, with most of the reported cases conceived through assisted reproductive techniques. That paper noted that only seven other cases were known that were spontaneously conceived. A 2015 paper notes the rate of incidence of identical triplets is 100 times more frequent with assisted reproductive techniques than spontaneous conception but is still extremely rare. Meanwhile, estimates seen in popular media range from between 1 in 60,000 and 1 in 200 million. This may be due to some numbers reflecting the rate of conceptions/pregnancies rather than with live triplet births. Sources: Gandham S, Ogueh O.

Couple's naturally conceived triplets defy astonishing odds of 200 MILLION-TO-ONE after being born identical  To learn you are expecting triplets is a shock for any mother-to-be But Jane Wrigley was told that her three daughters would be identical Naturally conceived identical triplets like Erica, Claudia and Ava are very rare By Lucy Laing and Stephen Adams for The Mail on Sunday   Published: 17:01 EDT, 2 September 2017 |  Updated: 17:01 EDT, 2 September 2017              e-mail          557  shares     223  View comments     To learn you are expecting triplets is a shock for any mother-to-be. But for Jane Wrigley there was an especially astonishing twist – as she was told that her three daughters would be identical. Naturally conceived identical triplets such as Erica, Claudia and Ava are phenomenally rare, with the chances of having them as high as one in 200 million. Doctors said her embryo split just after conception, as happens with identical twins. But then the remarkable happened – and one of the resultant embryos split again. In contrast, non-identical twins and triplets are caused by multiple sperm fertilising multiple eggs.          Three of a kind: Naturally conceived identical triplets such as Erica, Claudia and Ava Wrigley (pictured with their mother, Jane), born at Leighton Hospital in Crewe, are phenomenally rare Jane and her husband Oscar, a 54-year-old airline pilot, found out they were expecting triplets at her scan. And the fact they all shared a placenta told medics that the three were identical. She said: 'We went for a scan. Oscar saw the three heartbeats first, and then I did. It was such a shock.'

Share this article  Share     Jane, 41, said the prospect was 'daunting' – especially as her other daughter, Matilda, was only a toddler herself. She said: 'The scan meant that I was going to be a mother to four children under the age of 18 months. But we were excited to meet our new arrivals.'          Rare: Doctors said Jane's embryo split just after conception, as happens with identical twins. But then the remarkable happened – and one of the resultant embryos split again to lead to this happy family of five (with husband Oscar Wrigley, left, and Jane, right) At 29 weeks into her pregnancy, Jane suffered complications, but with the help of medics at Leighton Hospital in Crewe, the triplets were born three weeks later, in January last year, by caesarean. Nine weeks early, Ava weighed 3lb 2oz, Erica weighed 3lb 5oz and Claudia just 2lb 8oz. They were kept in hospital for two months, but are now thriving. Jane said: 'It was amazing to see them all born safely. When I held them for the first time, it was a wonderful feeling. It was such a relief that they had all arrived healthy.' At first it was difficult to distinguish between them, she admitted. 'So that's when we decided to paint their toenails. It was the only way we could be absolutely sure who was who.' The task is easier now the girls are 16 months old and developing their own personalities. Erica is 'cuddly', Claudia is 'independent' and Ava 'cheeky'.

March 23, 2011 12:16 PM   Subscribe  What are the odds, really, of having identical triplets?   Okay, I'm not really asking for the odds, but I do want to be able to dispute a statistic that is often quoted  in  the media and by other people.  It is often said that the odds of having identical triplets are 1:200 million. Which to me sounds ridiculous, but I'm not sure if my reasoning is sound.  We have identical triplets, born in December of 2007. I know of several other sets, also born in 2007. At least 3 (one set in 4/2007, one in 8/2007, and another set in 12/2007.) These are only ones I've met online. I'm assuming there are more out there.   According to the CDC , there were 4,317,119 births in 2007. (I don't know if they count a multiples birth as one, or if it's one per kid, but I don't think that really matters for the purposes of this question.) Four of those, at least, were ID triplets. That's more like 1:1,000,000, and those are only the sets I know. So it's likely to be even less than that. Right?  I'm just annoyed by reading that 1:200 million  statistic, and would like to be able to refute it intelligently.  (I'm just posting information from 2007 since that's what I have, but I assume the birth rates are the same every year.)  As you can tell from a previous question , I don't really understand probability and statistics all that well. So use layman's terms, if you don't mind.  posted by pyjammy to Science & Nature (24 answers total) 2 users marked this as a favorite           you need to find out, from the CDC or whomever tracks those birth statistics, how many of those births were triplets.  Then, you need to look at data over a span of several decades, not just one year.  Then, you can calculate the correct odds.  What you're suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 10 times, and did not get 5 heads and 5 tails, therefore the 50/50 odds of coinflips is wrong." posted by k5.user at 12:24 PM on March 23, 2011  Here's two data points:   The National Center for Health Statistics says there were 294 sets of triplets born in the United States in 1944 out of a total of 2,794,800 births.  There is no record of how many of the 294 were identical triples. But Dr. Louis G. Keith of the Northwestern University Medical School, who has written extensively on this subject, believes most of those 294 were probably identical.  With fertility treatments affecting birth rates now, in 2002 there were 6,898 sets of triplets out of 4,021,726 births in the U.S. and again, there is no record of how many of these were identical. Fertility treatments do not cause identical triplets to be born as they utilize individual eggs for their zygotes. Identical triplets are mono-zygotic (a single zygote which splits into three). So with more triplets being born and the rate of identical triplets staying the same, identical triplets are more rare now than they were back in 1944.  The odds of conceiving "spontaneous" triplets is about 1 in 8,100. In the early '80s, triplets occurred 1 in every 6,400. Today, odds are that 1 in every 1,300 are triplets. Over the last decade, increases in the number of triplet births averaged 11 percent a year.  The 1 in 200 million quote seems completely fabricated, if "most" triplets born pre-fertility-drugs were identical. However, keep in mind triplets born in 2007 are still fairly young; they might not look as identical as they get older. We'll need DNA tests to be sure. posted by gerryblog at 12:28 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 3 favorites ]  Are they genetically identical or just looks REALLY REALLY similar? Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, for example, are not genetically identical (I read somewhere in the last 2 decades.) posted by k8t at 12:29 PM on March 23, 2011  According to this page identical triplets occur in 1 in 62500 pregnancies.  It looks truthy and facty to me, though who knows. posted by PercussivePaul at 12:35 PM on March 23, 2011  Based on UK statistics (2009, Office of National Statistics, General Registry Office Scotland and GRO Northern Ireland), the rate of any twin is 16 in 1000 births, and the rate of identical twins is 1/3 that, or figure 5 in 1000 births.  I think the formation of an identical triplet would require first the formation of an identical twin, and then one of those twins to form another identical twin. So my estimate would be 5 in one million. posted by babbageboole at 12:37 PM on March 23, 2011  And, of course, I can't multiply. I meant 25 in one million, or 1 in 40,000. That seems a bit high, though. posted by babbageboole at 12:38 PM on March 23, 2011  gerryblog - that's a great article!  k8 - send me your address and I'll send you one.  PercussivePaul, I've always liked that statistic. It seems more realistic to me. That's the one I generally tell people when they ask how rare it is. I think I must have gotten it from that same page.  Babbageboole, I like the way you came up with that. That makes sense to me. posted by pyjammy at 12:47 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 2 favorites ]  If the odds of having identical triplets were one in 200 million, there would be about thirty-five sets of them in the world -- seven billion divided by 200 million. This seems unreasonably low.  babbageboole: there's something called "Hellin's Law" which is a rule of thumb for the incidence of all multiple births, not just identical ones; it states that the frequency of twins is one in 89, of triplets is one in 89 2 , and so on. This agrees with your intuition but I don't know enough about the mechanism to say whether it would apply specifically to identical multiple births. posted by madcaptenor at 12:49 PM on March 23, 2011  Statistics are either true or false. Just because something "makes sense" or "seems more realistic" doesn't mean that it's any more likely to be true. posted by 23skidoo at 12:51 PM on March 23, 2011  23skidoo - really? What about incorrect statistics, like the one my question is about? posted by pyjammy at 12:54 PM on March 23, 2011  It's incorrect if someone shows it to be incorrect. It's not incorrect just because it seems wrong. posted by 23skidoo at 1:06 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 4 favorites ]  I'm seeing statistic similar to babbage's: worldwide, the rate for monozygotic twins is 4 in 1000, which (in theory) calculates out to 16:1000000 for triplets, or 1:62500.  As PercussivePaul points out, this is a number that a lot of places cite. posted by specialagentwebb at 1:17 PM on March 23, 2011  Ah well, I did say I'm not great at understanding statistics. posted by pyjammy at 1:24 PM on March 23, 2011  Then, you need to look at data over a span of several decades, not just one year.  Then, you can calculate the correct odds.  Not when the alleged probability is that far off from the observed figure.  If the alleged probability were, say, 1 in 2 million, while the observed rate in 2007 was about 1 in 1 million, you're right that you'd need to collect more data.  However, if the actual probability of a birth being identical triplets is 1 in 200,000,000, then the probability of 4 or more births out of 4317119 being identical triplets is on the order of 10 -8 .  (Calculated as 1 minus the probability of having 0-3 identical triplets out of those 4317119, which in turn is sum{i=0 to 3} p i (1-p) N-1 C[N,i], where p=1/200000000, N=4317119, and C[x,y] is the binomial coefficent.)  You might object that that would be the probability in a randomly chosen year, and there may be some selection bias—no one questions the lack of identical triplets in years when that never happens.  Which would be a valid objection.  So the probability of 4 identical triplets being born in the same year any time in US history would be less than 2x10 -6 (probably much less, given that most of those years would have had far fewer than 4317119 births), if the cited probability were correct.  We can quite confidently reject the hypothesis that the probability of identical triplets is 1 in 200 million per birth in the United States without the need to collect any further data.   What you're suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 10 times, and did not get 5 heads and 5 tails, therefore the 50/50 odds of coinflips is wrong."  No, what pyjammy is suggesting is like saying "I flipped a coin 32 times and it came up heads 31 times and tails once, therefore this coin does not have a 0.5 probability of coming up heads on a single flip." posted by DevilsAdvocate at 1:34 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 3 favorites ]  Well, just remember that there are lies, damn lies, and statistics. Also, 23skidoo... statistics isn't about truth, it's about estimation. If you want to estimate something random, you have to measure it, and then assume a particular random process, and even then statistics will tell you how likely it is that your estimate matches your assumption.  "Makes sense" and "seems realistic" are just intuitive methods of determining the likelihood of your estimate matching an underlying process, just as statistical hypothesis testing is a mathematical method. posted by babbageboole at 1:36 PM on March 23, 2011  Does this count? I don't think so.  I know one set of triplets: the two girls are identical and there's also a boy (not identical). Is it worth mentioning they were born on February 29?  Other than the leap year business, is this more common? posted by crankyrogalsky at 2:03 PM on March 23, 2011  Even if I concede that statistics is about estimation, that's still not a reason to promote "making sense" and "seeming realistic" as good things to do when evaluating statistics, because people suck at estimating. posted by 23skidoo at 2:07 PM on March 23, 2011  that's still not a reason to promote "making sense" and "seeming realistic" as good things to do when evaluating statistics, because people suck at estimating  What? Really? If we do a calculation and come up with a figure that the average person owns 63 cars, we shouldn't ask ourselves if that makes sense as a means to evaluate whether or not the calculation was done correctly? How do you propose we detect when statistical things were figured incorrectly? The statistic of 1 in 200 million births being triplets defies expectation because (it seems) most people know a set of triplets, but we know most people don't know 200 million people. It absolutely warrants further investigation on that basis. posted by 0xFCAF at 2:20 PM on March 23, 2011  Are they genetically identical or just looks REALLY REALLY similar? Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, for example, are not genetically identical (I read somewhere in the last 2 decades.)  The New York Times mentioned it in their story about the Olsen twins in this article . Their younger sister also looks very similar to them . posted by anniecat at 2:49 PM on March 23, 2011 [ 1 favorite ]  crankyrogalsky - that is not all that uncommon, actually. "Pair and a spare" is sometimes what it's called. The birthday, however, is certainly unusual! I mean, not statistically , because I'm only guessing. posted by pyjammy at 3:18 PM on March 23, 2011  I would guess that most "identical" twins and triplets are not genetically identical. Twins run in my family quite a bit and I don't think any of them are genetic twins (based on them saying/knowing definitively they're not) although most of them do look very alike. My mom and her twin sister look identical to non family but they're not. posted by fshgrl at 3:38 PM on March 23, 2011  FWIW, unless any of your acquaintances live in Portland, I know of YET ANOTHER set of identical triplets born in 2007. posted by KathrynT at 10:10 PM on March 23, 2011  fshgrl - only fraternal twins "run" in families, identical twins/triplets are flukes. I am only counting people who knew for sure that their triplets are identical. I had mine DNA tested, but when you have 20 ultrasounds in your pregnancy, it's easy to know that they are indeed monochorionic (i.e., identical.)  kathryn - interesting! I don't think I know that set. (The ones I know all have blogs or are online in some way. If they do, you can message me.) posted by pyjammy at 4:16 AM on March 24, 2011  If we do a calculation and come up with a figure that the average person owns 63 cars, we shouldn't ask ourselves if that makes sense as a means to evaluate whether or not the calculation was done correctly?  I didn't say you shouldn't question statistics that sound way off. I said that when you hear a statistic that sounds way off, and one that you think "sounds right", you shouldn't go "Oh, the second one SEEMS right, it's probably correct". Seems right based on what? It's easy to think about whether or not you know anyone with 63 cars to give you a sense about whether that statistic is wrong. But like, what're the odds (without looking it up or doing the math) of getting a straight flush in poker? I imagine what most people think is the right answer would be really far away from the right answer. posted by 23skidoo at 8:05 AM on March 25, 2011   « Older Pirozhki Dough recipe?   |   Looking for realtime vocal feature tracking...
