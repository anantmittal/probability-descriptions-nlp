There are 366 days in a leap year, i.e, 1 more than a normal year.  Now, 52 weeks make up 344 days (52 x 7 = 344) That means that we already have 52 sundays for sure.  Then, we are left with 2 days. Now, these days can be any from a pair of- mon-tues,tues-wed,wed-thurs,thurs-fri,fri-sat,sat-sun,sun-mon. Here favourable cases are sat-sun and sun-mon i.e, 2 cases and total number of cases is 7.  So, Probability=number of favourable cases/Total number of cases.  Therefore, Probability= 2/7.         About the author   Yatharth R. is an online   tutor

The Solution goes :  For 53 Sundays, we proceed as: $\frac{366}{7} = 52.28$; So we can be sure that there are 52 Sundays, now the only question is of the 1 Sunday. So $7\cdot 52 = 364$. Therefore the remaining 2 days (366-364) decide the probability of being a Sunday. So we consider pairings of 2 consecutive days -   Sunday-Monday  Monday-Tuesday  Tuesday-Wednesday  Wednesday-Thursday  Thursday-Friday  Friday-Saturday  Saturday-Sunday   So out of the 7 pairs, we have 2 pairs that include a Sunday. Therefore the probability of having 53 Sundays in a Leap Year is $\frac{2}{7}$.  Then I was wondering, what if we ask "Probability that a leap year has 52 Sundays", Considering the above solution for 53 Sundays, the answer to the 52 Sundays problem should be 1. (Since $\frac{366}{7} = 52.28$) So we have complete 52 weeks and hence always 52 Sundays, therefore 1.  I found some online forums, where the answer to $52$ Sundays Problem is not 1. Hence my confusion.

I say this because this year the year starts on a Friday and there are 53 Saturdays, but only 52 Sundays.  Whatever days are the 2 extra are the ones that will occur 53 times.

This can't happen in 2/7 of all leap years, because the distribution of leap years and first-days-of-the year repeats every 400 years. There are 97 leap years in each such period, which is not a multiple of 7.  More precisely, in every 400-year period,   13 leap years start on a Monday  14 leap years start on a Tuesday  14 leap years start on a Wednesday  13 leap years start on a Thursday  15 leap years start on a Friday  13 leap years start on a Saturday  15 leap years start on a Sunday   So the probablility that a leap year chosen uniformly among the leap years in a cycle starts on a Monday or Tuesday (and so contains 53 Tuesdays) is
$$ \frac{13+14}{97} = \frac{27}{97} \qquad (= \tfrac27-\tfrac{5}{679}) $$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 27 '14 at 4:25             answered Jan 27 '14 at 4:02       Henning Makholm   214k 14 276 500                  Yeah, this is the best answer so far. – John  Jan 27 '14 at 4:09        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      The Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years (because there are 97 leap years every 400 years, and $400(365)+97$ is a multiple of $7$), so it suffices to count the number of leap years in the period from $1601$ to $2000$ that contain 53 Tuesdays.  In the first 84 years of each century, there will be 21 leap years (xx04, xx08, ..., xx84). Because these leap years occur at regular intervals, 3 of them will start on each day of the week. So 6 will start on a Monday or a Tuesday each century; this gives $24$ leap years that start on a Monday or a Tuesday in the first $84$ years of each century in the overall time frame.  It remains to count how many leap years in the last $16$ years of each century start on a Monday or a Tuesday. Note that if year $x$ is a leap year, year $x+4$ will always start on the weekday two days earlier than year $x$, because $4(365)+1 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}$. Also, if year $x$ is not in the final century of a Gregorian cycle, year $x+100$ will also always start on the weekday two days earlier than year $x$, because $100(365) + 24 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}$. Finally, it can be seen that $1688$ starts on a Thursday in the Gregorian calendar. So:   $1692$ starts on a Tuesday and $1696$ starts on a Sunday (adding $1$ to the count).  $1788$ starts on a Tuesday , $1792$ starts on a Sunday, and $1796$ starts on a Friday (adding $1$ to the count).  $1888$ starts on a Sunday, $1892$ starts on a Friday, and $1896$ starts on a Wednesday (adding $0$ to the count).  $1988$ starts on a Friday, $1992$ starts on a Wednesday, $1996$ starts on a Monday , and $2000$ starts on a Saturday (adding 1 to the count).   Adding these to the $24$ from before gives a total of $27$ leap years that start on a Monday or Tuesday in a single calendar period. As there are $97$ leap years total in that period, the probability that a given one starts on a Monday or a Tuesday is $\dfrac{27}{97}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 27 '14 at 4:26       Micah   26.6k 13 50 95              1      You can simplify that calculation a bit by instead considering the period 1700 to 2199. Then the 49 regularly-spaced leap years from 1904 to 2196 split evenly between the weekdays, and then the only "sporadic" years you need to consider are three from the 1700s and three of the 1800s. -- Say, 1788, 1792, 1796, 1804, 1808, 1812. – Henning Makholm  Jan 27 '14 at 4:48             @HenningMakholm: Thanks, good point!

We've picked the day of the week we want to match.  The fact that we'd get the same answer if we chose Thursday or Saturday doesn't come into play. – John  Jan 27 '14 at 4:01            @John, thanks for the comment but I don't understand what you mean by "we already picked the day of the week we want to match?". So then what is the probability space that I am missing? – Cupitor  Jan 28 '14 at 10:33             Forgetting for a second that the distribution isn't uniform (see the upvoted answers), the probability of getting 53 Whateverdays in that year is $2/7$.  All of the probabilities are equal, but there is overlap with one of the other cases.  I can have 53 Mondays and 53 Tuesdays in one year.  I can also have 53 Tuesdays and 53 Wednesdays in one year.  Both of these cases imply 53 Tuesdays.  But the odds of having 53 Tuesdays is 2/7.  I picked which day I want to test. – John  Jan 28 '14 at 19:05        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      There will be 366 days in a leap year. 366/7 = 52 weeks + 2 additional days.

(a)1/7    (b) 2/7    (c) 5/7    (d)6/7   See Attachment   5 years ago      Answers : (8)      naninagaraju sivacharan  lakshmi narsing      34
                                Points       Sol. A non - leap year contains 365 days 52 weeks and 1 day more. i) We get 53 Sundays when the remaining day is Sunday. Number of days in week = 7 ∴ n(S) = 7 Number of ways getting 53 Sundays. n(E) = 1 n E 1 n S 7 = ∴ Probability of getting 53 Sundays =1/7    5 years ago   Disapproved       seethayya Barri      34
                                Points       A leap year has 366 days, therefore 52 weeks i.e. 52 Sunday and 2 days.  The remaining 2 days may be any of the following :  (i) Sunday and Monday  (ii) Monday and Tuesday  (iii) Tuesday and Wednesday  (iv) Wednesday and Thursday  (v) Thursday and Friday  (vi) Friday and Saturday  (vii) Saturday and Sunday  For having 53 Sundays in a year, one of the remaining 2 days must be a Sunday.  n(S) = 7  n(E) = 2  P(E) = n(E) / n(S) = 2 / 7    5 years ago     Approved       r vrao      15
                                Points       a leap year consits  of 366 days in those 364 days are completely 52 weeks so it contains 52 sundays remaining 2 days there are 2/7 probabilities are there.    5 years ago      A. Srikar      20

                                Points      In a Leap Year, there are 366 Days.366 Days = 52 Weeks and 2 DaysThus, a Leap Year has always 52 Sundays.The Remaining 2 Days can be :(i) Sunday & Monday ; (ii) Mon & Tue ; (iii) Tue & Wed ; (iv) Wed & Thu ; (v) Thu & Fri ; (vi) Fri & Sat ; (vii) Sat & Sun. Clearly there are 7 Elementary events associated. Let A be the event that a Leap Year has 53 Sundays.Clearly, the event A will happen if the last two days of the leap year are either Sun & Mon or Sat & Sun. Favourable Outcomes = 2Required Probability = 2/7.   one year ago    Think You Can Provide A Better Answer ?

In order to have 53 Sundays we should have either {Sat, Sun } or { Sun , Mon} case. The probability of that is 2/7. Answer: E. Hope it's clear. P.S.

So 52 Sundays will always be there in any year. A leap year has 366 days. 52 weeks = 52*7=364 days So we have 2 extra days apart from 52 weeks. These 2 days can be (Saturday, Sunday), (Sunday, Monday), (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), (Wednesday,Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday). For the year to have 53 Sundays, the 2 days must be either (Saturday, Sunday) or (Sunday, Monday) Favourable cases = 2 Total possible cases = 7 Propability = \(\frac{Favourable}{Total}\)= \(\frac{2}{7}\) Answer E                          rever08      Manager        B     Joined: 21 Jul 2017   Posts: 108   Location: India   Concentration: Social Entrepreneurship, Leadership   Schools:  INSEAD Jan'18 (S) , Oxford"19 (S) , ISB '19 (S)    GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V33     GPA: 4                      Re: Find the probability that a leap year selected at random [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     15 Sep 2017, 10:51      There are 366 days in a leap year that contain 52 weeks and 2 more days.

In order to have 53 Sundays we should have either {Sat, Sun } or { Sun , Mon} case. The probability of that is 2/7. Answer: E. Hope it's clear. P.S.

So 52 Sundays will always be there in any year. A leap year has 366 days. 52 weeks = 52*7=364 days So we have 2 extra days apart from 52 weeks. These 2 days can be (Saturday, Sunday), (Sunday, Monday), (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), (Wednesday,Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday). For the year to have 53 Sundays, the 2 days must be either (Saturday, Sunday) or (Sunday, Monday) Favourable cases = 2 Total possible cases = 7 Propability = \(\frac{Favourable}{Total}\)= \(\frac{2}{7}\) Answer E                          rever08      Manager        B     Joined: 21 Jul 2017   Posts: 108   Location: India   Concentration: Social Entrepreneurship, Leadership   Schools:  INSEAD Jan'18 (S) , Oxford"19 (S) , ISB '19 (S)    GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V33     GPA: 4                      Re: Find the probability that a leap year selected at random [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     15 Sep 2017, 10:51      There are 366 days in a leap year that contain 52 weeks and 2 more days.

Event that a Monday will come on the remaining 1 day: n(E) = 1 [E= {Monday}] Sample Space (no of Possibilities) n(S) = 7 [ S= {M,T,W,T,F,S,S} ] Therefore P= n(E)/n(S) = 1/7   for a Non leap year: No of days = 366 No of week = 52Week + 2 days so first 52weeks will surely have a monday. Event that a Monday will come on remaining 2 days: n(E) = 2 [E = { (Sun,Mon) / (Mon,Tue) } ] Sample Space (no of Possibilities) n(S) = 7 [S= { (Sun,Mon) (Mon,Tue) (Tue,Wed) (Wed,Thu) (Thu,Fri) (Fri,Sat) (Sat,Sun) } Therefore P= n(E)/n(S) = 2/7..        31       View Full Answer                    A leap year has 366 days. when 366 is divided by 7,you get 52 as quotient and 2 as remainder. Those 2 days can be MT,TW,WTh,ThF,FS,SSu,orSuM ​No of favourable outcomes=2 ​So,P(E)=2/7         16                           leap year has 366 days which is 52 weeks + 2 days there can be 53 sundays only when the last 2 days are    (saturday , sunday or sunday monday) so P(53 sundays)= 2/7 as total there can be 7 cases similarly P(53 mondays) = 2/7 P(53 sundays or 53 mondays)= P(53 sundays union 53 mondays)    = P(53 sundays)+ P(53 mondays) - P(53 sundays and 53 mondays) which is seen in only 1 case so P(53 sundays or 53 mondays)    = 2/7+2/7-1/7 = 3/7          7                         A non - leap year contains 365 days 52 weeks and 1 day more. i) We get 53 Sundays when the remaining day is Sunday. Number of days in week = 7 ∴ n(S) = 7 Number of ways getting 53 Sundays. n(E) = 1 n E 1 n S 7 = ∴ Probability of getting 53 Sundays =1/7        4                         2/7        3                         1/7 1/7        1                         it will be  2/7 and 2/7        0                         2/ 7        0                         Hope you understand it,          0                         366 days = 52 weeks + 2 days  2 days can be MT, TW, WT, TF, SS , SM =7  P=2/7  HOPE U UNDERSTAND .................        0                         2/7        0                         A leap year has 366 days So no: of weeks = 52 These 52 weeks surely have 52 sundays and 52 mondays  No: of remaining days = 2  These two days could be : {(Sun,Mon),  (Mon,Tue), (Tue, Wed), (Wed,Thur), (Thur,Fri), (Fri,Sat), (Sat,Sun)}  No: of favourable outcomes (i.e., the remaining 2 days are Sunday and Monday to make it 53 sundays and 53 mondays) = 1  Total possible ways = 7  Therefore, P(E) = 1/7         -1                         366 days ➗ 7days = 52 weeks and 2 days :
These two days can be 
Sunday monday
Monday tuesday
Tuesday wednesday 
Wednesday Thursday 
Thursday Friday 
Friday Saturday 
Saturday Sunday 
And therefore probability is 2/7        -1                         In a leap year ,total number of days =366

In 366 days there are 52 weeks and 2 days
Now two days may be
Sun and Mon
Mon andTue
Tue and Wed
Wed andThur
Thur and Fri
Fri and Sat
Sat and Sun

Now, in total 7 probabilities ,
Sun and Mon come together in one time

Hence there will be 52 Sundays for sure.  52 weeks = days  366 – 364 =2 days  In a leap year there will be 52 Sundays and 2 days will be left.  These 2 days can be:  1.  Sunday, Monday  2.  Monday, Tuesday  3.  Tuesday, Wednesday  4.  Wednesday, Thursday  5.  Thursday, Friday  6.  Friday, Saturday  7.  Saturday, Sunday  Of these total 7 outcomes, the favourable outcomes are 2.

Home  /  Green Board  /  Miscellaneous  /  Question                          Priti Saraf  2 years ago     Find the probability that a leap year, selected at random, will contain 53 Sundays.  A.  5 ⁄ 7  B.  4 ⁄ 7  C.  3 ⁄ 7  D.  2 ⁄ 7   Answer: Option D       Solution(By Examveda Team) There are 366 days in a leap year that contain 52 weeks and 2 more days. So, 52 Sundays and 2 days.  These 2 days can be: (Mon, Tue}, {Tue, Wed}, {Wed, Thu}, {Thu, Fri}, {Fri, Sat}, {Sat, Sun} and {Sun, Mon} (7 cases). In order to have 53 Sundays we should have either {Sat, Sun} or {Sun, Mon} case. No. of sample spaces = 7. No. of event that gives 53rd Sunday in Leap Year = 2.  Required Probability = 2 ⁄ 7 .         Join The Discussion     Comment *            Comments ( 2 )         Ruhi Mehra :   2 months ago    Thanx it helps me a lot           Kumar Chandan :   2 years ago    In a leap year, there are 366 days and 364days make 52 weeks and in each week there is 1 Sunday. Therefore, we have to find the probability of having 1 Sunday out of the remaining 2 days. Now, the 2 days can be (Sunday,Monday) or (Monday,Tuesday) or (Tuesday, Wednesday) or (Wednesday, Thursday) or (Thursday,Friday) or (Friday,Saturday) or (Saturday,Sunday). Note that Sunday occurs 2 times in these 7 pairs. Let the event be 'having a Sunday', then the number of favourable outcomes to the event = 2 Therefore, Probability(having 53 Sundays) = 2/7.

There are 366 days in a leap year, i.e, 1 more than a normal year.  Now, 52 weeks make up 344 days (52 x 7 = 344) That means that we already have 52 sundays for sure.  Then, we are left with 2 days. Now, these days can be any from a pair of- mon-tues,tues-wed,wed-thurs,thurs-fri,fri-sat,sat-sun,sun-mon. Here favourable cases are sat-sun and sun-mon i.e, 2 cases and total number of cases is 7.  So, Probability=number of favourable cases/Total number of cases.  Therefore, Probability= 2/7.         About the author   Yatharth R. is an online   tutor

The Solution goes :  For 53 Sundays, we proceed as: $\frac{366}{7} = 52.28$; So we can be sure that there are 52 Sundays, now the only question is of the 1 Sunday. So $7\cdot 52 = 364$. Therefore the remaining 2 days (366-364) decide the probability of being a Sunday. So we consider pairings of 2 consecutive days -   Sunday-Monday  Monday-Tuesday  Tuesday-Wednesday  Wednesday-Thursday  Thursday-Friday  Friday-Saturday  Saturday-Sunday   So out of the 7 pairs, we have 2 pairs that include a Sunday. Therefore the probability of having 53 Sundays in a Leap Year is $\frac{2}{7}$.  Then I was wondering, what if we ask "Probability that a leap year has 52 Sundays", Considering the above solution for 53 Sundays, the answer to the 52 Sundays problem should be 1. (Since $\frac{366}{7} = 52.28$) So we have complete 52 weeks and hence always 52 Sundays, therefore 1.  I found some online forums, where the answer to $52$ Sundays Problem is not 1. Hence my confusion.

Within these 400 years, there are 97 leap years, 28 of which start on a Saturday or Sunday; so the probability is $28/97\approx 0.28866$ rather than $2/7\approx 0.28571$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 7 '14 at 11:42       jpvee   2,439 2 12 25              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Probability that leap year has 52 Sundays is 5/7     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 21 '14 at 7:50       renu mehra   11 1              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      if it asked:"What is the Probability that a leap year has exactly 52 Sundays ?", than you can work with the converse probability.  greeting,  calculus     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 3 '14 at 14:57       callculus   14.9k 3 10 25                  So would that be 1 - P(atleast 52 Sundays)?

There are 52 Sundays in 52 weeks;
If either of the 2 extra days is Sunday then there will be 53 Sundays in a week;
Probability of any one of that extra days is Sunday = Probabilty of 53 Sundays in a week  =2/7;
Probability That any day of the 2 extra days is not sunday = Probability of only 52 Sundays in a week = 1 - 2/7

Imagine the year starts on a Saturday.  if there were only 52 Sundays, then that would mean that there are 365 days (53 Saturdays, 52 of everything else).  1972 is an example of such a year.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Dec 23 '13 at 2:04       Gaffney   1,383 6 12                  It makes a lot of  sense to me....

I say this because this year the year starts on a Friday and there are 53 Saturdays, but only 52 Sundays.  Whatever days are the 2 extra are the ones that will occur 53 times. In a non-leap year whichever day is the last and first will occur 53 times.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 6 '16 at 1:22       Chris Bush   1              add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      answer is $106$ ($52\times7=364$, $2$ days would be sat and sun)

This can't happen in 2/7 of all leap years, because the distribution of leap years and first-days-of-the year repeats every 400 years. There are 97 leap years in each such period, which is not a multiple of 7.  More precisely, in every 400-year period,   13 leap years start on a Monday  14 leap years start on a Tuesday  14 leap years start on a Wednesday  13 leap years start on a Thursday  15 leap years start on a Friday  13 leap years start on a Saturday  15 leap years start on a Sunday   So the probablility that a leap year chosen uniformly among the leap years in a cycle starts on a Monday or Tuesday (and so contains 53 Tuesdays) is
$$ \frac{13+14}{97} = \frac{27}{97} \qquad (= \tfrac27-\tfrac{5}{679}) $$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 27 '14 at 4:25             answered Jan 27 '14 at 4:02       Henning Makholm   214k 14 276 500                  Yeah, this is the best answer so far. – John  Jan 27 '14 at 4:09        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      The Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years (because there are 97 leap years every 400 years, and $400(365)+97$ is a multiple of $7$), so it suffices to count the number of leap years in the period from $1601$ to $2000$ that contain 53 Tuesdays.  In the first 84 years of each century, there will be 21 leap years (xx04, xx08, ..., xx84). Because these leap years occur at regular intervals, 3 of them will start on each day of the week. So 6 will start on a Monday or a Tuesday each century; this gives $24$ leap years that start on a Monday or a Tuesday in the first $84$ years of each century in the overall time frame.  It remains to count how many leap years in the last $16$ years of each century start on a Monday or a Tuesday. Note that if year $x$ is a leap year, year $x+4$ will always start on the weekday two days earlier than year $x$, because $4(365)+1 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}$. Also, if year $x$ is not in the final century of a Gregorian cycle, year $x+100$ will also always start on the weekday two days earlier than year $x$, because $100(365) + 24 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}$. Finally, it can be seen that $1688$ starts on a Thursday in the Gregorian calendar. So:   $1692$ starts on a Tuesday and $1696$ starts on a Sunday (adding $1$ to the count).  $1788$ starts on a Tuesday , $1792$ starts on a Sunday, and $1796$ starts on a Friday (adding $1$ to the count).  $1888$ starts on a Sunday, $1892$ starts on a Friday, and $1896$ starts on a Wednesday (adding $0$ to the count).  $1988$ starts on a Friday, $1992$ starts on a Wednesday, $1996$ starts on a Monday , and $2000$ starts on a Saturday (adding 1 to the count).   Adding these to the $24$ from before gives a total of $27$ leap years that start on a Monday or Tuesday in a single calendar period. As there are $97$ leap years total in that period, the probability that a given one starts on a Monday or a Tuesday is $\dfrac{27}{97}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 27 '14 at 4:26       Micah   26.6k 13 50 95              1      You can simplify that calculation a bit by instead considering the period 1700 to 2199.

All of the probabilities are equal, but there is overlap with one of the other cases.  I can have 53 Mondays and 53 Tuesdays in one year.  I can also have 53 Tuesdays and 53 Wednesdays in one year.  Both of these cases imply 53 Tuesdays.  But the odds of having 53 Tuesdays is 2/7.

(a)1/7    (b) 2/7    (c) 5/7    (d)6/7   See Attachment   5 years ago      Answers : (8)      naninagaraju sivacharan  lakshmi narsing      34
                                Points       Sol. A non - leap year contains 365 days 52 weeks and 1 day more. i) We get 53 Sundays when the remaining day is Sunday. Number of days in week = 7 ∴ n(S) = 7 Number of ways getting 53 Sundays. n(E) = 1 n E 1 n S 7 = ∴ Probability of getting 53 Sundays =1/7    5 years ago   Disapproved       seethayya Barri      34
                                Points       A leap year has 366 days, therefore 52 weeks i.e. 52 Sunday and 2 days.  The remaining 2 days may be any of the following :  (i) Sunday and Monday  (ii) Monday and Tuesday  (iii) Tuesday and Wednesday  (iv) Wednesday and Thursday  (v) Thursday and Friday  (vi) Friday and Saturday  (vii) Saturday and Sunday  For having 53 Sundays in a year, one of the remaining 2 days must be a Sunday.  n(S) = 7  n(E) = 2  P(E) = n(E) / n(S) = 2 / 7    5 years ago     Approved       r vrao      15
                                Points       a leap year consits  of 366 days in those 364 days are completely 52 weeks so it contains 52 sundays remaining 2 days there are 2/7 probabilities are there.    5 years ago      A. Srikar      20
                                Points       ans is b.  in leap yr der r 2 odd daysso probability for sunday to be one of them is 2 out of 7 as it may be Sunday,Monday or Saturday,Sunday    5 years ago      Praveen Rawla      24
                                Points      A leape year consists of 366 days Normal year consists of 365 days One year consists of 52 weeks One week consists of 7 days52×7= 36452 Sundays per year Extra 2 days So probability =2/7   one year ago      Akshay Chourdia      26
                                Points       366/7=(7*52)+2 these 2 days can be sunday monday monday tuesday tuesday wednesday wednesday thrusday thrusday friday friday saturday saturday sunday and 52 sunday are of probability 1 for 53 rd  sunday it should be saturday sunday or sunday monday p(sunday)=2/7    one year ago      supriya      11
                                Points      (monday,sunday),(Monday,tuesday),(Tuesday,wednesday)(Wednesday,thursday),(Friday,saturday)(Saturday,sunday). Possible outcome=2Total number of outcomes=7P(E)=2/7   one year ago      Subham Nandi      11
                                Points      In a Leap Year, there are 366 Days.366 Days = 52 Weeks and 2 DaysThus, a Leap Year has always 52 Sundays.The Remaining 2 Days can be :(i) Sunday & Monday ; (ii) Mon & Tue ; (iii) Tue & Wed ; (iv) Wed & Thu ; (v) Thu & Fri ; (vi) Fri & Sat ; (vii) Sat & Sun. Clearly there are 7 Elementary events associated. Let A be the event that a Leap Year has 53 Sundays.Clearly, the event A will happen if the last two days of the leap year are either Sun & Mon or Sat & Sun. Favourable Outcomes = 2Required Probability = 2/7.   one year ago    Think You Can Provide A Better Answer ?

So 52 Sundays will always be there in any year. A leap year has 366 days. 52 weeks = 52*7=364 days So we have 2 extra days apart from 52 weeks. These 2 days can be (Saturday, Sunday), (Sunday, Monday), (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), (Wednesday,Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday). For the year to have 53 Sundays, the 2 days must be either (Saturday, Sunday) or (Sunday, Monday) Favourable cases = 2 Total possible cases = 7 Propability = \(\frac{Favourable}{Total}\)= \(\frac{2}{7}\) Answer E                          rever08      Manager        B     Joined: 21 Jul 2017   Posts: 108   Location: India   Concentration: Social Entrepreneurship, Leadership   Schools:  INSEAD Jan'18 (S) , Oxford"19 (S) , ISB '19 (S)    GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V33     GPA: 4                      Re: Find the probability that a leap year selected at random [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     15 Sep 2017, 10:51      There are 366 days in a leap year that contain 52 weeks and 2 more days.

So 52 Sundays will always be there in any year. A leap year has 366 days. 52 weeks = 52*7=364 days So we have 2 extra days apart from 52 weeks. These 2 days can be (Saturday, Sunday), (Sunday, Monday), (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), (Wednesday,Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday). For the year to have 53 Sundays, the 2 days must be either (Saturday, Sunday) or (Sunday, Monday) Favourable cases = 2 Total possible cases = 7 Propability = \(\frac{Favourable}{Total}\)= \(\frac{2}{7}\) Answer E                          rever08      Manager        B     Joined: 21 Jul 2017   Posts: 108   Location: India   Concentration: Social Entrepreneurship, Leadership   Schools:  INSEAD Jan'18 (S) , Oxford"19 (S) , ISB '19 (S)    GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V33     GPA: 4                      Re: Find the probability that a leap year selected at random [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     15 Sep 2017, 10:51      There are 366 days in a leap year that contain 52 weeks and 2 more days. So, 52 Sundays and 2 days. These 2 days can be: (Mon, Tue}, {Tue, Wed}, {Wed, Thu}, {Thu, Fri}, {Fri, Sat}, {Sat, Sun} and {Sun, Mon} (7 cases). In order to have 53 Sundays we should have either {Sat, Sun} or {Sun, Mon} case. No. of sample spaces = 7. No. of event that gives 53rd Sunday in Leap Year = 2. Required Probability = 2⁄7.

Event that a Monday will come on the remaining 1 day: n(E) = 1 [E= {Monday}] Sample Space (no of Possibilities) n(S) = 7 [ S= {M,T,W,T,F,S,S} ] Therefore P= n(E)/n(S) = 1/7   for a Non leap year: No of days = 366 No of week = 52Week + 2 days so first 52weeks will surely have a monday.

Those 2 days can be MT,TW,WTh,ThF,FS,SSu,orSuM ​No of favourable outcomes=2 ​So,P(E)=2/7         16                           leap year has 366 days which is 52 weeks + 2 days there can be 53 sundays only when the last 2 days are    (saturday , sunday or sunday monday) so P(53 sundays)= 2/7 as total there can be 7 cases similarly P(53 mondays) = 2/7 P(53 sundays or 53 mondays)= P(53 sundays union 53 mondays)    = P(53 sundays)+ P(53 mondays) - P(53 sundays and 53 mondays) which is seen in only 1 case so P(53 sundays or 53 mondays)    = 2/7+2/7-1/7 = 3/7          7                         A non - leap year contains 365 days 52 weeks and 1 day more. i) We get 53 Sundays when the remaining day is Sunday. Number of days in week = 7 ∴ n(S) = 7 Number of ways getting 53 Sundays. n(E) = 1 n E 1 n S 7 = ∴ Probability of getting 53 Sundays =1/7        4                         2/7        3                         1/7 1/7        1                         it will be  2/7 and 2/7        0                         2/ 7        0                         Hope you understand it,          0                         366 days = 52 weeks + 2 days  2 days can be MT, TW, WT, TF, SS , SM =7  P=2/7  HOPE U UNDERSTAND .................        0                         2/7        0                         A leap year has 366 days So no: of weeks = 52 These 52 weeks surely have 52 sundays and 52 mondays  No: of remaining days = 2  These two days could be : {(Sun,Mon),  (Mon,Tue), (Tue, Wed), (Wed,Thur), (Thur,Fri), (Fri,Sat), (Sat,Sun)}  No: of favourable outcomes (i.e., the remaining 2 days are Sunday and Monday to make it 53 sundays and 53 mondays) = 1  Total possible ways = 7  Therefore, P(E) = 1/7         -1                         366 days ➗ 7days = 52 weeks and 2 days :
These two days can be 
Sunday monday
Monday tuesday
Tuesday wednesday 
Wednesday Thursday 
Thursday Friday 
Friday Saturday 
Saturday Sunday 
And therefore probability is 2/7        -1                         In a leap year ,total number of days =366

In 366 days there are 52 weeks and 2 days
Now two days may be
Sun and Mon
Mon andTue
Tue and Wed
Wed andThur
Thur and Fri
Fri and Sat
Sat and Sun

Now, in total 7 probabilities ,
Sun and Mon come together in one time

Thank you for posting your comment.                       person     Kishore , Student  Member since Dec 10 2008         Solution:  1 year = 365 days  A leap year has 366 days  A year has 52 weeks. Hence there will be 52 Sundays for sure.  52 weeks = days  366 – 364 =2 days  In a leap year there will be 52 Sundays and 2 days will be left.  These 2 days can be:  1.  Sunday, Monday  2.  Monday, Tuesday  3.  Tuesday, Wednesday  4.  Wednesday, Thursday  5.  Thursday, Friday  6.  Friday, Saturday  7.  Saturday, Sunday  Of these total 7 outcomes, the favourable outcomes are 2.

Home  /  Green Board  /  Miscellaneous  /  Question                          Priti Saraf  2 years ago     Find the probability that a leap year, selected at random, will contain 53 Sundays.  A.  5 ⁄ 7  B.  4 ⁄ 7  C.  3 ⁄ 7  D.  2 ⁄ 7   Answer: Option D       Solution(By Examveda Team) There are 366 days in a leap year that contain 52 weeks and 2 more days. So, 52 Sundays and 2 days.  These 2 days can be: (Mon, Tue}, {Tue, Wed}, {Wed, Thu}, {Thu, Fri}, {Fri, Sat}, {Sat, Sun} and {Sun, Mon} (7 cases). In order to have 53 Sundays we should have either {Sat, Sun} or {Sun, Mon} case. No. of sample spaces = 7. No. of event that gives 53rd Sunday in Leap Year = 2.  Required Probability = 2 ⁄ 7 .         Join The Discussion     Comment *            Comments ( 2 )         Ruhi Mehra :   2 months ago    Thanx it helps me a lot           Kumar Chandan :   2 years ago    In a leap year, there are 366 days and 364days make 52 weeks and in each week there is 1 Sunday. Therefore, we have to find the probability of having 1 Sunday out of the remaining 2 days. Now, the 2 days can be (Sunday,Monday) or (Monday,Tuesday) or (Tuesday, Wednesday) or (Wednesday, Thursday) or (Thursday,Friday) or (Friday,Saturday) or (Saturday,Sunday). Note that Sunday occurs 2 times in these 7 pairs. Let the event be 'having a Sunday', then the number of favourable outcomes to the event = 2 Therefore, Probability(having 53 Sundays) = 2/7.
