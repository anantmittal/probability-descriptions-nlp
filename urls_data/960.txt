Eric Thayer/Getty Images It's official: the country's top regulator of the internet wants to end net neutrality. Specifically, Federal Communications Commission chair Ajit Pai plans to repeal changes that gave the agency the authority to enforce net neutrality protections—that is, rules requiring internet service providers to treat all internet traffic equally. But he won't likely be able to do so without a big legal fight. During a speech today in Washington, Pai announced his intention to undo one of the Obama-era FCC's signature achievements. Although he was light on specifics (he plans to release the full text of his proposal tomorrow), Pai made clear that he would seek to reverse an FCC decision to classify broadband internet access providers as "Title II" common carriers, putting them in the same category as traditional telephone companies. The re-classification gave the FCC authority to impose net neutrality requirements on both wireless and home broadband providers, preventing them from, for example, charging specific sites or companies fees for sending traffic over their networks or slowing down competitors' streaming video offerings.

"Going forward, we cannot stick with regulations from the Great Depression meant to micromanage Ma Bell," Pai said. The FCC will vote on—and given its Republican majority, likely pass—the proposal during an open meeting May 18. But that will only start what promises to be a lengthy battle for the future of net neutrality. To truly torpedo the requirements, Pai will have to make the case that he's doing so for good reason. A 1946 law called the Administrative Procedure Act bans federal agencies making "capricious" decisions. The law is meant, in part, to keep regulations from yo-yoing back and forth every time a new party gained control of the White House. The FCC successfully argued in favor of Title II reclassification in federal court just last summer . That effort means Pai might have to make the case that things had changed enough since then to justify a complete reversal in policy. "That's a pretty dramatic reversal," says Marc Martin, chair of communications law at Perkins Coie. "Presuming there's an appeal, a court may find that arbitrary." Staying Neutral Based both on his speech today and previous remarks , it appears that Pai will make the case that Title II reclassification led to a substantial decline in broadband infrastructure investment. Pai says that internet providers large and small are spending less money upgrading their networks and expanding into new markets because of the supposed regulatory burden. "Just this week, 22 small ISPs, each of which has about 1,000 broadband customers or fewer, told the FCC that the Title II order had affected their ability to obtain financing," Pai said. "They said it had slowed, if not halted, the development and deployment of innovative new offerings which would benefit our customers." Indeed, the industry group US Telecom estimates that broadband investment dipped from about $77 billion in 2014 to $76 billion in 2015. But those numbers are in dispute. During a hearing earlier this year, senator Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts) pointed to US Census Bureau estimates that broadband investment increased slightly from $86.6 in 2014 to $87.2 billion in 2015. (Neither organization has published investment data on 2016 yet.) 'We cannot stick with regulations from the Great Depression meant to micromanage Ma Bell.' FCC Chair Ajit Pai In either case, the difference doesn't amount to a significant change, presenting Pai with what would seem to be a challenge in arguing Title II reclassification was the real reason for a purported drop. Other business considerations could also play into changes in telecom spending on network infrastructure, such as a desire to wait and let previous investments pay for themselves before making new ones. The CEO of Verizon , for example, told shareholders that Title II didn't affect the company's investment plans. And Martin points out that a recent auction in which companies spent $19.8 billion to buy rights to use more of the wireless spectrum doesn't exactly look like an industry shy of investing. If the infrastructure argument doesn't fly, Pai could also argue that the rules are unnecessary because proverbial fast and slow lanes for the internet never existed. The problem is that's not true. The Bush-era FCC ordered Comcast to stop throttling BitTorrent traffic in 2008, for one. But that's not all. Under a secret agreement with AT&T, Apple blocked iPhone users from making Skype calls over the carrier's network until the FCC pressured the companies into reversing the policy in 2009. And in 2012, AT&T blocked some users from using Apple's Face Time on its network. Had Comcast, and later Verizon, not argued in court that the FCC had no authority to stop them from blocking and throttling content, then the agency might never have needed to pass Title II reclassification in the first place. Even if Pai's attempts to undo Title II classification fail, Congress could undo the agency's authority to enforce net neutrality regulations. Senate Democrats can't do much about Pai's proposal, but they are already vowing a "tsunami of resistance" if their colleagues across the aisle try to act. It's not clear whether that promised tidal wave includes a filibuster. Either way, whether in the courts or the legislature, the fight to save net neutrality is far from over. #FCC #Net Neutrality Most Popular gear 4 Best Smartphones of 2018: Guide to Android, Samsung Galaxy, iPhone Author: Jeffrey Van Camp Jeffrey Van Camp gear How to Check If Cambridge Analytica Could Access Your Facebook Data Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett transportation Porsche's 919 Hybrid Evo Wallops F1's Fastest Cars Author: Jack Stewart Jack Stewart More Stories View Comments Sponsored Stories Powered By Outbrain Issie Lapowsky Facebook Exposed 87 Million Users to Cambridge Analytica Louise Matsakis Police Say YouTube Policies Motivated Shooter Louise Matsakis The Cryptocurrency Industry Might Actually Benefit From an Ad Ban Erin Griffith Spotify and the Triumph of the Subscription Model Issie Lapowsky YouTube Shooting Spree Injures 4, Kills 1 More business social media Mark Zuckerberg Answers to Congress For Facebook's Troubles Author: Issie Lapowsky Issie Lapowsky facebook Watch Mark Zuckerberg Testify Before Congress Right Here Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett COPPA Groups Allege YouTube Is Violating Law That Protects Kids Author: Nitasha Tiku Nitasha Tiku WIRED Opinion Beyond Facebook: It’s High Time for Stronger Privacy Laws Author: Jessica Rich Jessica Rich security roundup The US Gets Tough With Putin's Inner Circle Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett Law Enforcement Feds Seize Backpage.com, Site Linked to Sex Trafficking Author: Nitasha Tiku Nitasha Tiku We Recommend Powered By Outbrain Issie Lapowsky Facebook Imposes New Restrictions on Ads and Popular Pages Nitasha Tiku One Woman Got Facebook to Police Opioid Sales On Instagram Tom Simonite Google Turns to Users to Improve Its AI Chops Outside the US Issie Lapowsky The Question Only Mark Zuckerberg Can Answer Before Congress Tom Simonite Ex-Google Executive Opens a School for AI, With China's Help Get Our Newsletter WIRED’s biggest stories delivered to your inbox. submit Subscribe Advertise Site Map Press Center FAQ Accessibility Help Customer Care Contact Us Securedrop T-Shirt Collection Newsletter Wired Staff Jobs RSS CNMN Collection Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement (effective 3/21/12) and privacy policy (effective 3/21/12).

Congress Will Pay the Price Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images FCC chair Ajit Pai’s plan to repeal net neutrality provisions and reclassify broadband providers from “common carriers” to “information services” is an unprecedented giveaway to big broadband providers and a danger to the internet. The move would mean the FCC would have almost no oversight authority over broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. WIRED OPINION ABOUT Ryan Singel ( @rsingel ) is media and strategy fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and the CEO/cofounder of Contextly. For years, those broadband providers have used lawsuits and agency filings to fight FCC oversight and overturn its authority to prevent net neutrality abuses. But never in those companies’ most feverish dreams did they expect an FCC chair would propose to demolish all net neutrality protections and allow ISPs to extract tolls from every business in the country. Even industry analysts who expected the reclassification of broadband providers from Title II common carriers to Title I information services were stunned. Following Pai’s announcement, independent cable analyst Craig Moffett sent out an email to investors entitled "Shock and Awe and Net Neutrality," writing , “We've known since the election that the FCC would reverse Title II. But we never expected this . Yesterday’s FCC Draft Order on Net Neutrality went much further than we ever could've imagined in not only reversing Title II, but in dismantling virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.” If Congress allows Pai’s plan to pass, all that will be left of FCC oversight of broadband providers is a weak disclosure requirement: If Verizon, for example, wants to block content, charge sites to be viewable on its network, or create paid fast lanes, the company will simply have to tell its subscribers in their contract’s fine print. (Broadband providers won’t have to disclose, and the FCC won’t have control over, the sneakier ways they’ve found to mess with the internet.) Enforcement will be left to the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that’s never enforced open internet rules and has no ability to formulate its own. The FTC won’t even be able to protect consumers against most net neutrality violations after the fact, and nor will it be able to protect consumers against greedy broadband providers. And violations will come if Pai’s plan passes. AT&T's Ed Whitacre summarized broadband providers’ true motivations best back in 2005 : “Why should they be allowed to use my pipes?" he said. "The internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes free is nuts.” Verizon echoed that sentiment in 2013 when it sued to challenge the 2010 open internet rules. It told a federal court that as an “information service” it had the right to charge online services like Yelp access fees simply to work on its network and should be able block those sites from Verizon subscribers if Yelp didn’t pay. (Verizon won that case, leading to the 2015 order and the reclassification of broadband providers as “common carriers.”) The 2015 order, replacing the one Verizon had overturned, recognized this as a threat and prohibited ISPs from charging sites and services simply to reach their users. Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, thinks this would be innovative. Now his plan would usher in a radical upending of how the internet has worked in the US since its inception. Every website could have to pay more to simply be online; prices for online services would likely rise as companies start to pay broadband providers to be in fast lanes, while broadband providers would find even sneakier ways to enact tolls on the internet, free of any agency able to set rules to stop them.

Today, small and medium-size businesses rely on a myriad online business services for internal communications, sales, and accounting, to name just a few. Slack, Dropbox, Gusto, Quickbooks, and thousands more would have to pay access charges and fast-lane fees, costs they would likely have to pass to their customers. Non-mainstream media news sources across the political spectrum would no longer be able to afford to compete in the marketplace of ideas. Even churches that now reach their members online with streaming sermons, video libraries, and online video chats, would no longer be protected from blocking or access fees. Americans understand this and are rightly freaking out. Since the order was released, they’ve flooded Congress with more than half a million calls, and that’s only counting calls placed through the site BattleForTheNet.com. The citizen outrage crosses party lines; net neutrality is more popular than both parties combined . A poll this summer found that 77 percent of Americans support the current protections, including 73 percent of Republicans. This is not surprising. History has shown that internet freedom is the new third rail of US politics. In 2012, a bipartisan majority of Congress was dead set on passing SOPA , a law ostensibly intended to stop online copyright infringement but which would have threatened huge swaths of the internet. All conventional wisdom said it was a done deal. Then, freedom-loving people of the internet melted representatives' phone lines after a day of online action in January 2012. Even SOPA’s biggest supporters had to concede the internet killed SOPA. When online bots poisoned the net neutrality comment period, FCC chair Ajit Pai shrugged it off. In 2014, when the FCC set out to replace the struck-down 2010 net neutrality protections, conventional D.C. wisdom suggested that preserving net neutrality by designating broadband companies as common carriers was politically impossible. But millions of Americans proved otherwise. When TV host John Oliver pleaded with viewers to contact the FCC in support of net neutrality, they responded at such volume that the agency’s website crashed. That resulted in a win: limited but well-defined FCC net neutrality rules which, for the first time in FCC history, survived court challenges. Then in March, Congressional Republicans used a little-known legislative tool to repeal FCC rules that required broadband providers to get permission to track their subscribers’ every moves online for advertising purposes. That vote blew up in their faces when Republicans came back to their districts and held town hall meetings, where the politicians’ arguments that they voted to strike down the rule because it didn’t apply to online companies like Google did little to appease voter anger. That’s already likely to be an issue in the 2018 midterms. So far senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) is the only Republican member of Congress who has explicitly criticized Pai’s plan and has come out on the side of the internet. As the appointed head of an independent agency, Pai is technically free to ignore the American public. He’s done just that, saying that he doesn’t care about public sentiment. Pai did nothing when online bots poisoned the net neutrality comment period and posted anti net neutrality submissions using Americans’ names without their permission or knowledge. Instead of taking this corruption of a democratic process seriously, Pai shrugged it off . And while the FCC held multiple public hearings with participation from experts during previous net neutrality actions in 2008, 2010, and 2015, this time around Pai didn’t hold a single one. Voters know Republicans in Congress are the only ones who can stop Pai, and they should keep calling . If enough Republicans tell Pai to stop, he will likely back down. After all, congressional pressure has stopped the FCC before. Members of Congress face a choice: They can side with their constituents, who overwhelmingly want them to defend the greatest communication and innovation platform ever invented, or support one of the most blatant anticonsumer corporate giveaways in modern history. Some lawmakers believe the current FCC protections are the right solution, and others think that Congress should step in with a legislative solution to settle the matter once and for all. But all should agree that Pai’s plan to repeal the protections without a replacement is reckless and unnecessary. There’s no crisis Pai needs to save us from. The only crisis looming is the one that Pai’s plan will create for entrepreneurs, free markets, free speech, and for Republican members of Congress running for reelection who didn’t make the choice to stop Pai when they had the chance.

Nothing short of an extinction-level event will prevent it. But before abandoning all hope, know that while the battle for net neutrality at the FCC may have been lost, the war isn’t even close to a conclusion. In reality, the net neutrality fight is merely migrating to a different theater, namely, the US Courts of Appeals. And excluding the possibility of a Supreme Court challenge, the outcome may very well drag on for another year and a half or more. In roughly two weeks, the FCC’s three Republican commissioners, led by its chairman, Ajit Pai, will vote to adopt what’s known as the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. As the minority, the two Democrats who serve on the commission, both of which favor net neutrality, will be powerless to stop them. This order will replace and reverse the Open Internet Order, which was passed in 2015 and reclassified broadband internet service under Title II of the Communications Act—the legal foundation upon which the former administration established the “open internet” regulations imposed on internet service providers (ISPs). After the vote Without net neutrality, ISPs like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon will legally be able to conduct their businesses very differently than they do now. For example, they could give preferential treatment to services they directly profit from and block those they don’t, all the while charging internet companies like Netflix additional fees for speedier access to consumers—costs that you can count on being reflected in your monthly billing statement. Advertisement While several major ISPs have essentially promised never to do any these terrible, no good, very bad things, they’ve steadily opposed any law that would actually stop them. (Comcast actually deleted its promise after Pai announced the vote, Ars Technica reported Wednesday.) Publicly, ISPs claim the rules hinder innovation, a talking point frequently echoed by the FCC’s majority. Privately, we’ve learned, stockholders are being told the exact opposite . To be clear, when the FCC says that it is “restoring internet freedom,” it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers. The FCC’s new order, which seeks to abdicate its own authority to regulate an entire industry—not something you see every day—is unlikely to surface immediately after the vote. The two Democrats on the commission, Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, will likely file dissents, or minority reports detailing why, specifically, they disagree with the 200-page order (a draft of which was released last week .) And when they do, Pai and his two fellow Republican commissioners, Michael O’Rielly and Brendan Carr, will likely take some time to counter those concerns in print, if only in preparation for the long legal battle that lies ahead. Advertisement Afterwards, a brief period of legal chaos will ensue. Or at least, it will appear that way to anyone who hasn’t spent  a decade with their face buried in legal textbooks. For certain, there will be numerous lawsuits—or “petitions for review,” more specifically—filed in reaction to the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. “...if you file too soon it doesn’t count, but if you miss the deadline you lose your opportunity to choose the court.” We can’t be sure of how many tech companies, trade associations, and interest groups will avail themselves of judicial system and demand scrutiny of the FCC’s plan, but we know that many will seek an outright reversal of the order. Others may challenge only portions of the order, such as the provisions which “preempt” state and local governments that may try to pass their own laws to protect consumers from ISP abuse. Advertisement For many attorneys it’s “wait and see.” Much of the courtroom strategy, which no one is eager to reveal this early in the game, may be determined by the venue. That brings us to the first skirmish in this grueling legal process: Where will net neutrality’s fate be decided? While the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has heard three net neutrality cases in the past few years and therefore seems more appropriate, the case could theoretically wind up in one of eleven other circuit courts. In many ways it’s like winning the lottery, literally speaking. The fight over jurisdiction Petitions asking the courts to review the FCC’s order will be filed with appellate courts across the US. But only one court can hear the case. The process to determine which is, as one litigator described it, a “lawyer fight.” Organizations that want to be involved in the suit will have 60 days to file, but they’ll have only 10 days to get involved if they want a say in where the case will be heard. Advertisement It’s not immediately clear when that 10-day window opens. In some cases, it’s opened the minute the FCC publishes the order; in others, the attorneys have had to wait until after the order is added to the federal register—the government’s daily journal in which all rules, proposed rules, and public notices are published. “The statute is kind of weird,”  Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Gizmodo. “You’re not allowed to file until the order is ‘final’ so if you file too soon it doesn’t count, but if you miss the deadline you lose your opportunity to choose the court.” To avoid any confusion, the litigants who are truly determined to have a say in jurisdiction are likely to file  what’s called a “protective filing” at the earliest possible date—only to file again after the order hits the federal register, which may take a couple of weeks. Advertisement The multidistrict lottery The reason for this 10-day window—during which all filings are considered to have been filed simultaneously—is pretty simple: In days past, jurisdiction was determined by whomever filed first. But with lawyers filing in multiple states simultaneously, the process for deciding which attorney crossed the finish line first became unrealistic. And so the courts decided to leave it up to chance. After the 10-day window, each circuit district in which a lawsuit has been filed is entered into a lottery held by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation . “They plug into a computer the circuits which are competing and it picks a random number and that’s where they then assign all of the cases,” Feld said. Each circuit court is only entered into the lottery once, regardless of how many individual suits were filed there. Advertisement While the FCC does not have a say in this process (they aren’t suing themselves) there is an opportunity for those who oppose net neutrality to get involved—but only if they’re willing to object to some provision in the FCC’s order. Gigi Sohn, a former counsel to ex-FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, said the draft order didn’t appear to contain anything the ISPs would be eager to appeal at first blush. “I’m sure they’ll try to find something,” she said. By finding some small point to sue over, she added, the ISPs  can increase the odds of getting the case into a more favorable court. But this could also backfire, others say. “If they were to do something like that, it might carry the unfortunate perception of forum shopping on their part,” said Pantelis Michalopoulos, a telecom partner at the law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP. Advertisement Challenging the lottery “Even then it’s not over,” said Matt Wood, policy director at Free Press, one the interest groups that has already declared its intent to combat the order. “People can make motions to the court that it lands in to transfer it to another court.” Wood continued: “It’s not always the case that a court wants to surrender jurisdiction, especially over a high-profile item, but if you can make a case that this is really the same case that was heard in the DC circuit last time around, or because I’m here—whoever I am, some party—and my standing is especially good and this venue is especially relevant. You can make those arguments.” In other words, if the lottery selects, for instance, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which includes the the states Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Tennessee, one or more of the parties involved may, hypothetically, argue that the DC court is better equipped due its experience handling net neutrality cases. But how that would play out for either side is a bit of a toss up. Advertisement “It’s interesting, because until Obama appointed a couple of new judges, the DC circuit was considered to be very anti-regulatory and very pro-business,” Feld said. But that largely changed in 2014 after Obama appointed three judges who typically deferred to the agency. “Does that mean they’ll defer to the agency again? That’s an interesting strategic question,” Feld continued. “The other thing is, you have a bunch of precedent now in the DC circuit that arguably is very favorable to those who want to oppose what the FCC is doing, and unfavorable to the FCC.” Of course, the FCC could draw a panel of friendly conservative judges in DC and have a breezy time of it. But whether a challenge like this will occur or what effect the venue will have on the case is largely a matter of speculation for now. Advertisement “It’s like everything in government... It’s never really over. It’s not supposed to be.” As for any parties who didn’t participate in this initial scramble, they’ll still have that 60-day window to join the case, or else as an intervener—a non-party the court grants may be affected by the outcome, on either side of the case. This could mean a trade group representing tech giants like Google or Netflix—if they don’t join the lawsuit itself, which they certainly may—or it could be a group representing AT&T, Verizon and the like. Court convenes When we eventually get to court, one or more of the litigants, perhaps one of the smaller tech companies that joins the suit, may ask the court to issue a preliminary injunction, or what the appellate courts called a “stay.” If granted, this would prevent the FCC’s order, or perhaps just portions of it, from going into effect until the court renders a decision. Advertisement The challenge for anyone seeking a stay, however, lies not in demonstrating long-term harm from the rules, but imminent and irreparable injury. For this reason, many experts believe it is unlikely the ISPs will jump at the opportunity to launch any new business plans taking advantage of their newfound freedom. Doing so could inadvertently aid anyone petitioning for a stay, providing them with a real-life example of how the ISPs new behavior will irreparably damage their business. The remainder of the case should play out rather simply, though it remains unclear whether the parties opposing the FCC will be bundled together, or able to argue their cases independently. This depends on the rules of the court in which they convene and, potentially, on whether or not the litigants’ complaints about the order are dramatically divergent. Regardless, we’ll hear (or read, at least, since recording devices are banned in the DC court and others) a series of oral arguments for and against Pai’s order. Advertisement Outside parties will also have the opportunity to file amicus briefs, also known as “friend of the court” briefs, defending or opposing points of the order. The decision “The important thing to know about this process is really related to the merits,” said Michalopoulos, who spoke to Gizmodo last week shortly before the draft order was released. “If the FCC order is consistent with what has been reported, and what the chairman statements suggest, it is likely to be very vulnerable on appeal. So while it may take a long time, that’s the key fact about the appellate process. At the end of a long tunnel, there may well be a decision that disagrees with the order.” Advertisement In the case that court does not side entirely with the FCC, that decision may be an outright reversal of the order, a remand to the agency for further proceedings, or just a partial remand. In other words, there’s a distinct possibility that only portions of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order will be reversed. Or maybe none of it. “It’s like everything in government, especially in administrative processes and rulemakings,” Wood said. “It’s never really over. It’s not supposed to be. It’s a continuing conversation.” And there’s always the chance this ends up in the hands of the Supreme Court, whose makeup by that time may be entirely different. The judicial review of Pai’s order could very well extend into the next White House administration. The war for net neutrality in other words has only just begun.

Here’s what happens next.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email             Video by Liz Scheltens and Mallory Brangan    The Federal Communications Commission has voted to repeal net neutrality , despite overwhelming public support for the regulation, which requires internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast to distribute internet access fairly and equally to everyone, regardless of how much  they pay or where they’re located.  Despite last-minute requests to delay the December 14 vote from some Republican members of Congress, it went through as scheduled, thanks to the support of a much longer list of Republicans who favored the repeal and urged the vote to be held without delay. As had been heavily predicted for months , the vote was split 3-2 along party lines, with the FCC chair Ajit Pai and the other Republican members Michael O’Rielly and Brendan Carr voting for repeal and Democratic commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel voting to protect it.  The vote to repeal came in spite of overwhelming bipartisan support for net neutrality from the public, as the FCC was clearly determined to move ahead with the repeal. Tensions were high during the hearing — and at one point, in the middle of Pai’s remarks, the room was evacuated for about 10 minutes due to an apparent security threat.    We are being evacuated by security during net neutrality vote at FCC — CeciliaKang (@ceciliakang) December 14, 2017     The implications of the repeal are vast and complicated. If it’s left unchallenged, it will almost certainly fundamentally change how people access and use the internet. But it could be a long time before we start to see the full effects of the FCC’s vote — and there’s even a ghost of a chance that the repeal might be overturned by the US Court of Appeals.  Here’s what you need to know about what could happen next.          Protesters at a 2015 net neutrality rally .  Media Action Grassroots Network    1) What was the FCC actually voting on?  The FCC voted on the Restoring Internet Freedom Order , which concerned the repeal of Title II protection for net neutrality.  Title II is a decades-old regulatory clause that explicitly classifies internet service providers (ISPs) as telecommunications companies, meaning they’re essentially classified as utilities and subject to the same regulations that other telecommunication companies — also classified as utilities — must abide by. That basic regulatory standard is what people are referring to when they talk about net neutrality. Title II was first applied to ISPs in 2015, after a hard-won fight by internet activists.  Placing ISPs under Title II was the only legal way — barring the unlikely introduction and passage  of Congressional legislation instituting complicated new regulatory procedures — in which these companies could be regulated. Now that the FCC has repealed Title II classification for ISPs, the ISPs will essentially be unregulated.  2) Why does it matter if ISPs are regulated or not?  Classifying ISPs as utility companies under Title II meant they had to treat the internet like every other utility — that is, just like gas, water, or phone service — and that they couldn’t cut off service at will or control how much of it any one person received based on how much that person paid for it. The idea was that the internet should be a public service that everyone has a right to use, not a privilege, and that regulating ISPs like utilities would prevent them from hijacking or monopolize that access.  The best argument for the rollback of this Title II protection is that maybe the internet isn’t a public service — maybe it’s just another product, and in a free market system, competition over who gets to sell you that product would ensure accountability and fair treatment among providers, if only due to economic self-interest .   Related  "Net neutrality is the secret sauce that has made the internet awesome"   But there’s a huge problem with that argument, which is that, as far as the internet is concerned, there really isn’t a free and open market . In the United States, competition among ISPs was driven down years ago thanks to the consolidated nature of internet broadband infrastructure, which has typically been owned by major corporations, shutting out local ISP competitors.  That’s why many people don’t really have much choice about which company they pay for internet access — that access has been monopolized by a handful of powerful companies. In fact, nearly 50 million households have only one high-speed ISP in their area.   Related  Net neutrality isn’t the only way to keep the internet fair. It’s just the only way in America.   In other words, these particular utility companies, now unregulated, have free reign to behave like the corporate monopolies they are. Where net neutrality ensured the preservation of what’s been dubbed “the open internet,” its repeal will open the door for ISPs to create “ an internet for the elite .”  3) What will happen to the internet without net neutrality protections in place?  Net neutrality mandated that ISPs display all websites, at the same speed, to all sources of internet traffic. Without net neutrality, all bets are off.  That means ISPs will be free to control what you access on the internet, meaning they will be able to block access to specific websites and pieces of software that interact with the internet.  They might charge you more or less money to access specific “bundles” of certain websites, much as cable television providers do now — but instead of “basic cable,” you might be forced to pay for access to more than a “basic” number of websites, as this popular pro-net neutrality graphic illustrates:          ISPs will also be able to control how quickly you’re served webpages, how quickly you can download and upload things, and in what contexts you can access which websites, depending on how much money you pay them.  They’ll be able to  charge you more to access sites you currently visit for free, cap how much data you’re allowed to use, redirect you from sites you are trying to use to sites they want you to use instead, and block you from being able to access apps, products, and information offered by their competitors or other companies they don’t like.  They can even block you from being able to access information on certain topics, news events, or issues they don’t want you to know about.  Finally, they’ll be able to exert this power not just over individual consumers, but over companies, as well. This could result in the much-discussed “ internet fast lane ” — in which an ISP forces a company like Twitter or BitTorrent to pay more for faster access for readers or users like you to its websites and services. Larger, more powerful companies likely won’t be hurt by this change. Smaller companies and websites almost definitely will be.  We already have a good idea of how these scenarios might play out, because in the era before net neutrality existed, ISPs tried instituting all of them: via jacked-up fees , forced redirection , content-blocking , software-blocking , website-blocking , competitor-blocking and still more competitor-blocking , app-blocking and still more app-blocking , data-capping , and censorship of controversial subjects .  If net neutrality advocates have made it seem like there’s simply no end to the worst-case scenarios that unregulated ISPs might subject us to, it’s because they’ve learned from experience. This history of ISP exploitation is a major reason that advocates for net neutrality fought so hard for it to begin with.  We also know that many ISPs, notably Comcast , already have their eyes on the aforementioned “fast lane,” also known as “paid prioritization.” (Disclaimer: Comcast is an investor in Vox’s parent company, Vox Media, through its NBC-Universal arm.)  And lest you believe that the current FCC is prepared to make sure that such offenses are fully sanctioned and dealt with by the government, think again. FCC chair Pai is a vocal proponent of letting ISPs self-regulate, and seems perfectly content to ignore their contentious and often predatory history.  Not only that, but the FCC is explicitly preventing state consumer protection laws from taking effect regarding net neutrality. That means that once the repeal is final, the rights of states to govern themselves won’t apply to protecting net neutrality. (Though California and Washington each vowed after the vote to try to protect it anyway.)  4) Who will be most affected by the repeal of net neutrality?  Women, minorities, rural communities, and internet developers will feel the fullest effects of this repeal.  The general argument among net neutrality advocates is that without an open internet, members of society who have historically been marginalized and silenced will be in danger of being further marginalized and silenced, or marginalized and silenced once more — particularly women and minorities .  We’ve seen in the past that ISPs can and will censor access to controversial subjects. Without regulation, situations could arise in which underprivileged or disenfranchised individuals and groups have less access to speak up or contact others online.  One worst-case scenario that we haven’t yet seen in America, but which is worth considering given the current heated political climate, is that ISPs could potentially play a role in limiting or marginalizing certain communities during times of urgency — for instance, an ISP might choose to block a mobilizing hashtag like #BlackLivesMatter at the start of an organic protest.  This might seem like a dire prediction, but there’s precedent for it: In 2011, the Egyptian government heavily censored certain websites during the Arab Spring. And in Turkey, under the administration of President Erdogan, the country has become notorious for censoring websites and blocking hashtags, at one point banning Twitter altogether .  Rural areas of the US — where internet access is already scarce due to a lack of ISPs operating there — will be further subjected to corporatization and monopolization of their internet infrastructure.  More than 10 million Americans already lack broadband access, and as the Hill notes in an overview of the potential impact of net neutrality’s repeal, “Good broadband is a small town’s lifeline out of geographic isolation, its connection to business software and services, and its conduit for exporting homegrown ideas and products.” Without regulatory inducements, corporate ISPs will have little incentive to develop infrastructure in such areas.  Another group that will be heavily impacted by net neutrality’s repeal — one that’s often overlooked but extremely crucial — is innovators and developers and people who create stuff for the internet. Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the internet as we know it, recently summed up the repeal’s potential effect on these developers:  If US net neutrality rules are repealed, future innovators will have to first negotiate with each ISP to get their new product onto an internet package. That means no more permissionless space for innovation. ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load. In other words, they’ll be able to decide which companies succeed online, which voices are heard  —  and which are silenced.  Again, this all sounds pretty dire — but that’s because it is. The people with the most expertise, the most investment in creating a progressive internet, and the strongest ability to advocate for an open internet could be prevented from doing their best work because of a lack of ability to pay for access to an ISP-controlled space.  It’s important to note, too, that because the nature of the repeal is unprecedented, we can’t necessarily predict every group and demographic that could potentially feel its impact.  5) Why did the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality when it had such overwhelming bipartisan support, and when the effects of a repeal seem so dire?  Pretty much everybody supports net neutrality — it’s one of the few bipartisan issues that most of Congress and most American citizens agree on. The glaring exceptions are the giant ISPs who are reigned in by the regulation.  Over the last nine years, Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T have collectively spent over half a billion dollars lobbying the FCC to end regulatory oversight, and especially to block or repeal net neutrality. They found a loyal friend in Pai, who was appointed to the FCC in 2012 by then President Barack Obama, and named chairman by President Donald Trump shortly after Trump took office  in January. Pai previously worked for Verizon and voted against the 2015 net neutrality ruling as a minority member of the FCC, calling it a “massive intrusion in the internet economy.”  So Pai has basically always supported the repeal of net neutrality , despite the overwhelming public support for it. He believes the 2015 ruling was frivolous and unnecessary , and has also argued, in opposition to hard evidence , that investment in the internet shrinks when net neutrality is in effect. With Trump’s full backing, he has made undoing it a priority.  In fact, even though Pai is legally required to seriously consider the voice of the public when he makes decisions, he has made it clear that he never truly intended to consider most of the millions of comments submitted in support of net neutrality through the FCC’s website since it began the repeal process in May. That’s because the vast majority of those comments were duplicates that came through automated third-party advocacy websites. While many of them were likely submitted by spambots using fake or stolen identities and emails to file comments, many more of them were likely submitted by people using the tried-and-true method of sending a form letter to the government to express their opinions. Pai also rejected the form letters out of hand: Once the number of duplicate comments came to light, the FCC declared that it would be rejecting all duplicated comments as well as “opinions” that came without “introducing new facts.”  Essentially, even though nearly 99 percent of the unique comments that the FCC received were pro-net neutrality and anti-repeal, and even though the entire point of a democratic process is to allow people to express their opinions, the FCC chose to dismiss pretty much every opinion that was expressed, because spambots and auto-duplicated opinions were involved. FCC commissioner Rosenworcel, one of the commission’s two minority Democrats, acknowledged this during the December 14 vote to repeal, noting "the cavalier disregard this agency has demonstrated to the public.”  As Dell Cameron at Gizmodo put it , “To be clear, when the FCC says that it is ‘restoring internet freedom,’ it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers.”  6) What happens now, in the immediate aftermath of the vote?  A flurry of lawsuits from tech companies, internet activists, and think tanks will likely descend upon Washington — starting with a protective filing by internet activists that will appeal the FCC’s vote to prevent the repeal from immediately taking effect.  Mere hours after the FCC vote, the Attorney General of the state of New York announced a multi-state appeal of the ruling , to which a number of other states quickly signed on. The exact number of states participating in the appeal will grow over the coming weeks — technically after a suit is announced, the states (as well as any latecomers to any other lawsuits filed) will have 60 days to join in before the suit closes.  These lawsuits will petition the US Court of Appeals for a review of the FCC’s order. After a filing period of 10 days, all of the lawsuits will eventually be punted collectively to one of the Court of Appeals’ 12 circuit courts, and the ultimate outcome will be largely dependent on which court hears the appeals.  If the repeal does eventually go into effect, the FCC will institute one very thin piece of ISP regulation in place of net neutrality — a version of a 2010 transparency ruling that requires ISPs to inform consumers when the ISPs are deliberately slowing their internet speed. The FCC will be passing off the enforcement of this transparency stipulation to the FTC, in a long-planned and recently formalized agreement that will allow the two commissions “to work together to take targeted action against bad actors.”  7) When will the repeal go into effect?  We simply can’t know at this point. Establishing a workable timeline will depend on a whole heap of factors , such as which circuit court ends up hearing the appeals, whether there is a motion to relocate the appeals to another court, any motions or counter-motions filed on the appeals, and so forth. There’s also the likelihood that net neutrality advocates will ask for stays of the FCC’s ruling so that it can’t take effect while motions are still being heard and appeals are being deliberated.  Additionally, there’s one alternative to the appeals process that’s definitely a longshot, yet still a possibility: Congress could move to pass a joint resolution overturning the repeal and establishing new regulatory oversight. However, given how firmly many Republican politicians have stood behind Pai’s repeal campaign, this seems highly unlikely to happen unless the 2018 midterm elections result in a major upheaval of Congress, and could take years to hash out.  In a nutshell, we don’t know how long will it take to fight the repeal in the court system, so we can’t know when — or if — it will take effect. It’s likely that even if a court overturns the FCC’s decision, that court may only overturn part of it and not the entire thing.  What the final version of a net neutrality repeal might look like, and when it might take effect, are both unknown at this point, with the future of an open internet hanging in the balance.

Jon Brodkin - Nov 22, 2017 9:08 pm UTC         Enlarge  / FCC Chairman Ajit Pai at The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research on May 5, 2017 in Washington, DC. Getty Images | Chip Somodevilla     reader comments  286    Share this story         Net neutrality rules are popular with Americans who use the Internet. When the Federal Communications Commission deliberated on possible net neutrality rules in 2014 and 2015, millions of comments poured in to support strict regulation of Internet service providers.  Public opinion helped push the FCC to adopt rules that prevent ISPs from blocking or throttling Internet content and from charging websites or other online services for priority treatment on the network.  Public opinion hasn't changed much in the two-plus years that the rules have been on the books. The cable lobby surveyed registered voters this year and found that most of them continue to support bans on blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. Multiple polls have found that net neutrality rules are popular with both Democratic and Republican voters . Further Reading RIP net neutrality: FCC chair releases plan to deregulate ISPs  It was thus no surprise to see a huge backlash to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to eliminate the rules. While most of the 22 million public comments on the plan were spam and form letters, a study funded by the broadband industry found that 98.5 percent of unique comments supported the current rules. Net neutrality supporters organized an  "Internet-wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality" in July and plan more protests in the coming days as a final vote draws near.  But net neutrality rules have some vocal and influential opponents. The most prominent are Republican politicians and regulators, conservative think tanks, and the Internet service providers that have to follow the rules. Those are the voices that counted most in Pai's decision to eliminate popular consumer protection regulations.  Pai's full proposal is available here and is expected to be approved in a commission vote on December 14.  FCC official explains why comments can be dismissed  A senior FCC official spoke with reporters about Pai's anti-net neutrality plan in a phone briefing yesterday and explained why the FCC is not swayed by public opinion on net neutrality.  The vast majority of comments consisted of form letters from both pro- and anti-net neutrality groups and generally did not introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments, the official from Pai's office said. In general, the comments stated opinions or made assertions and did not have much bearing on Pai's decision, the official said. The official spoke with reporters on the condition that he not be named and that his comments can be paraphrased but not quoted directly.  The official noted that many of the comments are fraudulent. He said that there were 7.5 million identical comments that came from 45,000 unique names and addresses, apparently due to a scammer who repeatedly submitted the same comment under a series of different names.  The message from this FCC official seemed to be that a huge percentage of the comments can be safely ignored. But the docket is filled with these comments because the FCC took no significant steps to prevent fraud and did not delete even the most obviously fraudulent comments from the record.  Allowing the docket to be filled with junk made it easier for Pai's office to argue that the comments should not be seen as a legitimate expression of public opinion.  Pai's office has also refused to provide evidence for an investigation into fraudulent comments, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said yesterday . Schneiderman said that there was "a massive scheme that fraudulently used real Americans' identities" in order to "drown out the views of real people and businesses."  Pai likes public opinion—when it agrees with him  The FCC isn't required to follow public opinion, but Pai favorably cites public opinion when it suits him.  On net neutrality, Pai and his staff have consistently said that they would consider the quality of the comments rather than the quantity on each side. Yet in another recent decision to eliminate a regulation, Pai took the opposite approach.  "The overwhelming majority of public input favored our proposal," he said before a recent vote, while urging his fellow commissioners to eliminate a decades-old rule that required TV and radio stations to maintain studios in the local communities they serve.  FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, urged the FCC to hold public hearings across the country before eliminating net neutrality rules. Hearings are necessary to get Americans' opinions because of the spam bots, impersonation, and other problems marring the FCC's docket, she argued.  "I've called for public hearings before any change is made to these rules, just as Republican and Democratic commissions have done in the past," Rosenworcel said yesterday . "We should go directly to the American public to find out what they think about this proposal before any vote is taken to harm net neutrality."  Comments that count more than others  The Pai staffer who spoke with reporters acknowledged that there were legitimate comments from both sides in the net neutrality docket. In Pai's draft order, the FCC comprehensively addresses all the serious comments that made factual and legal arguments, the official said.  Pai's order, not surprisingly, speaks favorably of research in the docket that supports his claim that broadband network investment fell as a result of net neutrality rules. The proposal then criticizes studies that found the opposite, saying they used methods that are "unlikely to yield reliable results" or have other problems.  Pai also was not swayed by the fact that ISPs themselves have told investors that the rules do not harm their network investments. That's significant because publicly traded companies are required by law to give investors accurate financial information, including a description of risk factors involved in investing in the company. Further Reading FCC refuses to release text of more than 40,000 net neutrality complaints  Another expression of public opinion comes in the form of complaints filed by consumers against their Internet providers. Yet the FCC initially refused to release the text of tens of thousands of those complaints .  Consumer advocacy groups wanted more time to review those complaints in order to submit analyses into the net neutrality docket. But when the FCC finally released more of them , the big document release came just one day before the deadline for the public to comment on the anti-net neutrality plan.  Pai's proposal says that the tens of thousands of complaints do not prove that the net neutrality rules solve any real problems. "The Commission takes consumer complaints seriously and finds them valuable in informing us about trends in the marketplace, but we reiterate that they are informal complaints that, in most instances, have not been verified," the proposal said.  Like Rosenworcel, Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn says that the opinion of Internet users should be taken more seriously by the commission.  Pai's proposal, she said , "ignores thousands of consumer complaints and millions of individual comments that ask the FCC to save net neutrality and uphold the principles that all traffic should be created equal."    Promoted Comments      shelbystripes  Ars Scholae Palatinae     jump to post    This should make for a nice lawsuit. You can't enact (or repeal) a rule without a genuine public comment period. If they keep being this shockingly dismissive of public comments in general, including an utter lack of attempt to distinguish real and fraudulent comments, they could see this rulemaking overturned. The irony is that the GOP just spent the past decade using courts to aggressively thwart rulemaking. Time to use those precedents against them. This is more blatantly egregious abuse of process than any rulemaking under the Obama administration that was struck down.       4209 posts | registered 6/13/2013                      Jon Brodkin Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.

Jon Brodkin - Dec 11, 2017 9:14 pm UTC         Enlarge  / Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai arrives for his confirmation hearing with the Senate Commerce Committee on July 19, 2017 in Washington, DC. Getty Images | Chip Somodevilla     reader comments  207    Share this story         The Federal Communications Commission is still on track to eliminate net neutrality rules this Thursday, but the commission said today that it has a new plan to protect consumers after the repeal.  The FCC and Federal Trade Commission released a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) describing how the agencies will work together to make sure ISPs keep their net neutrality promises.  After the repeal, there won't be any rules preventing ISPs from blocking or throttling Internet traffic. ISPs will also be allowed to charge websites and online services for faster and more reliable network access. Further Reading Comcast deleted net neutrality pledge the same day FCC announced repeal  In short, ISPs will be free to do whatever they want—unless they make specific promises to avoid engaging in specific types of anti-competitive or anti-consumer behavior. When companies make promises and break them, the FTC can punish them for deceiving consumers. That's what FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Acting FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen are counting on.  “Instead of saddling the Internet with heavy-handed regulations, we will work together to take targeted action against bad actors," Pai said in a joint announcement with the FTC today .  FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat who opposes the net neutrality repeal, is not impressed. She gave this statement to Ars:  The agreement announced today between the FCC and FTC is a confusing, lackluster, reactionary afterthought: an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the Chairman’s draft proposal repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules. Two years ago, the FCC signed a much broader pro-consumer agreement with the FTC that already covers this issue. There is no reason to do this again other than as a smoke-and-mirrors PR stunt, distracting from the FCC’s planned destruction of net neutrality protections later this week.  Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel agreed. FTC enforcement is no substitute for strict rules against blocking, throttling, and discrimination, she said. “Plus, FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact—many months, if not years, after consumers and businesses have been harmed,” she said in a statement to Ars. “This is why the FCC must not relinquish its authority and, more importantly, its responsibility, to the public interest.”  Promises, promises  Pai’s approach essentially lets ISPs pick and choose which net neutrality guidelines, if any, they want to follow.  Most major ISPs are—so far—still promising that they won’t block or throttle lawful Internet content. But net neutrality promises are eroding.  Comcast deleted a “no paid prioritization” pledge from its net neutrality webpage on the very same day that Pai announced his plan to repeal net neutrality rules, as we previously reported .  Ohlhausen confirmed again today that FTC jurisdiction hinges on those ISPs’ promises. This leaves open the possibility that ISPs could change promises related to blocking or throttling.  “The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” Ohlhausen said.  FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat, has said repeatedly that the FTC cannot enforce net neutrality as effectively as the FCC. The FCC has broad rule-making authority and expertise in network engineering that the FTC lacks, McSweeny told Ars in April . Further Reading FCC won’t delay vote, says net neutrality supporters are “desperate”  Moreover, the FTC’s jurisdiction over Internet service providers is uncertain. Pai’s plan would shift authority from the FCC to the FTC by eliminating the common carrier classification of broadband. But a pending court case involving AT&T could end up stripping the FTC of any regulatory authority over ISPs that also operate common-carrier phone networks.  AT&T’s attempt to eliminate FTC authority over any aspect of its business was initially successful when a panel of judges at the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in AT&T’s favor last year. A more recent court decision vacated AT&T’s victory, but a final ruling has not yet been issued. Despite this, Pai decided not to delay the vote on his plan for the FCC to relinquish authority over broadband providers.  “The FTC’s authority in this matter is in question, and an MOU does nothing to answer those concerns,” Rosenworcel said today.  ISPs’ public disclosures  Pai’s plan does require ISPs to make public disclosures of blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, prioritization of ISPs' own content, congestion management practices, and limitations imposed on specific types of applications or devices.  The FCC/FTC agreement relies partially on those disclosures. This is how the FCC and FTC describe the major parts of their collaboration:    The FCC will review informal complaints concerning the compliance of Internet service providers (ISPs) with the disclosure obligations set forth in the new transparency rule. Those obligations include publicly providing information concerning an ISP’s practices with respect to blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and congestion management. Should an ISP fail to make the required disclosures—either in whole or in part—the FCC will take enforcement action.  The FTC will investigate and take enforcement action as appropriate against ISPs concerning the accuracy of those disclosures, as well as other deceptive or unfair acts or practices involving their broadband services.  The FCC and the FTC will broadly share legal and technical expertise, including the secure sharing of informal complaints regarding the subject matter of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. The two agencies also will collaborate on consumer and industry outreach and education.    Consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge said that the FCC/FTC plan will not protect consumers from ISPs.  “Not only is the FCC eliminating basic net neutrality rules, but it’s joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public,” Public Knowledge VP Chris Lewis said . “This gives free rein to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you of it.”    Promoted Comments      trimeta  Ars Scholae Palatinae     jump to post    And what exactly will make the ISPs promise anything?

Imagine if everyone has 5+ broadband providers to choose from, then the whole net neutrality problem wouldn't even be an issue. In fact, some people might even opt into non net neutrality to save some money. If the FCC really thinks the problem would solve itself, they need to nationalize all broadband pipeline and make the ISP service providers only. Only once you decouple the content provider from the infrastructure operator could you solve this problem.       1083 posts | registered 8/24/2012        LuDux  Ars Scholae Palatinae     jump to post    Does he realize he just admitted that net neutrality protects consumers?       1338 posts | registered 7/1/2012                      Jon Brodkin Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.

When you call them up, make the point that if net neutrality laws weren't in place during that election, the ISP could have given preferential bandwidth to their opponent, because why should they dedicate their resources to a candidate they don't support?  Make it clear that this affects them arguably more than it does the average voter.  Under the current proposed changes they can do this, as long as they report what they're doing just like they have to report financial support to candidates (I think).  This will become a step above our current problems with campaign financing, ISPs and the corporations which own them will be able to change the results of elections in their favor by controlling the flow of information.  If this isn't an existential crisis to our democracy then I don't know what is.

It seems like breaking the internet up into packages would hinder websites from reaching out to more people (customers). I hear a lot of people saying that they don't WANT to pay for several different packages, but I am in the situation where I CAN'T afford different packages.  "I don't have enough money to purchase the social media package anymore. I'm quitting Facebook and Twitter."  "It would be cheaper for me to buy things from the mall than to pay for the shopping package to use Amazon."  Just speaking personally, I am not reliant on the internet for much of anything. I'm in my 30s and know how it felt living before the internet. If Net Neutrality is killed and package deals become real, my internet usage would be a barely minimal. Internet shopping would lose my business, streaming music would lose my business, social media would lose my business. Many things that I can use now with my relativity cheap all-included internet would become impossible to afford if they are split up into packages.  Am I in the minority in this? Do people really have the money to purchase all of these deals? Internet companies are going to lose business if the net is split up.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (5 replies) [–] Drugfreedave  73 points 74 points 75 points  4 months ago  (37 children) Ok, so let's say the worst happens. What happens then? Will people clamor to switch ISP's if available that don't throttle, or don't charge more for certain sites/usage?  - I'll admit I'm not 100% on what net neutrality means. It seems to mean that ISP's will just have more control over different usages of the internet. I've heard they'll charge more for "documentaries" or for Netflix; if this happens, I have to assume Netflix will have a drop off in users. Or the specific ISP's who will charge more for Netflix or cause  the experience to be hindered those people will leave causing Netflix and that ISP to lose money. In the case of affecting reddit let's say, I use sync for mobile so would it be my ISP that would affect me using it? Would reddit figure out some alternative or workaround so people can continue the same experience? Sort of like internet calling and texting overseas, which is widely available and free, but was once a premium to be paid for.
Also, let's say someone calls their representatives and a representative answers, what would be the best thing to say? I feel like simply "save net neutrality" wouldn't be sufficient if they ask "why should we save it". I'm the type that prefers to know my business before making a call/claim, and this net neutrality business seems so confusing. I'm all for it... fuck spending more money, or being throttled, just want some more insight from you smarties on the topic.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] bryanrobh  72 points 73 points 74 points  4 months ago  (23 children) The worst that could happen is these isps can charge whatever they want for whatever plan they want.

The amount of wiring and cabling that it takes to integrate an ISP into an area is massive, and even with huge funding, existing ISP's will fight tooth and nail to maintain monopolies. Look at Google Fiber. Google, for God's sakes, has had massive issues trying to get their internet service to people, imagine being a startup trying to do what google can't...   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] icykronik  6 points 7 points 8 points  4 months ago  (3 children) Exactly. They faced lawsuits from other companies for trying to use the existing infrastructure. The whole idea of Google Fiber was to show that increased competition forced the isps to offer higher tiered, faster plans, using their existing infrastructure. Imagine being a startup with the money that Google has, not having to fight against the government and their nonsense rules....   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] SlippedOnAnIcecube  12 points 13 points 14 points  4 months ago  (0 children) This isn't coherent, repealing net neutrality isn't going to do anything about getting rid of existing laws on the books that will help new ISP's compete with the big ones, please look into what NN entails.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] watisgoinon_  4 points 5 points 6 points  4 months ago  (0 children) It's pretty clear you have no idea what net neutrality is.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] forcrowsafeast  3 points 4 points 5 points  4 months ago  (0 children) Those are local rules the companies bought politicians to legislate that have zero to do with net neutrality...   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–] forcrowsafeast  5 points 6 points 7 points  4 months ago  (0 children) Net neutrality has nothing to do with the infrastructure or last mile hegemony problem caused by local oligopolies.

You know those shit cell phone companies run on the same towers as the major companies, right? They provide the same service, creating more competition, causing everyone to have to lower their prices. Wouldn't it be nice if multiple companies had access to the fiber optic cables that the ISP's were already paid by our government to lay down?   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] bryanrobh  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 months ago  (2 children) Yeah but if you go through the shit cell companies it’s bad service. Who would want bad internet service. The only way I want another isp is if they are providing equal or better service to the big names   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] icykronik  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 months ago  (1 child) It's not shit cell service though. Maybe it was 10 years ago...but they use the existing networks the "shit" cell companies don't put up towers. They use AT&T or Sprints towers. The idea is that someone like google fiber steps in with actual good service and forces others to up their game. Keeping things the same will only lead to data caps and anything else the only ISP you can buy from can get away with.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] bryanrobh  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 months ago  (0 children) I mean you compare cricket with Verizon and there is no comparison even though it uses the same towers.

In the case of removing Net Neutrality, these ISPs not have full control over what availability to sites and services you have and you are unable to switch to a different provider.  Taking your Sync for Mobile (Reddit) example, an ISP could change you more for access to Reddit on your data plan or take money from a Reddit competitor (we'll say 9gag for laughs) and create a 'fast pipe' for them (9gag gets normal speeds, Reddit speeds get throttled and slowed).  Here is a very quick explanation by CGP Grey on the topic  Here's a more thorough video by The Verge (has some rough language)  Feel free to ask me any questions. I work with Networks for a living and know a lot about the topic.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Drugfreedave  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 months ago  (0 children) Thanks for the info! It's much less confusing after checking out the videos, much appreciated.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] srpokemon  8 points 9 points 10 points  4 months ago  (0 children) Essentially ISP could charge more for specific sites and block access to smaller sites altogether/throttle them so much they are essentially inaccessible (causing them to die off).   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] TheLoneScot  4 points 5 points 6 points  4 months ago  (8 children) Switch ISP's?

I have Fios internet. No cable. So you're saying two would die off? Or they would merge?

That would suck. Ok so let's say the worst happens, and they start charging you more for specific access to let's say youtube or Netflix. I feel like alternatives would pop up, be immensely successful without those specific rate changes or throttles and both YouTube and Netflix would lose out in those areas. It just doesn't seem like a smart business move for business?? Just so we're clear I don't want this to happen, but I feel like something has got to give if they keep stealing more and more of people's money like this.  Edit: alternatives like newpipe for youtube, or Hulu / Amazon for Netflix.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] B3nny_Th3_L3nny  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 months ago  (1 child) well if they throttle it ie charge for fast lane acess the alternative would be like trying to watch game of thrones but every other second the video buffers kind of thing   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (1 reply) [–] TheLoneScot  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 months ago  (1 child) I live in San Diego, and in my area of town, for lowest tier (<20 Mbps) I can choose Cox or AT&T.  If I want any faster speeds, I get to "choose" Cox.  Between my options, and yours in NYC, it highlights my point - neither one of our cities is small.  Why is our selection for ISPs so small?  I'm not saying that two would die off.  I envision a potential future where (just for ease) say that Fios adopts a conservative and/or right wing stance, TW adopts a liberal and/or left wing stance, and RCN takes on the rest.  If you are someone who likes to collect viewpoints from across multiple political spectrums.  Well, if you're a Fios customer, they decide to throttle or completely eliminate access to other media and viewpoints.  Fine, switch to another ISP.  Well, now you only get their content.  Regarding new services or services like your Newpipe or Hulu/Amazon examples - what happens when your ISP blocks those services?  I've never heard of Newpipe before, but it looks like it is only for Android (please correct me if I'm wrong).  How does that become a viable solution for a PC user?  Or if ISPs do allow access to perhaps some, but not all of these new services, do you really want to be paying a separate fee for each service?  My fear - I hold no reservations about how nefarious these companies are.  Imagine how difficult it may be in the future to get information about how to resist against these companies, or organize protests or other movements.  If this move against NN passes, how long until your mobile carrier gets to do the same?  I hope my tone comes across okay with this post.  All I want to do is highlight the current, real world situation for many internet consumers.  I can only see it getting much worse if Net Neutrality is repealed, and hope I can convey the seriousness of the situation to you.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Drugfreedave  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 months ago  (0 children) Well I for one appreciate the responses, it just helps me wrap my head around this whole thing, rather than just taking a position because everyone else is convinced.

And it gave us an Internet economy that became the envy of the world."  “But in 2015, the prior FCC bowed to pressure from President Obama. On a party-line vote, it imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulations upon the Internet. That decision was a mistake. It’s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation."  “Today, I have shared with my colleagues a draft order that would abandon this failed approach and return to the longstanding consensus that served consumers well for decades. Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet. Instead, the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate."  “Additionally, as a result of my proposal, the Federal Trade Commission will once again be able to police ISPs, protect consumers, and promote competition, just as it did before 2015.

I read a lot on here that the effect would be that you'd end up paying extra for 'packages' or certain sites. The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.
However there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!
It sounds great but;
1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!
2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.
3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.  Net neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.  So yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers. So beware and make sure every not-tech-savvy person is informed on the risk!   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] pepperonihotdog  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 months ago  (0 children) Wouldn't this make the internet a utility like electric or gas or water?   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] UnluckyIdiot  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 months ago  (0 children) The scariest part is that without Net Neutrality, THIS would never be happening.

If not enough people are doing that to make a difference, then perhaps the behavioral issue is with you, not the company.

At long last, with the end of “net neutrality,” competition could soon come to the industry that delivers Internet services to you   Right out of the gate this is already absurd. Why does allowing ISPs to discriminate between data passing through their network mean that they are now magically able to compete with each other? ISPs already can compete with each other, they simply choose not to in many cases as it is more profitable not to do so.  The only way this argument makes sense is if you are arguing that by giving them more power to screw the customer, the ones that screw the customer the least will be more successful. This is an idiotic plan, as they will obviously just drop down to a roughly similar level to each other, which will still leave little actual competition while also doing nothing but dropping the quality of the service they provide.   With market-based pricing finally permitted, we could see new entrants to the industry because it might make economic sense for the first time to innovate. The growing competition will lead, over the long run, to innovation and falling prices.   No, we won't. It will not suddenly cost less to lay fiber and develop infrastructure, and any larger ISP that services an area will just choke out anyone that tries to break into the market. Or they will just do the same thing that has led to the current situation and just buy a bunch of politicians to pass laws to prevent competition.   The old rules pushed by the Obama administration had locked down the industry with regulation that only helped incumbent service providers and major content delivery services.  It created an Internet communication cartel not unlike the way the banking system works under the Federal Reserve.   Wow, this is so wrong it would be funny if they weren't serious. How in the world does Title 2 classification create a cartel? How does preventing ISPs from abusing their position and demanding protection money from websites cement their power?   Net Neutrality had the backing of all the top names in content delivery, from Google to Yahoo to Netflix to Amazon. It’s had the quiet support of the leading Internet service providers Comcast and Verizon.   The silent support of Comcast and Verizon? Do you realize that Verizon is the reason ISPs are classified as Title 2? ISPs WERE Title 1, the FCC attempted to prevent them from secretly throttling content and blocking access to sites, Verizon sued the FCC, the FCC classified ISPs as Title 2 in order to be able to enforce these rules. Verizon does NOT support Net Neutrality in theory or in practice, and they have repeatedly done everything they can to fight it.   The imposition of a rule against throttling content or using the market price system to allocate bandwidth resources protects against innovations that would disrupt the status quo.   Good lord I'm so tired of hearing arguments like this. Here, try this one:  "Passing a law to prevent store owners from killing each other's customers to drive each other out of business protects against innovations that would disrupt the status quo."  Maybe some things are the status quo for a good reason, and shouldn't be "disrupted with innovations"?   Netflix, Amazon, and the rest don’t want ISPs to charge either them or their consumers for their high-bandwidth content. They would rather the ISPs themselves absorb the higher costs of such provision.   That's not how this works. The customers already pay for the service from the ISP. Netflix, Amazon, and the rest already pay for the service from the ISP. Net Neutrality prevents the ISP from turning around and saying, "Hey, Netflix, nice streaming service you've got there. It'd be a shame if people suddenly couldn't reach it. You'd better pay me a load of extra money just to make sure that doesn't happen."   By analogy, let’s imagine that a retailer furniture company were in a position to offload all their shipping costs to the trucking industry. By government decree, the truckers were not permitted to charge any more or less whether they were shipping one chair or a whole houseful of furniture. Would the furniture sellers favor such a deal? Absolutely. They could call this “furniture neutrality” and fob it off on the public as preventing control of furniture by the shipping industry.   Again, that's not how this works. The author clearly does not understand this topic.  Netflix already pays for the amount of bandwidth they use. In this analogy, they pay for the amount of trucks it takes to ship their furniture. Net Neutrality prevents the trucking company from opening up the truck, seeing that they are shipping furniture that wasn't made by their cousin Bill, and charging extra because of it.   But that leaves the question about why the opposition from the ISPs themselves (the truckers by analogy) would either be silent or quietly in favor of such a rule change.   What? The author just got done saying how "furniture neutrality" would be a deal in favor of the furniture sellers, why would the truckers be in favor of it?   If you are a dominant player in the market — an incumbent firm like Comcast and Verizon — you really face two threats to your business model. You have to keep your existing consumer base onboard and you have to protect against upstarts seeking to poach consumers from you.   1) No you don't, you run regional monopolies that leave little to no risk of losing customers because they are frequently choosing between your service or nothing at all.  2) Not really, because as mentioned before the barrier to entry for this industry are very high and the incumbent firms have politicians in their pockets to insure that nobody messes with their monopolies.   For established firms, a rule like net neutrality can raise the costs of doing business,   No it can't, it just limits your potential profits by preventing you from abusing your customers.   You are in a much better position to absorb higher costs than those barking at your heels. This means that you can slow down development, cool it on your investments in fiber optics, and generally rest on your laurels more.   That's exactly what they are doing right now, and it is exactly what they will be doing if Title II regulations are repealed, but they will just be making more money while doing so.   But how can you sell such a nefarious plan? You get in good with the regulators. You support the idea in general, with some reservations, while tweaking the legislation in your favor. You know full well that this raises the costs to new competitors. When it passes, call it a vote for the “open internet” that will “preserve the right to communicate freely online.”   Is the author really trying to push a "stick it to the man, fight Net Neutrality!" angle by claiming that companies like Verizon don't want it to be repealed? Again, it would be hilarious if it wasn't so serious.   But when you look closely at the effects, the reality was exactly the opposite. Net neutrality closed down market competition by generally putting government and its corporate backers in charge of deciding who can and cannot play in the market. It erected barriers to entry for upstart firms while hugely subsidizing the largest and most well-heeled content providers.   No it didn't, no it didn't, and no it didn't.   So what are the costs to the rest of us? It meant no price reductions in internet service. It could mean the opposite. Your bills went up and there was very little competition. It also meant a slowing down in the pace of technological development due to the reduction in competition that followed the imposition of this rule. In other words, it was like all government regulation: most of the costs were unseen, and the benefits were concentrated in the hands of the ruling class.   Again, Net Neutrality had absolutely nothing to do with rising costs of internet service, ISPs did not lose money, they just lost the ability to squeeze more money out of their customers.  It did not slow down technological development. With Title II, any competition has to be forward moving, ISPs actually have to offer better service than their competitors if they are actually in an area where there are any. Without Title II, competition suddenly becomes regressive, which company is fucking over their customers the least?  All government regulation only benefits the ruling class? Good fucking lord man, did you read the article you posted? Does reducing lead in the water supply only benefit the ruling class? Does preventing McDonalds from mashing up dead rats they find in the store into chicken nuggets only benefit the ruling class?   The simultaneous, contradictory, and economically absurd attempt by the Justice Department to stop the merger of Time-/Warner and AT&T–which might only be a government attempt to punish CNN and therefore an abuse of presidential power–is another matter for another time.   Please take a second to think about this. The author of this piece just spent all of this time making all of these ridiculous arguments and ranting about how bad giant companies are, then turns around to claim that stopping Time-Warner and AT&T from merging is "economically absurd".  I had to delete multiple paragraphs from my response as there simply isn't enough room to address all of the misinformation in this article in a single Reddit comment. This author is an idiot, and it reflects very poorly on you that you are parroting this bullshit.  I highly recommend that you do some real research on the topic and try to think more critically in the future so that you may avoid embarrassing yourself like this again.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–] ViZeShadowZ  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 months ago  (0 children) the odds are really fucking high if not enough people do something about it   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] MunkeeDestroyer  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 months ago  (0 children) I've already told them to #gofccyourself on Twitter and on the petition's.

Here’s What to Expect                                                By John Patrick Pullen  December 13, 2017       The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) net neutrality vote is scheduled for Thursday, December 14, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, and has the potential to radically alter the internet as we know it.  The Commissioner of the FCC, Ajit Pai, appointed to his post by President Donald Trump, has proposed reclassifying internet providers from utilities to information companies, and the rest of the commission is due to vote on it Thursday. If the vote goes along party lines, net neutrality will be repealed and internet providers will be able to legally control the speed of content running through their network, a practice that is currently prohibited. But for many reasons, the net neutrality vote is a controversial one.  Here’s everything you need to know:      What is net neutrality?  If Thursday’s net neutrality vote is giving you déjà vu, you’re not alone. Net neutrality regulations were originally put in place just two years ago in February 2015, when the Obama-era FCC voted to regulate Internet companies like they were a utility. “There are no toll roads on the information superhighway,” President Barack Obama said when he called for a net neutrality vote in 2014.  Under the Obama-era net neutrality guidelines, broadband providers were classified as Title II or “common carriers,” which meant they couldn’t discriminate in the traffic that flowed through their traffic. But Pai prefers less regulation, and believes that if the companies are subject to fewer restrictions, they’ll invest in more technologies to push the internet forward.  This is more than just difference of philosophies. Net neutrality impacts everything from how fast movies are streamed on Netflix to how much companies will charge for online services.    When is the net neutrality vote?  The net neutrality vote on Thursday comes after months of public commentary and consideration over whether to maintain or rollback the regulations approved by the FCC during 2015. If approved, broadband internet companies will be recategorized as a Title I information services instead of Title II common carriers. This would allow the companies to throttle traffic from websites and allow other sites to move faster through paid prioritization.  Who is voting on net neutrality?  FCC Commissioner Pai leads a 3-2 Republican majority commission staffed by other, less notable (but not less influential) commissioners. A former general counsel for Verizon , the Obama-appointed Republican has drawn public ire for being a telecommunications industry “puppet,” something that he even joked about at a recent event. Pai has long been outspoken on his disagreement with the principles of net neutrality, well before Trump tapped him to chair the FCC.          President Obama's @FTC Chairman: after @FCC repeal of Internet regulations, "the sky isn’t falling. Consumers will remain protected, and the internet will continue to thrive." https://t.co/Nn3muFXnZC  — Ajit Pai (@AjitPaiFCC) December 13, 2017     Likely to vote to uphold net neutrality, Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn was also appointed by President Obama and is described by the FCC as “a longtime champion of consumers and a defender of the public interest.” Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel will also likely vote in favor of retaining net neutrality. The Democratic appointee has worked in communications law both privately and for the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.      Republican appointee Michael O’Rielly has been with the FCC since 2013, and is likely to vote against net neutrality. O’Rielly has a resume filled with legal jobs with Congress, both in representative and committee offices. The newest commissioner to the FCC, Brendan Carr, was nominated by Trump in August, and is expected to vote against net neutrality as well. Carr is not unfamiliar with the FCC — he previously served as the commission’s general counsel.  What is the net neutrality debate?  The substantive issues of the net neutrality debate ahead of tomorrow’s vote are more important than the sideshow that has popped up around them. But that said, #netneutrality, as a movement, has generated a fair deal of headlines.  Most seriously is the issue of whether the FCC’s commenting system has been compromised, and if so, by whom. According to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, 2 million comments submitted to the FCC were fake and used the stolen identities of real Americans . That’s an alarming problem, and one that Schneiderman says the FCC did nothing to investigate.      Stuffing the comment box was John Oliver’s net neutrality strategy of choice, something the host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight suggested through his “Go FCC Yourself” campaign. An ardent opponent of the Trump administration, Oliver launched a net neutrality protest campaign that was so successful, it even crashed the FCC’s website. (In response, the FCC has said the site was crashed by a cyber attack, and considering the two million fake messages, may very well be true — and reason for investigation.)  Many are wondering, does President Trump support net neutrality? With his penchant for hands-off regulations, it’s easy to assume that he doesn’t. Other than putting his support in Pai, Trump hasn’t weighed in on the topic in a long time — possibly since since 2014.          Obama’s attack  on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014     Interestingly enough, Twitter — which Trump loves — hates the idea of repealing net neutrality.          We, at Twitter, believe that #NetNeutrality is key to free expression, innovation & public safety. Tomorrow is a critical day for preserving these protections. https://t.co/8jknvlWN8T  — Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) December 13, 2017     Where can you watch the FCC net neutrality vote live?  With the future of streaming video at stake, it only makes sense that the FCC would live-stream the net neutrality vote. Follow along on the FCC’s website starting at 10:30 a.m.      What comes after the net neutrality vote?  In the unlikely event that the net neutrality vote preserves the regulations, nothing changes. But what’s more likely is that the rule change will pass on party-line voting 3-2 in favor of a net neutrality repeal. There’s always the possibility that a net neutrality bill would codify the protections into law, but that would involve a highly partisan Congress working together. It could happen — after all, Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of the FCC keeping net neutrality — but don’t hold your breath.  Instead, we’re more likely to see lawsuits as the next course of action in the net neutrality protest. According to Reuters, at least four groups — Common Cause, Free Press, the Internet Association, and Public Knowledge — have lawyers at the ready, weighing their legal options. And then it would be déjà vu all over again. In 2016, internet broadband providers sued the FCC over net neutrality protections — and lost.

The Republican-controlled FCC approved the proposal to repeal with a 3-2 vote along party lines, dismantling the Obama-era policy that requires internet providers to treat all web traffic equally.  FCC chief Ajit Pai, who previously worked for Verizon Communications before President Donald Trump appointed him to his role in January, proposed the change on Nov. 21 . “Today, I’m proposing to repeal the heavy-handed Internet regulations imposed by the Obama Administration and to return to the light-touch framework under which the Internet developed and thrived before 2015,” Pai wrote on Twitter the day of the announcement . (Trump reconfirmed Pai for a five year term in October.)  Ahead of the net neutrality vote Thursday, the FCC invited public comments on the upcoming vote and 23 million were submitted, though many of them came from bots or were submitted using other people’s names without their consent.      Net neutrality advocates protested outside the FCC vote and say they are prepared to sue in order to continue fighting the repeal. A poll from the University of Maryland showed that 83% of Americans do not approve of the FCC repealing net neutrality.  In Congress, the repeal has opponents from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) who sits on a subcommittee that oversees the FCC said on Tuesday that he plans to introduce legislation after the vote that would block the repeal from going into effect. Several Republicans voiced support for net neutrality and called for a bipartisan legislative solution to the issue rather than leaving the decision up to the FCC.  But what does net neutrality mean and how will it affect your Internet use if regulations are reversed? Here’s what you need to know right now.    What is net neutrality?  This term has been kicking around for several years, but most people struggle to define it.  When net neutrality is enforced, as it is right now, all internet service providers must allow equal access to apps and content, regardless of the source. If it were not enforced, your internet service provider could make it harder for you to access parts of the internet at its own discretion.  For a while it was a running joke that people knew net neutrality was important, but struggled to describe it. Back in 2015 (in the era of the dress debate ), Saturday Night Live did a sketch that hinged on none of the invited guests — all people who made a living on the web — understanding how these net neutrality policies would work.      John Oliver broke it down in 2014 on his show Last Week Tonight and again in May of this year , when the FCC announced that it would be accepting comments on the new net neutrality rules.  “’The Internet is the repository of all human knowledge — and goats singing Taylor Swift songs,’ said John Oliver on Last Week Tonight, rejoicing in the fact that the Internet is an incredible place,” wrote Time reporter Melissa Locker when the below clip first aired. “However, according to Oliver, that is threatened by the Trump administration’s decision to roll back protections for net neutrality.”           What will the internet look like without net neutrality?  Without the assurance of net neutrality, large internet companies could favor their own business interests. Telecom giants and Silicon Valley titans are likely to lobby lawmakers in the coming days and weeks, but for now, net neutrality could affect everything from internet speed to overall access.  Slower speeds  The elimination of net neutrality means that internet providers can carve up service into fast and slow lanes, charging more for higher speeds. Comcast could demand fees from Netflix , for example, in exchange for preferential treatment. (In response to the FCC plan, Netflix took to Twitter to show “strong support” for net neutrality.)  If content companies don’t want to pay, internet service providers could make them so slow that they’re unwatchable or even block access to competitors’ sites.          The FCC is getting ready to overturn #NetNeutrality . If they succeed, ISPs will be able to split the net into packages. This means that you will no longer be able to pay one price to access any site you want. pic.twitter.com/vEkNxPmVlu  — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) November 21, 2017     Higher prices  Reversing net neutrality rules could cost more to binge your favorite shows on Netflix or Hulu, to play video games , send messages on social media, or even to watch porn. These fees will likely be absorbed by consumers. So those with wallets fat enough for the price hike will enjoy higher speeds, but lower income browsers will get only a limited view of what was once a more open and egalitarian web.      More choices (maybe)  The argument for eliminating net neutrality posits that less regulation will lead to more investment and more competition in the internet service provider sector. FCC Chairman Pai said in May that this could benefit consumers and increase the number of Americans with internet access.  The lack of competition in certain areas of the country means that greater choice for customers would be hard to achieve and the biggest beneficiaries of eliminating net neutrality will be the largest internet service providers .  This change would likely result in paying for bundles or packages to access to different parts of the web, including social media sites like Twitter and Facebook , a model similar to the one that has worked out so well for cable .      Defending his proposal to repeal net neutrality in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Monday, Pai criticized web platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter for controlling what users see online, suggesting they restrict free expression.  “One of the things that people have suggested is it’s not Internet service providers, it’s some of the content companies that decide what you see on the Internet and, more importantly, what you don’t see. Where’s the transparency there? Shouldn’t we have a conversation that involves them, as well?” he said.  Which countries do not have net neutrality?  What’s happening in the U.S. isn’t without precedent.  In Portugal, there are no net neutrality rules and internet packages, like what’s described above, already exist. The other countries without net neutrality enforcement include Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, and Slovenia.

Explore Follow Innovation Net Neutrality share this Net Neutrality Decision Could be Stuck in the Courts for Years It won't go away overnight. By Alasdair Wilkins on November 28, 2017 Filed Under Politics Net neutrality is on life support at the FCC, and in two weeks, it’s expected that the Republican-controlled commission will vote to remove the consumer protections. The proposal circulated before Thanksgiving to end net neutrality goes to a vote when the FCC meets on December 14, with the vote expected to go 3-2 along party lines to approval his new rules. After years of debate, uncertainty, and reversals, that vote in two weeks means the end of net neutrality’s story at the FCC. But that doesn’t mean telecommunications companies like Comcast and AT&T will immediately be able to roll out tiered internet plans and start throttling site speeds. In all likelihood, the next stop for net neutrality will be the courts — and Pai figures to face an uphill battle to get judges to agree with his new rules.telecommunications companies like Comcast and AT&T will immediately be able to roll out tiered internet plans and start throttling site speeds. In all likelihood, the next stop for net neutrality will be the courts — and Pai figures to face an uphill battle to get judges to agree with his new rules. There’s a very simple reason for that: Federal agencies like the FCC can’t change existing rules just because they want to. The fact that a Trump appointee like Pai disagrees philosophically with the Obama-era FCC’s position on net neutrality isn’t in and of itself justification to change the rules. Pai and the FCC have to make a fact-based argument to do away with net neutrality. If they can’t do that, even a court full of Republican judicial appointees would be compelled to strike down the FCC’s decision and preserve net neutrality. Article continues below The revolution will not be televised. It'll be sent to your inbox by us. Sign up for our newsletter: sign up You can find Pai’s rationale right at the top of the text he circulated ahead of the December 14 meeting: “In 2015, the Commission imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulation on Internet service providers (ISPs),” he writes. “Since then, broadband investment has fallen for two years in a row — the first time that that’s happened outside a recession in the Internet era. And new services have been delayed or scuttled by a regulatory environment that stifles innovation.” Those are Pai’s key facts. Never mind any of the facts that weight against that — like the overwhelming public support for net neutrality or the fact that ISPs don’t actually create almost any of the content they send, which makes the FCC’s 2015 reclassification of telecoms from “information providers” to “common carriers” seem pretty intuitive. Those don’t even need to matter. If Pai’s own stated facts aren’t supportable, then there’s no legal basis for the end of net neutrality. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Pai has been making his arguments about reduced investment and innovation for a while now, and outside observers have repeatedly countered that his numbers don’t add up. No, seriously, a report this May from the Free Press Action Network was literally titled “Sorry, Chairman Pai: Your Investment Numbers Don’t Add Up.” By any metric — and the report stresses Pai’s preferred metric of total industry investment is actually one of the least precise ways to judge this, but even by that metric — spending has gone up since the 2015 decision. “Altogether, publicly traded ISPs spent approximately 5 percent more on capital investment during the two years after the FCC’s decision than they did in the two years prior. Far from declining or flatlining, aggregate industry investment has been growing,” the report finds. “Total capital spending across the three survey categories of broadband providers was $87.184 billion — more than $553 million higher than it was in 2014.” Is that simple refutation of Pai’s argument the entire ballgame? Maybe not. The FCC has its own figures — which net neutrality advocates have persuasively argued are disingenuous — and it will have lawyers to defend the validity of those numbers in court. The legal battle would likely prove protracted. Lasting clear until, say, January 2021, when it’s possible there will be a new president and, with that, a new FCC chairman. We run into this kind of story most often with the Environmental Protection Agency. Any new rule the agency puts forth — whether more pro-environment in the case of Democratic administrations, or more pro-industry in the case of Republican ones — faces months or even years of legal challenges from anyone with a stake. And in the case of net neutrality and FCC, everyone who uses the internet, plus giant companies like Amazon and Google that have every reason to stand against Pai’s proposal, would have a stake in keeping net neutrality tied up in the courts for as along as possible. The FCC figures to make net neutrality that much more vulnerable after its expected vote on December 14. That’s the end of the battle. It’s likely just the beginning of the war.

Eric Thayer/Getty Images It's official: the country's top regulator of the internet wants to end net neutrality. Specifically, Federal Communications Commission chair Ajit Pai plans to repeal changes that gave the agency the authority to enforce net neutrality protections—that is, rules requiring internet service providers to treat all internet traffic equally. But he won't likely be able to do so without a big legal fight. During a speech today in Washington, Pai announced his intention to undo one of the Obama-era FCC's signature achievements. Although he was light on specifics (he plans to release the full text of his proposal tomorrow), Pai made clear that he would seek to reverse an FCC decision to classify broadband internet access providers as "Title II" common carriers, putting them in the same category as traditional telephone companies. The re-classification gave the FCC authority to impose net neutrality requirements on both wireless and home broadband providers, preventing them from, for example, charging specific sites or companies fees for sending traffic over their networks or slowing down competitors' streaming video offerings.

"Going forward, we cannot stick with regulations from the Great Depression meant to micromanage Ma Bell," Pai said. The FCC will vote on—and given its Republican majority, likely pass—the proposal during an open meeting May 18. But that will only start what promises to be a lengthy battle for the future of net neutrality. To truly torpedo the requirements, Pai will have to make the case that he's doing so for good reason. A 1946 law called the Administrative Procedure Act bans federal agencies making "capricious" decisions. The law is meant, in part, to keep regulations from yo-yoing back and forth every time a new party gained control of the White House. The FCC successfully argued in favor of Title II reclassification in federal court just last summer . That effort means Pai might have to make the case that things had changed enough since then to justify a complete reversal in policy. "That's a pretty dramatic reversal," says Marc Martin, chair of communications law at Perkins Coie. "Presuming there's an appeal, a court may find that arbitrary." Staying Neutral Based both on his speech today and previous remarks , it appears that Pai will make the case that Title II reclassification led to a substantial decline in broadband infrastructure investment. Pai says that internet providers large and small are spending less money upgrading their networks and expanding into new markets because of the supposed regulatory burden. "Just this week, 22 small ISPs, each of which has about 1,000 broadband customers or fewer, told the FCC that the Title II order had affected their ability to obtain financing," Pai said. "They said it had slowed, if not halted, the development and deployment of innovative new offerings which would benefit our customers." Indeed, the industry group US Telecom estimates that broadband investment dipped from about $77 billion in 2014 to $76 billion in 2015. But those numbers are in dispute. During a hearing earlier this year, senator Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts) pointed to US Census Bureau estimates that broadband investment increased slightly from $86.6 in 2014 to $87.2 billion in 2015. (Neither organization has published investment data on 2016 yet.) 'We cannot stick with regulations from the Great Depression meant to micromanage Ma Bell.' FCC Chair Ajit Pai In either case, the difference doesn't amount to a significant change, presenting Pai with what would seem to be a challenge in arguing Title II reclassification was the real reason for a purported drop. Other business considerations could also play into changes in telecom spending on network infrastructure, such as a desire to wait and let previous investments pay for themselves before making new ones. The CEO of Verizon , for example, told shareholders that Title II didn't affect the company's investment plans. And Martin points out that a recent auction in which companies spent $19.8 billion to buy rights to use more of the wireless spectrum doesn't exactly look like an industry shy of investing. If the infrastructure argument doesn't fly, Pai could also argue that the rules are unnecessary because proverbial fast and slow lanes for the internet never existed. The problem is that's not true. The Bush-era FCC ordered Comcast to stop throttling BitTorrent traffic in 2008, for one. But that's not all. Under a secret agreement with AT&T, Apple blocked iPhone users from making Skype calls over the carrier's network until the FCC pressured the companies into reversing the policy in 2009. And in 2012, AT&T blocked some users from using Apple's Face Time on its network. Had Comcast, and later Verizon, not argued in court that the FCC had no authority to stop them from blocking and throttling content, then the agency might never have needed to pass Title II reclassification in the first place. Even if Pai's attempts to undo Title II classification fail, Congress could undo the agency's authority to enforce net neutrality regulations. Senate Democrats can't do much about Pai's proposal, but they are already vowing a "tsunami of resistance" if their colleagues across the aisle try to act. It's not clear whether that promised tidal wave includes a filibuster. Either way, whether in the courts or the legislature, the fight to save net neutrality is far from over. #FCC #Net Neutrality Most Popular gear 4 Best Smartphones of 2018: Guide to Android, Samsung Galaxy, iPhone Author: Jeffrey Van Camp Jeffrey Van Camp gear How to Check If Cambridge Analytica Could Access Your Facebook Data Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett transportation Porsche's 919 Hybrid Evo Wallops F1's Fastest Cars Author: Jack Stewart Jack Stewart More Stories View Comments Sponsored Stories Powered By Outbrain Issie Lapowsky Facebook Exposed 87 Million Users to Cambridge Analytica Louise Matsakis Police Say YouTube Policies Motivated Shooter Louise Matsakis The Cryptocurrency Industry Might Actually Benefit From an Ad Ban Erin Griffith Spotify and the Triumph of the Subscription Model Issie Lapowsky YouTube Shooting Spree Injures 4, Kills 1 More business social media Mark Zuckerberg Answers to Congress For Facebook's Troubles Author: Issie Lapowsky Issie Lapowsky facebook Watch Mark Zuckerberg Testify Before Congress Right Here Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett COPPA Groups Allege YouTube Is Violating Law That Protects Kids Author: Nitasha Tiku Nitasha Tiku WIRED Opinion Beyond Facebook: It’s High Time for Stronger Privacy Laws Author: Jessica Rich Jessica Rich security roundup The US Gets Tough With Putin's Inner Circle Author: Brian Barrett Brian Barrett Law Enforcement Feds Seize Backpage.com, Site Linked to Sex Trafficking Author: Nitasha Tiku Nitasha Tiku We Recommend Powered By Outbrain Issie Lapowsky Facebook Imposes New Restrictions on Ads and Popular Pages Nitasha Tiku One Woman Got Facebook to Police Opioid Sales On Instagram Tom Simonite Google Turns to Users to Improve Its AI Chops Outside the US Issie Lapowsky The Question Only Mark Zuckerberg Can Answer Before Congress Tom Simonite Ex-Google Executive Opens a School for AI, With China's Help Get Our Newsletter WIRED’s biggest stories delivered to your inbox. submit Subscribe Advertise Site Map Press Center FAQ Accessibility Help Customer Care Contact Us Securedrop T-Shirt Collection Newsletter Wired Staff Jobs RSS CNMN Collection Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement (effective 3/21/12) and privacy policy (effective 3/21/12).

Congress Will Pay the Price Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images FCC chair Ajit Pai’s plan to repeal net neutrality provisions and reclassify broadband providers from “common carriers” to “information services” is an unprecedented giveaway to big broadband providers and a danger to the internet. The move would mean the FCC would have almost no oversight authority over broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. WIRED OPINION ABOUT Ryan Singel ( @rsingel ) is media and strategy fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and the CEO/cofounder of Contextly. For years, those broadband providers have used lawsuits and agency filings to fight FCC oversight and overturn its authority to prevent net neutrality abuses. But never in those companies’ most feverish dreams did they expect an FCC chair would propose to demolish all net neutrality protections and allow ISPs to extract tolls from every business in the country. Even industry analysts who expected the reclassification of broadband providers from Title II common carriers to Title I information services were stunned. Following Pai’s announcement, independent cable analyst Craig Moffett sent out an email to investors entitled "Shock and Awe and Net Neutrality," writing , “We've known since the election that the FCC would reverse Title II. But we never expected this . Yesterday’s FCC Draft Order on Net Neutrality went much further than we ever could've imagined in not only reversing Title II, but in dismantling virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.” If Congress allows Pai’s plan to pass, all that will be left of FCC oversight of broadband providers is a weak disclosure requirement: If Verizon, for example, wants to block content, charge sites to be viewable on its network, or create paid fast lanes, the company will simply have to tell its subscribers in their contract’s fine print. (Broadband providers won’t have to disclose, and the FCC won’t have control over, the sneakier ways they’ve found to mess with the internet.) Enforcement will be left to the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that’s never enforced open internet rules and has no ability to formulate its own. The FTC won’t even be able to protect consumers against most net neutrality violations after the fact, and nor will it be able to protect consumers against greedy broadband providers. And violations will come if Pai’s plan passes. AT&T's Ed Whitacre summarized broadband providers’ true motivations best back in 2005 : “Why should they be allowed to use my pipes?" he said. "The internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes free is nuts.” Verizon echoed that sentiment in 2013 when it sued to challenge the 2010 open internet rules. It told a federal court that as an “information service” it had the right to charge online services like Yelp access fees simply to work on its network and should be able block those sites from Verizon subscribers if Yelp didn’t pay. (Verizon won that case, leading to the 2015 order and the reclassification of broadband providers as “common carriers.”) The 2015 order, replacing the one Verizon had overturned, recognized this as a threat and prohibited ISPs from charging sites and services simply to reach their users. Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, thinks this would be innovative. Now his plan would usher in a radical upending of how the internet has worked in the US since its inception. Every website could have to pay more to simply be online; prices for online services would likely rise as companies start to pay broadband providers to be in fast lanes, while broadband providers would find even sneakier ways to enact tolls on the internet, free of any agency able to set rules to stop them.

Today, small and medium-size businesses rely on a myriad online business services for internal communications, sales, and accounting, to name just a few. Slack, Dropbox, Gusto, Quickbooks, and thousands more would have to pay access charges and fast-lane fees, costs they would likely have to pass to their customers. Non-mainstream media news sources across the political spectrum would no longer be able to afford to compete in the marketplace of ideas. Even churches that now reach their members online with streaming sermons, video libraries, and online video chats, would no longer be protected from blocking or access fees. Americans understand this and are rightly freaking out. Since the order was released, they’ve flooded Congress with more than half a million calls, and that’s only counting calls placed through the site BattleForTheNet.com. The citizen outrage crosses party lines; net neutrality is more popular than both parties combined . A poll this summer found that 77 percent of Americans support the current protections, including 73 percent of Republicans. This is not surprising. History has shown that internet freedom is the new third rail of US politics. In 2012, a bipartisan majority of Congress was dead set on passing SOPA , a law ostensibly intended to stop online copyright infringement but which would have threatened huge swaths of the internet. All conventional wisdom said it was a done deal. Then, freedom-loving people of the internet melted representatives' phone lines after a day of online action in January 2012. Even SOPA’s biggest supporters had to concede the internet killed SOPA. When online bots poisoned the net neutrality comment period, FCC chair Ajit Pai shrugged it off. In 2014, when the FCC set out to replace the struck-down 2010 net neutrality protections, conventional D.C. wisdom suggested that preserving net neutrality by designating broadband companies as common carriers was politically impossible. But millions of Americans proved otherwise. When TV host John Oliver pleaded with viewers to contact the FCC in support of net neutrality, they responded at such volume that the agency’s website crashed. That resulted in a win: limited but well-defined FCC net neutrality rules which, for the first time in FCC history, survived court challenges. Then in March, Congressional Republicans used a little-known legislative tool to repeal FCC rules that required broadband providers to get permission to track their subscribers’ every moves online for advertising purposes. That vote blew up in their faces when Republicans came back to their districts and held town hall meetings, where the politicians’ arguments that they voted to strike down the rule because it didn’t apply to online companies like Google did little to appease voter anger. That’s already likely to be an issue in the 2018 midterms. So far senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) is the only Republican member of Congress who has explicitly criticized Pai’s plan and has come out on the side of the internet. As the appointed head of an independent agency, Pai is technically free to ignore the American public. He’s done just that, saying that he doesn’t care about public sentiment. Pai did nothing when online bots poisoned the net neutrality comment period and posted anti net neutrality submissions using Americans’ names without their permission or knowledge. Instead of taking this corruption of a democratic process seriously, Pai shrugged it off . And while the FCC held multiple public hearings with participation from experts during previous net neutrality actions in 2008, 2010, and 2015, this time around Pai didn’t hold a single one. Voters know Republicans in Congress are the only ones who can stop Pai, and they should keep calling . If enough Republicans tell Pai to stop, he will likely back down. After all, congressional pressure has stopped the FCC before. Members of Congress face a choice: They can side with their constituents, who overwhelmingly want them to defend the greatest communication and innovation platform ever invented, or support one of the most blatant anticonsumer corporate giveaways in modern history. Some lawmakers believe the current FCC protections are the right solution, and others think that Congress should step in with a legislative solution to settle the matter once and for all. But all should agree that Pai’s plan to repeal the protections without a replacement is reckless and unnecessary. There’s no crisis Pai needs to save us from. The only crisis looming is the one that Pai’s plan will create for entrepreneurs, free markets, free speech, and for Republican members of Congress running for reelection who didn’t make the choice to stop Pai when they had the chance.

Nothing short of an extinction-level event will prevent it. But before abandoning all hope, know that while the battle for net neutrality at the FCC may have been lost, the war isn’t even close to a conclusion. In reality, the net neutrality fight is merely migrating to a different theater, namely, the US Courts of Appeals. And excluding the possibility of a Supreme Court challenge, the outcome may very well drag on for another year and a half or more. In roughly two weeks, the FCC’s three Republican commissioners, led by its chairman, Ajit Pai, will vote to adopt what’s known as the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. As the minority, the two Democrats who serve on the commission, both of which favor net neutrality, will be powerless to stop them. This order will replace and reverse the Open Internet Order, which was passed in 2015 and reclassified broadband internet service under Title II of the Communications Act—the legal foundation upon which the former administration established the “open internet” regulations imposed on internet service providers (ISPs). After the vote Without net neutrality, ISPs like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon will legally be able to conduct their businesses very differently than they do now. For example, they could give preferential treatment to services they directly profit from and block those they don’t, all the while charging internet companies like Netflix additional fees for speedier access to consumers—costs that you can count on being reflected in your monthly billing statement. Advertisement While several major ISPs have essentially promised never to do any these terrible, no good, very bad things, they’ve steadily opposed any law that would actually stop them. (Comcast actually deleted its promise after Pai announced the vote, Ars Technica reported Wednesday.) Publicly, ISPs claim the rules hinder innovation, a talking point frequently echoed by the FCC’s majority. Privately, we’ve learned, stockholders are being told the exact opposite . To be clear, when the FCC says that it is “restoring internet freedom,” it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers. The FCC’s new order, which seeks to abdicate its own authority to regulate an entire industry—not something you see every day—is unlikely to surface immediately after the vote. The two Democrats on the commission, Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, will likely file dissents, or minority reports detailing why, specifically, they disagree with the 200-page order (a draft of which was released last week .) And when they do, Pai and his two fellow Republican commissioners, Michael O’Rielly and Brendan Carr, will likely take some time to counter those concerns in print, if only in preparation for the long legal battle that lies ahead. Advertisement Afterwards, a brief period of legal chaos will ensue. Or at least, it will appear that way to anyone who hasn’t spent  a decade with their face buried in legal textbooks. For certain, there will be numerous lawsuits—or “petitions for review,” more specifically—filed in reaction to the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. “...if you file too soon it doesn’t count, but if you miss the deadline you lose your opportunity to choose the court.” We can’t be sure of how many tech companies, trade associations, and interest groups will avail themselves of judicial system and demand scrutiny of the FCC’s plan, but we know that many will seek an outright reversal of the order. Others may challenge only portions of the order, such as the provisions which “preempt” state and local governments that may try to pass their own laws to protect consumers from ISP abuse. Advertisement For many attorneys it’s “wait and see.” Much of the courtroom strategy, which no one is eager to reveal this early in the game, may be determined by the venue. That brings us to the first skirmish in this grueling legal process: Where will net neutrality’s fate be decided? While the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has heard three net neutrality cases in the past few years and therefore seems more appropriate, the case could theoretically wind up in one of eleven other circuit courts. In many ways it’s like winning the lottery, literally speaking. The fight over jurisdiction Petitions asking the courts to review the FCC’s order will be filed with appellate courts across the US. But only one court can hear the case. The process to determine which is, as one litigator described it, a “lawyer fight.” Organizations that want to be involved in the suit will have 60 days to file, but they’ll have only 10 days to get involved if they want a say in where the case will be heard. Advertisement It’s not immediately clear when that 10-day window opens. In some cases, it’s opened the minute the FCC publishes the order; in others, the attorneys have had to wait until after the order is added to the federal register—the government’s daily journal in which all rules, proposed rules, and public notices are published. “The statute is kind of weird,”  Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Gizmodo. “You’re not allowed to file until the order is ‘final’ so if you file too soon it doesn’t count, but if you miss the deadline you lose your opportunity to choose the court.” To avoid any confusion, the litigants who are truly determined to have a say in jurisdiction are likely to file  what’s called a “protective filing” at the earliest possible date—only to file again after the order hits the federal register, which may take a couple of weeks. Advertisement The multidistrict lottery The reason for this 10-day window—during which all filings are considered to have been filed simultaneously—is pretty simple: In days past, jurisdiction was determined by whomever filed first. But with lawyers filing in multiple states simultaneously, the process for deciding which attorney crossed the finish line first became unrealistic. And so the courts decided to leave it up to chance. After the 10-day window, each circuit district in which a lawsuit has been filed is entered into a lottery held by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation . “They plug into a computer the circuits which are competing and it picks a random number and that’s where they then assign all of the cases,” Feld said. Each circuit court is only entered into the lottery once, regardless of how many individual suits were filed there. Advertisement While the FCC does not have a say in this process (they aren’t suing themselves) there is an opportunity for those who oppose net neutrality to get involved—but only if they’re willing to object to some provision in the FCC’s order. Gigi Sohn, a former counsel to ex-FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, said the draft order didn’t appear to contain anything the ISPs would be eager to appeal at first blush. “I’m sure they’ll try to find something,” she said. By finding some small point to sue over, she added, the ISPs  can increase the odds of getting the case into a more favorable court. But this could also backfire, others say. “If they were to do something like that, it might carry the unfortunate perception of forum shopping on their part,” said Pantelis Michalopoulos, a telecom partner at the law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP. Advertisement Challenging the lottery “Even then it’s not over,” said Matt Wood, policy director at Free Press, one the interest groups that has already declared its intent to combat the order. “People can make motions to the court that it lands in to transfer it to another court.” Wood continued: “It’s not always the case that a court wants to surrender jurisdiction, especially over a high-profile item, but if you can make a case that this is really the same case that was heard in the DC circuit last time around, or because I’m here—whoever I am, some party—and my standing is especially good and this venue is especially relevant. You can make those arguments.” In other words, if the lottery selects, for instance, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which includes the the states Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Tennessee, one or more of the parties involved may, hypothetically, argue that the DC court is better equipped due its experience handling net neutrality cases. But how that would play out for either side is a bit of a toss up. Advertisement “It’s interesting, because until Obama appointed a couple of new judges, the DC circuit was considered to be very anti-regulatory and very pro-business,” Feld said. But that largely changed in 2014 after Obama appointed three judges who typically deferred to the agency. “Does that mean they’ll defer to the agency again? That’s an interesting strategic question,” Feld continued. “The other thing is, you have a bunch of precedent now in the DC circuit that arguably is very favorable to those who want to oppose what the FCC is doing, and unfavorable to the FCC.” Of course, the FCC could draw a panel of friendly conservative judges in DC and have a breezy time of it. But whether a challenge like this will occur or what effect the venue will have on the case is largely a matter of speculation for now. Advertisement “It’s like everything in government... It’s never really over. It’s not supposed to be.” As for any parties who didn’t participate in this initial scramble, they’ll still have that 60-day window to join the case, or else as an intervener—a non-party the court grants may be affected by the outcome, on either side of the case. This could mean a trade group representing tech giants like Google or Netflix—if they don’t join the lawsuit itself, which they certainly may—or it could be a group representing AT&T, Verizon and the like. Court convenes When we eventually get to court, one or more of the litigants, perhaps one of the smaller tech companies that joins the suit, may ask the court to issue a preliminary injunction, or what the appellate courts called a “stay.” If granted, this would prevent the FCC’s order, or perhaps just portions of it, from going into effect until the court renders a decision. Advertisement The challenge for anyone seeking a stay, however, lies not in demonstrating long-term harm from the rules, but imminent and irreparable injury. For this reason, many experts believe it is unlikely the ISPs will jump at the opportunity to launch any new business plans taking advantage of their newfound freedom. Doing so could inadvertently aid anyone petitioning for a stay, providing them with a real-life example of how the ISPs new behavior will irreparably damage their business. The remainder of the case should play out rather simply, though it remains unclear whether the parties opposing the FCC will be bundled together, or able to argue their cases independently. This depends on the rules of the court in which they convene and, potentially, on whether or not the litigants’ complaints about the order are dramatically divergent. Regardless, we’ll hear (or read, at least, since recording devices are banned in the DC court and others) a series of oral arguments for and against Pai’s order. Advertisement Outside parties will also have the opportunity to file amicus briefs, also known as “friend of the court” briefs, defending or opposing points of the order. The decision “The important thing to know about this process is really related to the merits,” said Michalopoulos, who spoke to Gizmodo last week shortly before the draft order was released. “If the FCC order is consistent with what has been reported, and what the chairman statements suggest, it is likely to be very vulnerable on appeal. So while it may take a long time, that’s the key fact about the appellate process. At the end of a long tunnel, there may well be a decision that disagrees with the order.” Advertisement In the case that court does not side entirely with the FCC, that decision may be an outright reversal of the order, a remand to the agency for further proceedings, or just a partial remand. In other words, there’s a distinct possibility that only portions of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order will be reversed. Or maybe none of it. “It’s like everything in government, especially in administrative processes and rulemakings,” Wood said. “It’s never really over. It’s not supposed to be. It’s a continuing conversation.” And there’s always the chance this ends up in the hands of the Supreme Court, whose makeup by that time may be entirely different. The judicial review of Pai’s order could very well extend into the next White House administration. The war for net neutrality in other words has only just begun.

Despite last-minute requests to delay the December 14 vote from some Republican members of Congress, it went through as scheduled, thanks to the support of a much longer list of Republicans who favored the repeal and urged the vote to be held without delay. As had been heavily predicted for months , the vote was split 3-2 along party lines, with the FCC chair Ajit Pai and the other Republican members Michael O’Rielly and Brendan Carr voting for repeal and Democratic commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel voting to protect it.  The vote to repeal came in spite of overwhelming bipartisan support for net neutrality from the public, as the FCC was clearly determined to move ahead with the repeal. Tensions were high during the hearing — and at one point, in the middle of Pai’s remarks, the room was evacuated for about 10 minutes due to an apparent security threat.    We are being evacuated by security during net neutrality vote at FCC — CeciliaKang (@ceciliakang) December 14, 2017     The implications of the repeal are vast and complicated. If it’s left unchallenged, it will almost certainly fundamentally change how people access and use the internet. But it could be a long time before we start to see the full effects of the FCC’s vote — and there’s even a ghost of a chance that the repeal might be overturned by the US Court of Appeals.  Here’s what you need to know about what could happen next.          Protesters at a 2015 net neutrality rally .  Media Action Grassroots Network    1) What was the FCC actually voting on?  The FCC voted on the Restoring Internet Freedom Order , which concerned the repeal of Title II protection for net neutrality.  Title II is a decades-old regulatory clause that explicitly classifies internet service providers (ISPs) as telecommunications companies, meaning they’re essentially classified as utilities and subject to the same regulations that other telecommunication companies — also classified as utilities — must abide by. That basic regulatory standard is what people are referring to when they talk about net neutrality. Title II was first applied to ISPs in 2015, after a hard-won fight by internet activists.  Placing ISPs under Title II was the only legal way — barring the unlikely introduction and passage  of Congressional legislation instituting complicated new regulatory procedures — in which these companies could be regulated. Now that the FCC has repealed Title II classification for ISPs, the ISPs will essentially be unregulated.  2) Why does it matter if ISPs are regulated or not?  Classifying ISPs as utility companies under Title II meant they had to treat the internet like every other utility — that is, just like gas, water, or phone service — and that they couldn’t cut off service at will or control how much of it any one person received based on how much that person paid for it. The idea was that the internet should be a public service that everyone has a right to use, not a privilege, and that regulating ISPs like utilities would prevent them from hijacking or monopolize that access.  The best argument for the rollback of this Title II protection is that maybe the internet isn’t a public service — maybe it’s just another product, and in a free market system, competition over who gets to sell you that product would ensure accountability and fair treatment among providers, if only due to economic self-interest .   Related  "Net neutrality is the secret sauce that has made the internet awesome"   But there’s a huge problem with that argument, which is that, as far as the internet is concerned, there really isn’t a free and open market . In the United States, competition among ISPs was driven down years ago thanks to the consolidated nature of internet broadband infrastructure, which has typically been owned by major corporations, shutting out local ISP competitors.  That’s why many people don’t really have much choice about which company they pay for internet access — that access has been monopolized by a handful of powerful companies. In fact, nearly 50 million households have only one high-speed ISP in their area.   Related  Net neutrality isn’t the only way to keep the internet fair. It’s just the only way in America.   In other words, these particular utility companies, now unregulated, have free reign to behave like the corporate monopolies they are. Where net neutrality ensured the preservation of what’s been dubbed “the open internet,” its repeal will open the door for ISPs to create “ an internet for the elite .”  3) What will happen to the internet without net neutrality protections in place?  Net neutrality mandated that ISPs display all websites, at the same speed, to all sources of internet traffic. Without net neutrality, all bets are off.  That means ISPs will be free to control what you access on the internet, meaning they will be able to block access to specific websites and pieces of software that interact with the internet.  They might charge you more or less money to access specific “bundles” of certain websites, much as cable television providers do now — but instead of “basic cable,” you might be forced to pay for access to more than a “basic” number of websites, as this popular pro-net neutrality graphic illustrates:          ISPs will also be able to control how quickly you’re served webpages, how quickly you can download and upload things, and in what contexts you can access which websites, depending on how much money you pay them.  They’ll be able to  charge you more to access sites you currently visit for free, cap how much data you’re allowed to use, redirect you from sites you are trying to use to sites they want you to use instead, and block you from being able to access apps, products, and information offered by their competitors or other companies they don’t like.  They can even block you from being able to access information on certain topics, news events, or issues they don’t want you to know about.  Finally, they’ll be able to exert this power not just over individual consumers, but over companies, as well. This could result in the much-discussed “ internet fast lane ” — in which an ISP forces a company like Twitter or BitTorrent to pay more for faster access for readers or users like you to its websites and services. Larger, more powerful companies likely won’t be hurt by this change. Smaller companies and websites almost definitely will be.  We already have a good idea of how these scenarios might play out, because in the era before net neutrality existed, ISPs tried instituting all of them: via jacked-up fees , forced redirection , content-blocking , software-blocking , website-blocking , competitor-blocking and still more competitor-blocking , app-blocking and still more app-blocking , data-capping , and censorship of controversial subjects .  If net neutrality advocates have made it seem like there’s simply no end to the worst-case scenarios that unregulated ISPs might subject us to, it’s because they’ve learned from experience. This history of ISP exploitation is a major reason that advocates for net neutrality fought so hard for it to begin with.  We also know that many ISPs, notably Comcast , already have their eyes on the aforementioned “fast lane,” also known as “paid prioritization.” (Disclaimer: Comcast is an investor in Vox’s parent company, Vox Media, through its NBC-Universal arm.)  And lest you believe that the current FCC is prepared to make sure that such offenses are fully sanctioned and dealt with by the government, think again. FCC chair Pai is a vocal proponent of letting ISPs self-regulate, and seems perfectly content to ignore their contentious and often predatory history.  Not only that, but the FCC is explicitly preventing state consumer protection laws from taking effect regarding net neutrality. That means that once the repeal is final, the rights of states to govern themselves won’t apply to protecting net neutrality. (Though California and Washington each vowed after the vote to try to protect it anyway.)  4) Who will be most affected by the repeal of net neutrality?  Women, minorities, rural communities, and internet developers will feel the fullest effects of this repeal.  The general argument among net neutrality advocates is that without an open internet, members of society who have historically been marginalized and silenced will be in danger of being further marginalized and silenced, or marginalized and silenced once more — particularly women and minorities .  We’ve seen in the past that ISPs can and will censor access to controversial subjects. Without regulation, situations could arise in which underprivileged or disenfranchised individuals and groups have less access to speak up or contact others online.  One worst-case scenario that we haven’t yet seen in America, but which is worth considering given the current heated political climate, is that ISPs could potentially play a role in limiting or marginalizing certain communities during times of urgency — for instance, an ISP might choose to block a mobilizing hashtag like #BlackLivesMatter at the start of an organic protest.  This might seem like a dire prediction, but there’s precedent for it: In 2011, the Egyptian government heavily censored certain websites during the Arab Spring. And in Turkey, under the administration of President Erdogan, the country has become notorious for censoring websites and blocking hashtags, at one point banning Twitter altogether .  Rural areas of the US — where internet access is already scarce due to a lack of ISPs operating there — will be further subjected to corporatization and monopolization of their internet infrastructure.  More than 10 million Americans already lack broadband access, and as the Hill notes in an overview of the potential impact of net neutrality’s repeal, “Good broadband is a small town’s lifeline out of geographic isolation, its connection to business software and services, and its conduit for exporting homegrown ideas and products.” Without regulatory inducements, corporate ISPs will have little incentive to develop infrastructure in such areas.  Another group that will be heavily impacted by net neutrality’s repeal — one that’s often overlooked but extremely crucial — is innovators and developers and people who create stuff for the internet. Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the internet as we know it, recently summed up the repeal’s potential effect on these developers:  If US net neutrality rules are repealed, future innovators will have to first negotiate with each ISP to get their new product onto an internet package. That means no more permissionless space for innovation. ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load. In other words, they’ll be able to decide which companies succeed online, which voices are heard  —  and which are silenced.  Again, this all sounds pretty dire — but that’s because it is. The people with the most expertise, the most investment in creating a progressive internet, and the strongest ability to advocate for an open internet could be prevented from doing their best work because of a lack of ability to pay for access to an ISP-controlled space.  It’s important to note, too, that because the nature of the repeal is unprecedented, we can’t necessarily predict every group and demographic that could potentially feel its impact.  5) Why did the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality when it had such overwhelming bipartisan support, and when the effects of a repeal seem so dire?  Pretty much everybody supports net neutrality — it’s one of the few bipartisan issues that most of Congress and most American citizens agree on. The glaring exceptions are the giant ISPs who are reigned in by the regulation.  Over the last nine years, Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T have collectively spent over half a billion dollars lobbying the FCC to end regulatory oversight, and especially to block or repeal net neutrality. They found a loyal friend in Pai, who was appointed to the FCC in 2012 by then President Barack Obama, and named chairman by President Donald Trump shortly after Trump took office  in January. Pai previously worked for Verizon and voted against the 2015 net neutrality ruling as a minority member of the FCC, calling it a “massive intrusion in the internet economy.”  So Pai has basically always supported the repeal of net neutrality , despite the overwhelming public support for it. He believes the 2015 ruling was frivolous and unnecessary , and has also argued, in opposition to hard evidence , that investment in the internet shrinks when net neutrality is in effect. With Trump’s full backing, he has made undoing it a priority.  In fact, even though Pai is legally required to seriously consider the voice of the public when he makes decisions, he has made it clear that he never truly intended to consider most of the millions of comments submitted in support of net neutrality through the FCC’s website since it began the repeal process in May. That’s because the vast majority of those comments were duplicates that came through automated third-party advocacy websites. While many of them were likely submitted by spambots using fake or stolen identities and emails to file comments, many more of them were likely submitted by people using the tried-and-true method of sending a form letter to the government to express their opinions. Pai also rejected the form letters out of hand: Once the number of duplicate comments came to light, the FCC declared that it would be rejecting all duplicated comments as well as “opinions” that came without “introducing new facts.”  Essentially, even though nearly 99 percent of the unique comments that the FCC received were pro-net neutrality and anti-repeal, and even though the entire point of a democratic process is to allow people to express their opinions, the FCC chose to dismiss pretty much every opinion that was expressed, because spambots and auto-duplicated opinions were involved. FCC commissioner Rosenworcel, one of the commission’s two minority Democrats, acknowledged this during the December 14 vote to repeal, noting "the cavalier disregard this agency has demonstrated to the public.”  As Dell Cameron at Gizmodo put it , “To be clear, when the FCC says that it is ‘restoring internet freedom,’ it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers.”  6) What happens now, in the immediate aftermath of the vote?  A flurry of lawsuits from tech companies, internet activists, and think tanks will likely descend upon Washington — starting with a protective filing by internet activists that will appeal the FCC’s vote to prevent the repeal from immediately taking effect.  Mere hours after the FCC vote, the Attorney General of the state of New York announced a multi-state appeal of the ruling , to which a number of other states quickly signed on. The exact number of states participating in the appeal will grow over the coming weeks — technically after a suit is announced, the states (as well as any latecomers to any other lawsuits filed) will have 60 days to join in before the suit closes.  These lawsuits will petition the US Court of Appeals for a review of the FCC’s order. After a filing period of 10 days, all of the lawsuits will eventually be punted collectively to one of the Court of Appeals’ 12 circuit courts, and the ultimate outcome will be largely dependent on which court hears the appeals.  If the repeal does eventually go into effect, the FCC will institute one very thin piece of ISP regulation in place of net neutrality — a version of a 2010 transparency ruling that requires ISPs to inform consumers when the ISPs are deliberately slowing their internet speed. The FCC will be passing off the enforcement of this transparency stipulation to the FTC, in a long-planned and recently formalized agreement that will allow the two commissions “to work together to take targeted action against bad actors.”  7) When will the repeal go into effect?  We simply can’t know at this point. Establishing a workable timeline will depend on a whole heap of factors , such as which circuit court ends up hearing the appeals, whether there is a motion to relocate the appeals to another court, any motions or counter-motions filed on the appeals, and so forth. There’s also the likelihood that net neutrality advocates will ask for stays of the FCC’s ruling so that it can’t take effect while motions are still being heard and appeals are being deliberated.  Additionally, there’s one alternative to the appeals process that’s definitely a longshot, yet still a possibility: Congress could move to pass a joint resolution overturning the repeal and establishing new regulatory oversight. However, given how firmly many Republican politicians have stood behind Pai’s repeal campaign, this seems highly unlikely to happen unless the 2018 midterm elections result in a major upheaval of Congress, and could take years to hash out.  In a nutshell, we don’t know how long will it take to fight the repeal in the court system, so we can’t know when — or if — it will take effect. It’s likely that even if a court overturns the FCC’s decision, that court may only overturn part of it and not the entire thing.  What the final version of a net neutrality repeal might look like, and when it might take effect, are both unknown at this point, with the future of an open internet hanging in the balance.

Jon Brodkin - Nov 22, 2017 9:08 pm UTC         Enlarge  / FCC Chairman Ajit Pai at The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research on May 5, 2017 in Washington, DC. Getty Images | Chip Somodevilla     reader comments  286    Share this story         Net neutrality rules are popular with Americans who use the Internet. When the Federal Communications Commission deliberated on possible net neutrality rules in 2014 and 2015, millions of comments poured in to support strict regulation of Internet service providers.  Public opinion helped push the FCC to adopt rules that prevent ISPs from blocking or throttling Internet content and from charging websites or other online services for priority treatment on the network.  Public opinion hasn't changed much in the two-plus years that the rules have been on the books. The cable lobby surveyed registered voters this year and found that most of them continue to support bans on blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. Multiple polls have found that net neutrality rules are popular with both Democratic and Republican voters . Further Reading RIP net neutrality: FCC chair releases plan to deregulate ISPs  It was thus no surprise to see a huge backlash to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to eliminate the rules. While most of the 22 million public comments on the plan were spam and form letters, a study funded by the broadband industry found that 98.5 percent of unique comments supported the current rules. Net neutrality supporters organized an  "Internet-wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality" in July and plan more protests in the coming days as a final vote draws near.  But net neutrality rules have some vocal and influential opponents. The most prominent are Republican politicians and regulators, conservative think tanks, and the Internet service providers that have to follow the rules. Those are the voices that counted most in Pai's decision to eliminate popular consumer protection regulations.  Pai's full proposal is available here and is expected to be approved in a commission vote on December 14.  FCC official explains why comments can be dismissed  A senior FCC official spoke with reporters about Pai's anti-net neutrality plan in a phone briefing yesterday and explained why the FCC is not swayed by public opinion on net neutrality.  The vast majority of comments consisted of form letters from both pro- and anti-net neutrality groups and generally did not introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments, the official from Pai's office said. In general, the comments stated opinions or made assertions and did not have much bearing on Pai's decision, the official said. The official spoke with reporters on the condition that he not be named and that his comments can be paraphrased but not quoted directly.  The official noted that many of the comments are fraudulent. He said that there were 7.5 million identical comments that came from 45,000 unique names and addresses, apparently due to a scammer who repeatedly submitted the same comment under a series of different names.  The message from this FCC official seemed to be that a huge percentage of the comments can be safely ignored. But the docket is filled with these comments because the FCC took no significant steps to prevent fraud and did not delete even the most obviously fraudulent comments from the record.  Allowing the docket to be filled with junk made it easier for Pai's office to argue that the comments should not be seen as a legitimate expression of public opinion.  Pai's office has also refused to provide evidence for an investigation into fraudulent comments, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said yesterday . Schneiderman said that there was "a massive scheme that fraudulently used real Americans' identities" in order to "drown out the views of real people and businesses."  Pai likes public opinion—when it agrees with him  The FCC isn't required to follow public opinion, but Pai favorably cites public opinion when it suits him.  On net neutrality, Pai and his staff have consistently said that they would consider the quality of the comments rather than the quantity on each side. Yet in another recent decision to eliminate a regulation, Pai took the opposite approach.  "The overwhelming majority of public input favored our proposal," he said before a recent vote, while urging his fellow commissioners to eliminate a decades-old rule that required TV and radio stations to maintain studios in the local communities they serve.  FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, urged the FCC to hold public hearings across the country before eliminating net neutrality rules. Hearings are necessary to get Americans' opinions because of the spam bots, impersonation, and other problems marring the FCC's docket, she argued.  "I've called for public hearings before any change is made to these rules, just as Republican and Democratic commissions have done in the past," Rosenworcel said yesterday . "We should go directly to the American public to find out what they think about this proposal before any vote is taken to harm net neutrality."  Comments that count more than others  The Pai staffer who spoke with reporters acknowledged that there were legitimate comments from both sides in the net neutrality docket. In Pai's draft order, the FCC comprehensively addresses all the serious comments that made factual and legal arguments, the official said.  Pai's order, not surprisingly, speaks favorably of research in the docket that supports his claim that broadband network investment fell as a result of net neutrality rules. The proposal then criticizes studies that found the opposite, saying they used methods that are "unlikely to yield reliable results" or have other problems.  Pai also was not swayed by the fact that ISPs themselves have told investors that the rules do not harm their network investments. That's significant because publicly traded companies are required by law to give investors accurate financial information, including a description of risk factors involved in investing in the company. Further Reading FCC refuses to release text of more than 40,000 net neutrality complaints  Another expression of public opinion comes in the form of complaints filed by consumers against their Internet providers. Yet the FCC initially refused to release the text of tens of thousands of those complaints .  Consumer advocacy groups wanted more time to review those complaints in order to submit analyses into the net neutrality docket. But when the FCC finally released more of them , the big document release came just one day before the deadline for the public to comment on the anti-net neutrality plan.  Pai's proposal says that the tens of thousands of complaints do not prove that the net neutrality rules solve any real problems. "The Commission takes consumer complaints seriously and finds them valuable in informing us about trends in the marketplace, but we reiterate that they are informal complaints that, in most instances, have not been verified," the proposal said.  Like Rosenworcel, Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn says that the opinion of Internet users should be taken more seriously by the commission.  Pai's proposal, she said , "ignores thousands of consumer complaints and millions of individual comments that ask the FCC to save net neutrality and uphold the principles that all traffic should be created equal."    Promoted Comments      shelbystripes  Ars Scholae Palatinae     jump to post    This should make for a nice lawsuit. You can't enact (or repeal) a rule without a genuine public comment period. If they keep being this shockingly dismissive of public comments in general, including an utter lack of attempt to distinguish real and fraudulent comments, they could see this rulemaking overturned. The irony is that the GOP just spent the past decade using courts to aggressively thwart rulemaking. Time to use those precedents against them. This is more blatantly egregious abuse of process than any rulemaking under the Obama administration that was struck down.       4209 posts | registered 6/13/2013                      Jon Brodkin Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.

Jon Brodkin - Dec 11, 2017 9:14 pm UTC         Enlarge  / Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai arrives for his confirmation hearing with the Senate Commerce Committee on July 19, 2017 in Washington, DC. Getty Images | Chip Somodevilla     reader comments  207    Share this story         The Federal Communications Commission is still on track to eliminate net neutrality rules this Thursday, but the commission said today that it has a new plan to protect consumers after the repeal.  The FCC and Federal Trade Commission released a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) describing how the agencies will work together to make sure ISPs keep their net neutrality promises.  After the repeal, there won't be any rules preventing ISPs from blocking or throttling Internet traffic. ISPs will also be allowed to charge websites and online services for faster and more reliable network access. Further Reading Comcast deleted net neutrality pledge the same day FCC announced repeal  In short, ISPs will be free to do whatever they want—unless they make specific promises to avoid engaging in specific types of anti-competitive or anti-consumer behavior. When companies make promises and break them, the FTC can punish them for deceiving consumers. That's what FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Acting FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen are counting on.  “Instead of saddling the Internet with heavy-handed regulations, we will work together to take targeted action against bad actors," Pai said in a joint announcement with the FTC today .  FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat who opposes the net neutrality repeal, is not impressed. She gave this statement to Ars:  The agreement announced today between the FCC and FTC is a confusing, lackluster, reactionary afterthought: an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the Chairman’s draft proposal repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules. Two years ago, the FCC signed a much broader pro-consumer agreement with the FTC that already covers this issue. There is no reason to do this again other than as a smoke-and-mirrors PR stunt, distracting from the FCC’s planned destruction of net neutrality protections later this week.  Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel agreed. FTC enforcement is no substitute for strict rules against blocking, throttling, and discrimination, she said. “Plus, FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact—many months, if not years, after consumers and businesses have been harmed,” she said in a statement to Ars. “This is why the FCC must not relinquish its authority and, more importantly, its responsibility, to the public interest.”  Promises, promises  Pai’s approach essentially lets ISPs pick and choose which net neutrality guidelines, if any, they want to follow.  Most major ISPs are—so far—still promising that they won’t block or throttle lawful Internet content. But net neutrality promises are eroding.  Comcast deleted a “no paid prioritization” pledge from its net neutrality webpage on the very same day that Pai announced his plan to repeal net neutrality rules, as we previously reported .  Ohlhausen confirmed again today that FTC jurisdiction hinges on those ISPs’ promises. This leaves open the possibility that ISPs could change promises related to blocking or throttling.  “The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” Ohlhausen said.  FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat, has said repeatedly that the FTC cannot enforce net neutrality as effectively as the FCC. The FCC has broad rule-making authority and expertise in network engineering that the FTC lacks, McSweeny told Ars in April . Further Reading FCC won’t delay vote, says net neutrality supporters are “desperate”  Moreover, the FTC’s jurisdiction over Internet service providers is uncertain. Pai’s plan would shift authority from the FCC to the FTC by eliminating the common carrier classification of broadband. But a pending court case involving AT&T could end up stripping the FTC of any regulatory authority over ISPs that also operate common-carrier phone networks.  AT&T’s attempt to eliminate FTC authority over any aspect of its business was initially successful when a panel of judges at the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in AT&T’s favor last year. A more recent court decision vacated AT&T’s victory, but a final ruling has not yet been issued. Despite this, Pai decided not to delay the vote on his plan for the FCC to relinquish authority over broadband providers.  “The FTC’s authority in this matter is in question, and an MOU does nothing to answer those concerns,” Rosenworcel said today.  ISPs’ public disclosures  Pai’s plan does require ISPs to make public disclosures of blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, prioritization of ISPs' own content, congestion management practices, and limitations imposed on specific types of applications or devices.  The FCC/FTC agreement relies partially on those disclosures. This is how the FCC and FTC describe the major parts of their collaboration:    The FCC will review informal complaints concerning the compliance of Internet service providers (ISPs) with the disclosure obligations set forth in the new transparency rule. Those obligations include publicly providing information concerning an ISP’s practices with respect to blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and congestion management. Should an ISP fail to make the required disclosures—either in whole or in part—the FCC will take enforcement action.  The FTC will investigate and take enforcement action as appropriate against ISPs concerning the accuracy of those disclosures, as well as other deceptive or unfair acts or practices involving their broadband services.  The FCC and the FTC will broadly share legal and technical expertise, including the secure sharing of informal complaints regarding the subject matter of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. The two agencies also will collaborate on consumer and industry outreach and education.    Consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge said that the FCC/FTC plan will not protect consumers from ISPs.  “Not only is the FCC eliminating basic net neutrality rules, but it’s joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public,” Public Knowledge VP Chris Lewis said . “This gives free rein to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you of it.”    Promoted Comments      trimeta  Ars Scholae Palatinae     jump to post    And what exactly will make the ISPs promise anything?

If the FCC really thinks the problem would solve itself, they need to nationalize all broadband pipeline and make the ISP service providers only. Only once you decouple the content provider from the infrastructure operator could you solve this problem.       1083 posts | registered 8/24/2012        LuDux  Ars Scholae Palatinae     jump to post    Does he realize he just admitted that net neutrality protects consumers?       1338 posts | registered 7/1/2012                      Jon Brodkin Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.

Here’s What to Expect                                                By John Patrick Pullen  December 13, 2017       The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) net neutrality vote is scheduled for Thursday, December 14, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, and has the potential to radically alter the internet as we know it.  The Commissioner of the FCC, Ajit Pai, appointed to his post by President Donald Trump, has proposed reclassifying internet providers from utilities to information companies, and the rest of the commission is due to vote on it Thursday. If the vote goes along party lines, net neutrality will be repealed and internet providers will be able to legally control the speed of content running through their network, a practice that is currently prohibited. But for many reasons, the net neutrality vote is a controversial one.  Here’s everything you need to know:      What is net neutrality?  If Thursday’s net neutrality vote is giving you déjà vu, you’re not alone. Net neutrality regulations were originally put in place just two years ago in February 2015, when the Obama-era FCC voted to regulate Internet companies like they were a utility. “There are no toll roads on the information superhighway,” President Barack Obama said when he called for a net neutrality vote in 2014.  Under the Obama-era net neutrality guidelines, broadband providers were classified as Title II or “common carriers,” which meant they couldn’t discriminate in the traffic that flowed through their traffic. But Pai prefers less regulation, and believes that if the companies are subject to fewer restrictions, they’ll invest in more technologies to push the internet forward.  This is more than just difference of philosophies. Net neutrality impacts everything from how fast movies are streamed on Netflix to how much companies will charge for online services.    When is the net neutrality vote?  The net neutrality vote on Thursday comes after months of public commentary and consideration over whether to maintain or rollback the regulations approved by the FCC during 2015. If approved, broadband internet companies will be recategorized as a Title I information services instead of Title II common carriers. This would allow the companies to throttle traffic from websites and allow other sites to move faster through paid prioritization.  Who is voting on net neutrality?  FCC Commissioner Pai leads a 3-2 Republican majority commission staffed by other, less notable (but not less influential) commissioners. A former general counsel for Verizon , the Obama-appointed Republican has drawn public ire for being a telecommunications industry “puppet,” something that he even joked about at a recent event. Pai has long been outspoken on his disagreement with the principles of net neutrality, well before Trump tapped him to chair the FCC.          President Obama's @FTC Chairman: after @FCC repeal of Internet regulations, "the sky isn’t falling. Consumers will remain protected, and the internet will continue to thrive." https://t.co/Nn3muFXnZC  — Ajit Pai (@AjitPaiFCC) December 13, 2017     Likely to vote to uphold net neutrality, Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn was also appointed by President Obama and is described by the FCC as “a longtime champion of consumers and a defender of the public interest.” Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel will also likely vote in favor of retaining net neutrality. The Democratic appointee has worked in communications law both privately and for the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.      Republican appointee Michael O’Rielly has been with the FCC since 2013, and is likely to vote against net neutrality. O’Rielly has a resume filled with legal jobs with Congress, both in representative and committee offices. The newest commissioner to the FCC, Brendan Carr, was nominated by Trump in August, and is expected to vote against net neutrality as well. Carr is not unfamiliar with the FCC — he previously served as the commission’s general counsel.  What is the net neutrality debate?  The substantive issues of the net neutrality debate ahead of tomorrow’s vote are more important than the sideshow that has popped up around them. But that said, #netneutrality, as a movement, has generated a fair deal of headlines.  Most seriously is the issue of whether the FCC’s commenting system has been compromised, and if so, by whom. According to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, 2 million comments submitted to the FCC were fake and used the stolen identities of real Americans . That’s an alarming problem, and one that Schneiderman says the FCC did nothing to investigate.      Stuffing the comment box was John Oliver’s net neutrality strategy of choice, something the host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight suggested through his “Go FCC Yourself” campaign. An ardent opponent of the Trump administration, Oliver launched a net neutrality protest campaign that was so successful, it even crashed the FCC’s website. (In response, the FCC has said the site was crashed by a cyber attack, and considering the two million fake messages, may very well be true — and reason for investigation.)  Many are wondering, does President Trump support net neutrality? With his penchant for hands-off regulations, it’s easy to assume that he doesn’t. Other than putting his support in Pai, Trump hasn’t weighed in on the topic in a long time — possibly since since 2014.          Obama’s attack  on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014     Interestingly enough, Twitter — which Trump loves — hates the idea of repealing net neutrality.          We, at Twitter, believe that #NetNeutrality is key to free expression, innovation & public safety. Tomorrow is a critical day for preserving these protections. https://t.co/8jknvlWN8T  — Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) December 13, 2017     Where can you watch the FCC net neutrality vote live?  With the future of streaming video at stake, it only makes sense that the FCC would live-stream the net neutrality vote. Follow along on the FCC’s website starting at 10:30 a.m.      What comes after the net neutrality vote?  In the unlikely event that the net neutrality vote preserves the regulations, nothing changes. But what’s more likely is that the rule change will pass on party-line voting 3-2 in favor of a net neutrality repeal. There’s always the possibility that a net neutrality bill would codify the protections into law, but that would involve a highly partisan Congress working together. It could happen — after all, Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of the FCC keeping net neutrality — but don’t hold your breath.  Instead, we’re more likely to see lawsuits as the next course of action in the net neutrality protest. According to Reuters, at least four groups — Common Cause, Free Press, the Internet Association, and Public Knowledge — have lawyers at the ready, weighing their legal options. And then it would be déjà vu all over again. In 2016, internet broadband providers sued the FCC over net neutrality protections — and lost.

The Republican-controlled FCC approved the proposal to repeal with a 3-2 vote along party lines, dismantling the Obama-era policy that requires internet providers to treat all web traffic equally.  FCC chief Ajit Pai, who previously worked for Verizon Communications before President Donald Trump appointed him to his role in January, proposed the change on Nov. 21 . “Today, I’m proposing to repeal the heavy-handed Internet regulations imposed by the Obama Administration and to return to the light-touch framework under which the Internet developed and thrived before 2015,” Pai wrote on Twitter the day of the announcement . (Trump reconfirmed Pai for a five year term in October.)  Ahead of the net neutrality vote Thursday, the FCC invited public comments on the upcoming vote and 23 million were submitted, though many of them came from bots or were submitted using other people’s names without their consent.      Net neutrality advocates protested outside the FCC vote and say they are prepared to sue in order to continue fighting the repeal. A poll from the University of Maryland showed that 83% of Americans do not approve of the FCC repealing net neutrality.  In Congress, the repeal has opponents from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) who sits on a subcommittee that oversees the FCC said on Tuesday that he plans to introduce legislation after the vote that would block the repeal from going into effect. Several Republicans voiced support for net neutrality and called for a bipartisan legislative solution to the issue rather than leaving the decision up to the FCC.  But what does net neutrality mean and how will it affect your Internet use if regulations are reversed? Here’s what you need to know right now.    What is net neutrality?  This term has been kicking around for several years, but most people struggle to define it.  When net neutrality is enforced, as it is right now, all internet service providers must allow equal access to apps and content, regardless of the source. If it were not enforced, your internet service provider could make it harder for you to access parts of the internet at its own discretion.  For a while it was a running joke that people knew net neutrality was important, but struggled to describe it. Back in 2015 (in the era of the dress debate ), Saturday Night Live did a sketch that hinged on none of the invited guests — all people who made a living on the web — understanding how these net neutrality policies would work.      John Oliver broke it down in 2014 on his show Last Week Tonight and again in May of this year , when the FCC announced that it would be accepting comments on the new net neutrality rules.  “’The Internet is the repository of all human knowledge — and goats singing Taylor Swift songs,’ said John Oliver on Last Week Tonight, rejoicing in the fact that the Internet is an incredible place,” wrote Time reporter Melissa Locker when the below clip first aired. “However, according to Oliver, that is threatened by the Trump administration’s decision to roll back protections for net neutrality.”           What will the internet look like without net neutrality?  Without the assurance of net neutrality, large internet companies could favor their own business interests. Telecom giants and Silicon Valley titans are likely to lobby lawmakers in the coming days and weeks, but for now, net neutrality could affect everything from internet speed to overall access.  Slower speeds  The elimination of net neutrality means that internet providers can carve up service into fast and slow lanes, charging more for higher speeds. Comcast could demand fees from Netflix , for example, in exchange for preferential treatment. (In response to the FCC plan, Netflix took to Twitter to show “strong support” for net neutrality.)  If content companies don’t want to pay, internet service providers could make them so slow that they’re unwatchable or even block access to competitors’ sites.          The FCC is getting ready to overturn #NetNeutrality . If they succeed, ISPs will be able to split the net into packages. This means that you will no longer be able to pay one price to access any site you want. pic.twitter.com/vEkNxPmVlu  — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) November 21, 2017     Higher prices  Reversing net neutrality rules could cost more to binge your favorite shows on Netflix or Hulu, to play video games , send messages on social media, or even to watch porn. These fees will likely be absorbed by consumers. So those with wallets fat enough for the price hike will enjoy higher speeds, but lower income browsers will get only a limited view of what was once a more open and egalitarian web.      More choices (maybe)  The argument for eliminating net neutrality posits that less regulation will lead to more investment and more competition in the internet service provider sector. FCC Chairman Pai said in May that this could benefit consumers and increase the number of Americans with internet access.  The lack of competition in certain areas of the country means that greater choice for customers would be hard to achieve and the biggest beneficiaries of eliminating net neutrality will be the largest internet service providers .  This change would likely result in paying for bundles or packages to access to different parts of the web, including social media sites like Twitter and Facebook , a model similar to the one that has worked out so well for cable .      Defending his proposal to repeal net neutrality in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Monday, Pai criticized web platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter for controlling what users see online, suggesting they restrict free expression.  “One of the things that people have suggested is it’s not Internet service providers, it’s some of the content companies that decide what you see on the Internet and, more importantly, what you don’t see. Where’s the transparency there? Shouldn’t we have a conversation that involves them, as well?” he said.  Which countries do not have net neutrality?  What’s happening in the U.S. isn’t without precedent.  In Portugal, there are no net neutrality rules and internet packages, like what’s described above, already exist. The other countries without net neutrality enforcement include Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, and Slovenia.

Explore Follow Innovation Net Neutrality share this Net Neutrality Decision Could be Stuck in the Courts for Years It won't go away overnight. By Alasdair Wilkins on November 28, 2017 Filed Under Politics Net neutrality is on life support at the FCC, and in two weeks, it’s expected that the Republican-controlled commission will vote to remove the consumer protections. The proposal circulated before Thanksgiving to end net neutrality goes to a vote when the FCC meets on December 14, with the vote expected to go 3-2 along party lines to approval his new rules. After years of debate, uncertainty, and reversals, that vote in two weeks means the end of net neutrality’s story at the FCC. But that doesn’t mean telecommunications companies like Comcast and AT&T will immediately be able to roll out tiered internet plans and start throttling site speeds. In all likelihood, the next stop for net neutrality will be the courts — and Pai figures to face an uphill battle to get judges to agree with his new rules.telecommunications companies like Comcast and AT&T will immediately be able to roll out tiered internet plans and start throttling site speeds. In all likelihood, the next stop for net neutrality will be the courts — and Pai figures to face an uphill battle to get judges to agree with his new rules. There’s a very simple reason for that: Federal agencies like the FCC can’t change existing rules just because they want to. The fact that a Trump appointee like Pai disagrees philosophically with the Obama-era FCC’s position on net neutrality isn’t in and of itself justification to change the rules. Pai and the FCC have to make a fact-based argument to do away with net neutrality. If they can’t do that, even a court full of Republican judicial appointees would be compelled to strike down the FCC’s decision and preserve net neutrality. Article continues below The revolution will not be televised. It'll be sent to your inbox by us. Sign up for our newsletter: sign up You can find Pai’s rationale right at the top of the text he circulated ahead of the December 14 meeting: “In 2015, the Commission imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulation on Internet service providers (ISPs),” he writes. “Since then, broadband investment has fallen for two years in a row — the first time that that’s happened outside a recession in the Internet era. And new services have been delayed or scuttled by a regulatory environment that stifles innovation.” Those are Pai’s key facts. Never mind any of the facts that weight against that — like the overwhelming public support for net neutrality or the fact that ISPs don’t actually create almost any of the content they send, which makes the FCC’s 2015 reclassification of telecoms from “information providers” to “common carriers” seem pretty intuitive. Those don’t even need to matter. If Pai’s own stated facts aren’t supportable, then there’s no legal basis for the end of net neutrality. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Pai has been making his arguments about reduced investment and innovation for a while now, and outside observers have repeatedly countered that his numbers don’t add up. No, seriously, a report this May from the Free Press Action Network was literally titled “Sorry, Chairman Pai: Your Investment Numbers Don’t Add Up.” By any metric — and the report stresses Pai’s preferred metric of total industry investment is actually one of the least precise ways to judge this, but even by that metric — spending has gone up since the 2015 decision. “Altogether, publicly traded ISPs spent approximately 5 percent more on capital investment during the two years after the FCC’s decision than they did in the two years prior. Far from declining or flatlining, aggregate industry investment has been growing,” the report finds. “Total capital spending across the three survey categories of broadband providers was $87.184 billion — more than $553 million higher than it was in 2014.” Is that simple refutation of Pai’s argument the entire ballgame? Maybe not. The FCC has its own figures — which net neutrality advocates have persuasively argued are disingenuous — and it will have lawyers to defend the validity of those numbers in court. The legal battle would likely prove protracted. Lasting clear until, say, January 2021, when it’s possible there will be a new president and, with that, a new FCC chairman. We run into this kind of story most often with the Environmental Protection Agency. Any new rule the agency puts forth — whether more pro-environment in the case of Democratic administrations, or more pro-industry in the case of Republican ones — faces months or even years of legal challenges from anyone with a stake. And in the case of net neutrality and FCC, everyone who uses the internet, plus giant companies like Amazon and Google that have every reason to stand against Pai’s proposal, would have a stake in keeping net neutrality tied up in the courts for as along as possible. The FCC figures to make net neutrality that much more vulnerable after its expected vote on December 14. That’s the end of the battle. It’s likely just the beginning of the war.
