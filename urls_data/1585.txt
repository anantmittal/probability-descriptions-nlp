Sex! (Or intercourse at the right time, to be technical about it.)  The 'fertile window' is when you should be having lots of sex if you want to conceive.  The fertile window  We’re talking about the days in a woman’s menstrual cycle when pregnancy is possible. The ‘fertile window’ depends on the length of a woman’s cycle, this varies between women.  Pregnancy is technically only possible during the five days before ovulation through to the day of ovulation. These six days are the ‘fertile window’ in a woman’s cycle, and reflect the lifespan of sperm (5 days) and the lifespan of the ovum (24 hours).  Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary, moves down the fallopian tube, and is available in the fallopian tube to be fertilised. If there is sperm waiting around at the time the egg is released, there is a higher chance that it will be fertilised. Ovulation happens about two weeks before the woman’s next expected period. So if her average menstrual cycle is 28 days, ovulation will happen around day 14.  If sex is timed five days before a woman’s ovulation, the probability of her getting pregnant is about 10%. The probability of pregnancy rises steadily until the two days before and including the day of ovulation. The likelihood of conceiving is dramatically increased if intercourse occurs in the three days leading up to and including ovulation.  At the end of a woman’s ‘fertile window’, the probability of pregnancy declines rapidly and by 12-24 hours after she ovulates, a woman is no longer able to get pregnant during that cycle.  Too complicated?  If your partner is not aware of her ‘fertile window’ or when she ovulates, she can find more information here . Otherwise, to cover all bases, sexual intercourse is recommended every 2 to 3 days to help optimise your chance of conceiving. But there’s no limit to how much sex you can have during that 6-day period.  The likelihood of actually becoming pregnant is dramatically increased if you have intercourse in the three days leading up to and including ovulation. If sex is timed well on any of these three days, she has a 27-33% chance of becoming pregnant. Adapted from data by Wilcox, A.J. et al. NEJM (1995) 333:1517 Myth conception The myth: "A woman can get pregnant any time of the month." The truth: The only time a woman can conceive is during the ‘fertile window’ of the menstrual cycle.  The ’fertile window’ in the menstrual cycle is the six days leading up to ovulation, when the egg is released from the ovary. This depends on how long the woman’s menstrual cycles are.  Not all women have the same length of cycle. If, on average, your partner has a period every 28 days the best chance of conceiving is between days 12 and 14 (with ovulation day on day 14). If she has a 24 -day cycle, then focus your efforts between days 7 and 10.

REGIMEN   EVERY  TIME     Info       Withdrawal Method  Do it properly.  The withdrawal method must be used, before your partner ejaculates, every single time you have
					sex. It’s extremely unreliable and only limits the chances of any sperm reaching the egg.

Withdrawal is also called coitus interruptus or the "pull out method" and it requires great self-control, experience, and trust, and as such, it is pretty unreliable. It works, some of the time, by the man taking his penis out of the vagina before he ejaculates, limiting the chances of any sperm reaching the egg. However, not all sperm are released at climax, some are a little more eager than that, so even though you don’t finish off, you could still finish up pregnant.                            HOW TO  The Withdrawal Method really isn’t rocket science, the man withdraws from inside you before climax to minimize the risk of sperm entering the vagina and therefore reaching the egg. The key word is minimize, sperm still escape, and escaped sperm can still fertilize eggs. Men who use the withdrawal method must be able to know when they are reaching the point in sexual excitement when ejaculation can no longer be stopped or postponed. If you cannot predict this moment accurately, withdrawal will not be as effective. Even if a man pulls out in time, pregnancy can still happen. Some experts believe that pre-ejaculate, or pre-cum, can pick up enough sperm left in the urethra from a previous ejaculation to cause pregnancy. This is not a method that would be recommended by healthcare providers, or by the millions of people who tried it, put an early stop to the fun, and got unplanned pregnant anyway.              PROS AND CONS    It isn’t affected by other medications  It can be used when breastfeeding  Hormone free      It’s extremely unreliable  It interrupts sex  Does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS       Are any sexual positions better than others when using the withdrawal method?    Withdrawal is also called coitus interruptus or the "pull out method" and it requires great self-control, experience, and trust, and as such, it is pretty unreliable. It works, some of the time, by taking the penis out of the vagina before you ejaculate, limiting the chances of any sperm reaching the egg. With each ejaculation you are releasing up to 400 Million sperms. However, not all sperm are released at climax, some are a little more eager than that and can survive inside a woman`s uterus for up to five days, so even though you don’t finish off, you could still finish up making her pregnant.        Will douching help to prevent pregnancy after coitus interruptus?    No not all, however it is far better to bathe and make sure that anything with ejaculate on it does not get near the vagina within one to six hours, their known lifespan outside the body.            Will the withdrawal method work even when ovulating?    Since a woman is most fertile in the few days prior to or after ovulation, it is never suggested that she have sexual intercourse during that time if she does not wish to get pregnant. Even the most foolproof methods of contraception do have a miniscule failure rate and as the withdrawal method is only 78% successful, it would be best to avoid having sexual relations during this time.        How effective is the withdrawal method?    Withdrawal is less effective than most other contraceptive methods. As commonly used, it is only 78 percent effective, meaning that 22 of every 100 women whose partners use withdrawal will become pregnant over a year.            Can everybody use the withdrawal method?    Withdrawal requires men to have good self-control. A man must be able and willing to withdraw the penis and ejaculate outside the woman’s body. If he does not withdraw before ejaculating, his partner may become pregnant. Also, a small amount of semen may be released into the vagina before the full ejaculation, possibly without the man realizing it. Even this small amount of semen may contain enough sperm to possibly cause a pregnancy and to transmit STIs/HIV.        Can I get pregnant even if my partner pulls out correctly?    Even if you trust your partner to perform the pull out method correctly, any time that sperm are allowed to enter the vagina there is a chance that a pregnancy could result. Sperm can be viable for a short period of 6 hours outside the male body, for example on hands. Once the sperm have been transferred into the woman, through foreplay or other means, it is possible for them to reach the uterus if they are aided by the female’s bodily fluids. It can also happen more easily if sperm left in the urethra from a previous ejaculation are expelled into the female with pre-ejaculate fluids.        MORE QUESTIONS?

The BabyCenter Editorial Team          Mom Answers ( 84 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   At least that&#39;s what the doctors say. In reality you can get pregnant any time of your menstrual cycle. And not nessesarily when you&#39;re ovulating. But I know a person who can tell you for shure will you get pregnant or not and when just by looking at your photo. It&#39;s very easy to find him. Just go on facebook and search for this group. The name of this group is Baby gender by parents photo                 elliejankins    Answered 10/11/16                202 found this helpful     The time when you are ovulating is the best possible change to conceive, but keep in mind that everything has to be just right in order to actually get pregnant. A lot of times the sperm and the egg meet and the beginnings of an embryo will start, but implantation never occurs and you would have a normal period and no pregnancy. And there are a significant number of &quot;pregnancies&quot; that implant and then spontaneously miscarry long before you would know you were pregnant and you'd have a normal period. The static is that if you and your are healthy and have intercourse on the exact day that you ovulate there is a 1 in 4 chance of getting pregnant (and detecting it). Also keep in mind that sperm can live in the vagina for approx 3-7 days, so it is possible to get pregnant from sex either a few days before or a few days after ovulation.                 LMGJackson    Answered 11/30/07               194 found this helpful     it isnt a sure thing but it is VERY possible. If a sperm fertilizes and egg but then doesnt attach to the uterine wall then you will not get pregnant. the egg will just pass out during your next period.              Anonymous   Answered 9/14/07               138 found this helpful     Like others have posted...that is the BEST time for getting pregnant, but I do know someone who did the ovulation kits, knew she was ovulating and still didn't get pregnant. I know she eventually did, but without being checked by a doctor you don't really know why you aren't getting pregnant. It could be lots of things including stress or a low sperm count.              Anonymous   Answered 11/8/07               87 found this helpful     It is the most likely time to get pregnant when you are ovulating. However sperm can live up to 7 days inside your vagina. If you are trying to get pregnant, just make an appointment with your Gynecologist for the best advice. If you are trying to NOT get pregnant use birth control and/or get yourself to planned parenthood.                 gratefulbeauty    Answered 11/26/07               60 found this helpful     the doctors say that the best and more effective way to concieve a baby but it happens when the time is right. for one whole year after i was married both me and my husband tried for a baby and i went by an ovulation calculator to have intercourse and nothing happend then march came and i lost track of the calculater and in may i found out i was 6 weeks preggers              Anonymous   Answered 11/6/07               57 found this helpful     it also depends on if your body is ready              Anonymous   Answered 9/27/07               55 found this helpful     No it is NOT a sure thing! my DH and I had sex one month every other day during ovulation and NOTHING so then we tried EVERYDAY during ovulation and NOTHING. the one time we only had sex ONCE is when we got pregnant.

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Here, we answer some common conception questions to help increase your chances of getting pregnant. By K. Aleisha Fetters  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Phillip Graybill  Q: Will having an orgasm help me get pregnant? A: Yes! Yes! Yes! Some experts believe that uterine contractions during orgasm may help propel sperm into the cervix, but one thing is for sure -- the tingles (and flood of oxytocin) during orgasm definitely make you relaxed. And that means you've already cleared the biggest baby-making blocker: stress. "The better the sex, the better the chances of conception," says reproductive physiologist Joanna Ellington, Ph.D., in the British documentary The Great Sperm Race . Men who are fully stimulated will ejaculate up to 50 percent more, according to research revealed in the program. "So if you have what I call 'gourmet sex,' where you really spend time and you make it fun for both partners, that is going to make the man more stimulated and he is going to ejaculate more and healthier sperm," she says. Sure, plain old sex, with no female orgasm, can result in a baby, too, but why not go for the gold? Q: Can we determine the sex of our baby? A: Depends on whom you ask. Proponents of the Shettles Method, which was developed in the 1960s, claim a 75- to 90-percent success rate in determining their babies' gender. The Shettles Method is based on the belief that sperm with Y chromosomes (which produce boys) move faster than sperm with X chromosomes (which produce girls) and it is possible that alkaline secretions in the vaginal tract, caused by female orgasm, favor Y chromosomal sperm. Still, there's no "convincing evidence" that sexual techniques can determine gender, according to Optimizing natural fertility . So if your hubby really wants to get out the ol' toy trucks again, opting for in vitro is his best bet, says Melissa M. Goist, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Do Sex Positions Matter? Q: Do certain sex positions help my chances of conceiving? A: Common sense says that deep penetration (through positions like rear-entry and missionary) will dispense sperm closer to the cervix, helping the little swimmers reach their goal, but there's no evidence to back up the theory. Regardless of how you get down to business, sperm are present in the cervical canal just seconds after ejaculation, according to Optimizing natural fertility , a committee opinion by the Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. That means your favorite position is the best one for conceiving, says Shari Brasner, M.D., ob-gyn at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital. "There is no rationale for sex to be uncomfortable or awkward." Q: Can oral sex as foreplay hurt our chances of conceiving? A: Not to be a foreplay killer, but saliva can be a sperm killer. It can interfere with your cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract (making it inhospitable to sperm), and even take out stalwart swimmers, according to Optimizing natural fertility. If clitoral stimulation helps get you in the mood, ask your man to reach for fertility-safe lubricant and put his fingers to work instead. Being face-to-face--and mouth-to-mouth--during the act might even be more intimate. Q: Is hot tub sex a bad idea when trying to conceive? A: Yes. Hot tubs are typically factory programmed at 104?. At that temp (some like it hotter!) it takes only 10 to 20 minutes to raise the temperature of your body, his body, and his testicles to 102? or higher, according to the American Pregnancy Association. And his boys don't like getting any warmer than 96? if they can help it. Not only can sperm cells sizzle in the heat, the production of them can temporarily screech to a halt--decreasing his sperm count for days. Can You Give Sperm an Advantage? Q: Can gravity help sperm work their magic? A: Probably not. Some women think that lying on your back with your hips elevated for 20 minutes after sex will help ensure that every last sperm gets a fighting chance at the prize, but the belief has no scientific foundation, according to Optimizing natural fertility . It can't hurt, though, Dr. Goist says. So why not use the technique as an excuse to get your post-romp cuddle on? Q: Will lubricants help his sperm reach my egg? A: Nope. Your cervical mucus moves sperm along quite swimmingly all on its own. Plus, most lubricants can interfere with cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract, and kill off even the sturdiest of sperm. In fact, water-based lubricants (like Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60 percent to 100 percent within 60 minutes of incubation, according to a study published in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies . If you really need some extra lubrication during sex (a common issue when you're more focused on making babies than making love), sticking with mineral oil, canola oil, or a hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricant such as Pre-Seed are your best bets, Dr. Brasner says. Timing it Right Q: Is there an ideal time of day to have sex to conceive? A: Sure is. It's in the morning. Or, specifically, after your man gets a good night's rest, says Dr. Goist. When he's sleeping, his body regenerates the sperm lost during the day. Although the average sperm cell has a pretty short shelf life--only seven days--even stalwart swimmers can hit their expiration date early if they get too warm from exercise like bike riding, Dr. Goist says. Q: Should we "save" his sperm for when I'm ovulating? A: No! If your man has been stepping up on cold showers to store his swimmers until your ovulation test turns positive, it's time to turn the heat back up. As long as your partner has a normal sperm count, you'll have the best shot of conceiving if you have sex once a day, according to Optimizing natural fertility . Abstaining can increase sperm count (a good thing in that more boys start the trip), but it can also decrease sperm motility (a bad thing if you don't want them to just chase their tails). Moreover, abstinence intervals greater than five days can diminish sperm counts. Don't forget: Most (but certainly not all!) pregnancies occur during the two days before ovulation, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction .

Sex! (Or intercourse at the right time, to be technical about it.)  The 'fertile window' is when you should be having lots of sex if you want to conceive.  The fertile window  We’re talking about the days in a woman’s menstrual cycle when pregnancy is possible. The ‘fertile window’ depends on the length of a woman’s cycle, this varies between women.  Pregnancy is technically only possible during the five days before ovulation through to the day of ovulation. These six days are the ‘fertile window’ in a woman’s cycle, and reflect the lifespan of sperm (5 days) and the lifespan of the ovum (24 hours).  Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary, moves down the fallopian tube, and is available in the fallopian tube to be fertilised. If there is sperm waiting around at the time the egg is released, there is a higher chance that it will be fertilised. Ovulation happens about two weeks before the woman’s next expected period. So if her average menstrual cycle is 28 days, ovulation will happen around day 14.  If sex is timed five days before a woman’s ovulation, the probability of her getting pregnant is about 10%. The probability of pregnancy rises steadily until the two days before and including the day of ovulation. The likelihood of conceiving is dramatically increased if intercourse occurs in the three days leading up to and including ovulation.  At the end of a woman’s ‘fertile window’, the probability of pregnancy declines rapidly and by 12-24 hours after she ovulates, a woman is no longer able to get pregnant during that cycle.  Too complicated?  If your partner is not aware of her ‘fertile window’ or when she ovulates, she can find more information here . Otherwise, to cover all bases, sexual intercourse is recommended every 2 to 3 days to help optimise your chance of conceiving. But there’s no limit to how much sex you can have during that 6-day period.  The likelihood of actually becoming pregnant is dramatically increased if you have intercourse in the three days leading up to and including ovulation. If sex is timed well on any of these three days, she has a 27-33% chance of becoming pregnant. Adapted from data by Wilcox, A.J. et al. NEJM (1995) 333:1517 Myth conception The myth: "A woman can get pregnant any time of the month." The truth: The only time a woman can conceive is during the ‘fertile window’ of the menstrual cycle.  The ’fertile window’ in the menstrual cycle is the six days leading up to ovulation, when the egg is released from the ovary. This depends on how long the woman’s menstrual cycles are.  Not all women have the same length of cycle. If, on average, your partner has a period every 28 days the best chance of conceiving is between days 12 and 14 (with ovulation day on day 14). If she has a 24 -day cycle, then focus your efforts between days 7 and 10.

Health Sciences    August 23, 2017               Priya's popular Ebook, "How Not To Waste Another Month When Trying To Conceive," features a chapter titled: The Statistics Behind Getting Pregnant . This post will share information from that chapter and explain how to apply the data in order to give you scientifically backed education on conception.  How Many Fertile Days Per Month: Technically there are only 6 days a month that you are able to get pregnant, which is referred to as your fertile window. These 6 days include the 5 days before ovulation and the day of ovulation. The number, however, depends on how long your partner’s sperm can live and how long your egg can live. Eggs typically live anywhere from 12-24 hours and sperm typically lives anywhere from 2-7 days. If his sperm lives 7 days, then you will have 8 days a month to get pregnant but if his sperm lives 3 days, than you have 4 days a month that you are able to conceive.        Adapted from Wilcox, AJ. et al. NEJM (1998) 394-397.     The graph above show the percent chance of getting pregnant during certain days of your cycle. NOTE: Six days before you ovulate and the day after you ovulate you may have a 0% chance of getting pregnant! How To Maximize Your Chance Of Getting Pregnant: So how do you put these statistics to work? The key to maximizing your chances of getting pregnant each month is to find your fertile window. Having sperm waiting around to greet your egg increases your chance of getting pregnant. Aim to have intercourse every day (or every other day), starting two to four days before you expect to ovulate and then the day of ovulation. NOTE: Most men don’t have to worry about having too much sex for sperm count: You should not limit sex unless there is a medical reason. Ask your doctor about the new research on low sperm count and frequency of intercourse. Some research is showing more sex actually increases chances of conception for men with low sperm count rather than skipping days. During your non-fertile days, try and keep sex romantic and spontaneous to prevent burnout and unnecessary stress.  Probability Of Getting Pregnant By Age:        Optimizing Natural Fertility. Fertil Steril 2008; 90:S1-6.     Age is a factor in how long it may take you to get pregnant and also a factor in how long you should try before you seek out professional help. As you get older, it is harder to get pregnant and harder to stay pregnant, that is, the risk of miscarriage increases. If you are 35 or older, that does not mean you won’t get pregnant, it just means you may need to be more patient with the process. If you are 35 or older you should try for 6 months before seeking fertile assistance and for up to a year if you are under 35 years of age. Here is your likelihood in a year or within 4 years (source) : 30 years: 75% in 1 year, 91% within 4 years 35 years: 66% in 1 year, 84% within 4 years 40 years: 44% in 1 year, 64% within 4 years  The takeaway from these statistics are to show you how important it is to have sex during your fertile window and also give some indication of how long it may take you to get pregnant. If you are in your late 30s don’t allow for the news and media to scare you into thinking it’s too late. It’s true that you probably don’t have as many good eggs as you did in your 20s. In your 20s you may have had 12 good eggs in a year and now you may have 4 good eggs in a year. That is why it may take longer and why timing is crucial, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have passed your biological age for fertility. If you have passed your biological age for fertility, talk to your doctor about other options for becoming a parent if that is still what you desire. NOTE: You also don't need to wait 6 or 12 months before talking to your doctor. A pre-conception visit is a great idea and can help to answer any questions or concerns you may have as well as help to prevent risks that can arise once you do become pregnant.

facts Alex Brooks | July 23, 2015 Fertility and trying to conceive isn't as easy as some people think. 7 surprising fertility facts 00:18:37 Fertility and trying to conceive isn?t as easy as some people think, here are some facts that might surprise you! 29 May 2017 11 months /video/video.kidspot.com.au/Birth/  Fertility and conception experts like Medica IVF's Dr David Knight say the human species is not as fertile as we like to think. "If you are between 18 and 34 and you and your partner are generally healthy, doctors say more often than not some simple problems - with easy fixes - may be standing in your way," he says. There are plenty of myths and old wives tales about fertility that Dr Knight says can get in the way of successfully falling pregnant. Fertility fact 1: How often to have sex Most women know they must ovulate in order to conceive, but having sex on the day of ovulation does not increase the chances of conception. It may in fact decrease a woman's chance as many wait for ovulation before having sex which may cause them to bypass their most fertile time. After ovulation, an egg is only viable for about 24 hours, so if you are waiting until you ovulate to have intercourse, chances are you are going to miss the opportunity to get pregnant that month. Since sperm can also live in your reproductive tract for 3-4 days, having sex two to three times a week, means that when an egg is released there will be sperm waiting! "I tell my patients to have regular intercourse, meaning 2-3 times a week generally starting after your period stops. Specifically I encourage couples NOT to monitor ovulation or use temperature graphs," Dr Knight says. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that having sex beginning six days prior to ovulation is the most conducive to achieving conception. The more times you have intercourse during your 'window of opportunity', the more likely you are to get pregnant.  Source: iStock  Fertility fact 2: Relax, have sex every day Don't worry about having too much sex when you are trying to conceive. The same NEJM study found that having sex every day is slightly more likely to result in pregnancy than intercourse every other day. Experts do caution couples not to put love making on a schedule. That, they say, just might decrease chances of conception. The scientific evidence is scarce, but if you are stressed and love making is on 'schedule',' there is some data to show that hormones may be affected and that in turn could influence conception. A Harvard Medical School study on women with fertility problems, that 55% of those who completed a 10-week course of relaxation training and stress reduction had a viable pregnancy within one year, compared with just 20% of the group who had no stress reduction training. Doctors have also found that women undergoing fertility treatments , who remained relaxed and optimistic, had better overall outcomes than women who were pessimistic about their ability to conceive. If you are worried all the time about getting pregnant, if you obsess over it and think about only that, you might influence your body chemistry in a way that does affect your fertility. The key is to "think about making love, not about making babies." Fertility fact 3: How position affects conception There are many myths surrounding sexual intercourse and the best time to conceive. Many couples widely believe that the position taken during sexual intercourse will affect their chances of getting pregnant. Furthermore, many believe their chances of conceiving are increased by lying on their backs for 20 minutes, ensuring the semen stays in the neck of the uterus for longer. Whilst semen does inevitably come out of the vagina following ejaculation, sufficient sperm are deposited in the neck of the womb and are able to begin their journey towards the egg, regardless of the position taken.  Source: iStock  Fertility fact 4: Don't think sperm potency improves by saving up Millions of sperm are produced every day in the testicles. The sperm are stored in a tiny sac, the epididymis, which lies at the top of each testicle. Abstaining from sex in order to accumulate sperm so that more are deposited during sex will not increase your chances of achieving conception. In fact the stored, older sperm may be of inferior quality and even hinder the newly produced, healthier sperm from reaching the egg. Fertility fact 5: Lubricant won't help sperm to slip, slide and get inside Not only is this not true, it could actually prevent you from getting pregnant, says Dr Knight.Most lubricants change the pH or acid balance inside the vagina, and that in turn may affect sperm motility and ultimately prevent, or at least reduce the chances of a pregnancy occurring. If you find you must use a lubricant avoid petroleum jelly. Instead try natural vegetable products, such as olive oil, which is less likely to cause sperm any serious problems.  11 Apr 2018  Fertility fact 6: Just because the female doesn't orgasm, doesn't matter There is no evidence to support that a woman with low libido or failure to orgasm cannot conceive - though some patients do think this. Furthermore, a woman does not need to achieve an orgasm in order to conceive. Continually trying to find the right time to have sexual intercourse may place a strain on a couple's lovemaking and this in turn may hinder their chances of getting pregnant. Couples should have sexual intercourse when they feel like it and not limit it to the period during the woman's cycle perceived to be the most fertile. Furthermore, women do not always ovulate on the fourteenth day of their cycle and it is easy to misjudge the fertile time. The chance of becoming pregnant in any one month for a fertile couple is at best 25 per cent and even in entirely healthy couples. Fertility fact 7: Failing to conceive doesn't mean you are a failure Infertility is a medical condition just like arthritis or asthma, which can require medical treatment. It is no reflection on how masculine or feminine a person is. Although there are no dietary or nutritional cures for infertility, a healthy lifestyle is important. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, not smoking and avoiding alcohol and caffeine are probably wise ideas.

Can I get pregnant 3, 4 or 5 days before ovulation?    In Blog , Ovulation             Tweet     Pin It     How likely are you to get pregnant if your last intercourse was 3, 4 or even 5 days before ovulation?  You probably know that natural conception must take place immediately after ovulation . When a mature egg cell is released from one of your ovaries, it must be fertilized within 24 hours, perhaps even less. If it isn’t, it dies, and your chances of pregnancy are lost in that cycle.  However, sperm cells can survive inside your body for several days and still be able to fertilize the egg. Therefore, it is possible to get pregnant from intercourse that took place a few days before ovulation.  Your chances of becoming pregnant are definitely highest when you are able to have intercourse right before ovulation. But unfortunately, perfect timing isn’t always possible.  So what are your actual chances to conceive, if your last intercourse was three or more days before ovulation?  About the fertile window  The fertile window , or your fertile period, is made up of those days in your cycle when pregnancy is possible.  According to FertilityFriend.com , a fertility charting service, the theoretical fertile window is six days long: The five days before ovulation plus the day of ovulation itself.   In a textbook 28-day cycle with ovulation on cycle day 14, the fertile window would therefore span from day 9 to day 14 of the cycle. Intercourse on any of these days could result in pregnancy.  However, your chances of conceiving are far from equal on each of these days.  In an analysis of more than 100,000 fertility charts on their website, FertilityFriend.com found that 94% of women who became pregnant had intercourse on at least one of the last two days before ovulation, or on the ovulation day itself.  To optimize your chances of conceiving, FertilityFriend.com therefore recommends having intercourse during a three-day fertile window, which includes your ovulation day and the two previous days.  That being said: If the charts that were analyzed had mostly accurate information about intercourse patterns, 6% of the pregnancies resulted from intercourse three or more days before ovulation .  That’s a modest probability, but it’s not nonexistent.  Intercourse timing and chances of conception  Several teams of medical researchers have studied the relationship between intercourse timing and chances of conception.  In one study from 2000, published in Demographic Research , B. Colombo and G. Masarotto included a comparison of the results of previous studies (see table below).  In most cases, Day 0 (the “reference day”) corresponds to the last day with a low basal body temperature . This is the most likely ovulation day. Day -5 therefore means five days before ovulation, -4 means four days before ovulation and so forth.  Days  Schwartz et al (1979)  Schwartz, MacDonald & Heuchel (1980)  Bremme (1981)  Weinberg et al (1998)  Wilcox, Weinberg & Baird (1998)  Colombo & Masarotto (2000)  -8       0.3%  -7    < 0.5%    1%  -6    2%    3%  -5   4%  8%  10%  4%  7%  -4  8%  14%  10%  16%  13%  18%  -3  20%  20%  15%  14%  8%  24%  -2  13%  20%  24%  27%  29%  26%  -1  21%  34%  27%  31%  27%  21%  0  15%  14%  33%  33%  8%  10%  1  11%  7%  7%    1%  2  9%      4%  It won’t be a surprise that all the studies showed the best chances of conception when intercourse took place on the day of ovulation and the two previous days (days 0, -1 and -2).  But some studies found conception rates as high as 14-16% from intercourse four days before ovulation , and up to 10% five days before ovulation . Even intercourse as much as six or seven days before ovulation was reported to have resulted in pregnancy!  Other fertility factors matter  Do keep in mind that these figures are statistical averages in large study populations. Your and your partner’s age, health, intercourse frequency, and many other factors may give you better or poorer odds than these averages.  As an example, consider the following graph from an analysis of the data from the Colombo and Masarotto study, published in Human Reproduction (Oxford Journals) . Here, the woman’s age is taken into account:   For all age groups, intercourse two days before ovulation gave the highest success rates. But among those who had intercourse on that specific day, women aged 19-26 were almost twice as likely to conceive as women aged 35-39.  Conclusion  If your last intercourse in this cycle was 3, 4 or 5 days before ovulation, don’t give up hope quite yet – but don’t get your hopes up too much either. Pregnancy is possible, but not likely. And in future cycles, having intercourse closer to ovulation will greatly increase your chances of getting pregnant.

Sex! (Or intercourse at the right time, to be technical about it.)  The 'fertile window' is when you should be having lots of sex if you want to conceive.  The fertile window  We’re talking about the days in a woman’s menstrual cycle when pregnancy is possible. The ‘fertile window’ depends on the length of a woman’s cycle, this varies between women.  Pregnancy is technically only possible during the five days before ovulation through to the day of ovulation. These six days are the ‘fertile window’ in a woman’s cycle, and reflect the lifespan of sperm (5 days) and the lifespan of the ovum (24 hours).  Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary, moves down the fallopian tube, and is available in the fallopian tube to be fertilised. If there is sperm waiting around at the time the egg is released, there is a higher chance that it will be fertilised. Ovulation happens about two weeks before the woman’s next expected period. So if her average menstrual cycle is 28 days, ovulation will happen around day 14.  If sex is timed five days before a woman’s ovulation, the probability of her getting pregnant is about 10%. The probability of pregnancy rises steadily until the two days before and including the day of ovulation. The likelihood of conceiving is dramatically increased if intercourse occurs in the three days leading up to and including ovulation.  At the end of a woman’s ‘fertile window’, the probability of pregnancy declines rapidly and by 12-24 hours after she ovulates, a woman is no longer able to get pregnant during that cycle.  Too complicated?  If your partner is not aware of her ‘fertile window’ or when she ovulates, she can find more information here . Otherwise, to cover all bases, sexual intercourse is recommended every 2 to 3 days to help optimise your chance of conceiving. But there’s no limit to how much sex you can have during that 6-day period.  The likelihood of actually becoming pregnant is dramatically increased if you have intercourse in the three days leading up to and including ovulation. If sex is timed well on any of these three days, she has a 27-33% chance of becoming pregnant. Adapted from data by Wilcox, A.J. et al. NEJM (1995) 333:1517 Myth conception The myth: "A woman can get pregnant any time of the month." The truth: The only time a woman can conceive is during the ‘fertile window’ of the menstrual cycle.  The ’fertile window’ in the menstrual cycle is the six days leading up to ovulation, when the egg is released from the ovary. This depends on how long the woman’s menstrual cycles are.  Not all women have the same length of cycle. If, on average, your partner has a period every 28 days the best chance of conceiving is between days 12 and 14 (with ovulation day on day 14). If she has a 24 -day cycle, then focus your efforts between days 7 and 10.

REGIMEN   EVERY  TIME     Info       Withdrawal Method  Do it properly.  The withdrawal method must be used, before your partner ejaculates, every single time you have
					sex. It’s extremely unreliable and only limits the chances of any sperm reaching the egg.

Withdrawal is also called coitus interruptus or the "pull out method" and it requires great self-control, experience, and trust, and as such, it is pretty unreliable. It works, some of the time, by the man taking his penis out of the vagina before he ejaculates, limiting the chances of any sperm reaching the egg. However, not all sperm are released at climax, some are a little more eager than that, so even though you don’t finish off, you could still finish up pregnant.                            HOW TO  The Withdrawal Method really isn’t rocket science, the man withdraws from inside you before climax to minimize the risk of sperm entering the vagina and therefore reaching the egg. The key word is minimize, sperm still escape, and escaped sperm can still fertilize eggs. Men who use the withdrawal method must be able to know when they are reaching the point in sexual excitement when ejaculation can no longer be stopped or postponed. If you cannot predict this moment accurately, withdrawal will not be as effective. Even if a man pulls out in time, pregnancy can still happen. Some experts believe that pre-ejaculate, or pre-cum, can pick up enough sperm left in the urethra from a previous ejaculation to cause pregnancy. This is not a method that would be recommended by healthcare providers, or by the millions of people who tried it, put an early stop to the fun, and got unplanned pregnant anyway.              PROS AND CONS    It isn’t affected by other medications  It can be used when breastfeeding  Hormone free      It’s extremely unreliable  It interrupts sex  Does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS       Are any sexual positions better than others when using the withdrawal method?    Withdrawal is also called coitus interruptus or the "pull out method" and it requires great self-control, experience, and trust, and as such, it is pretty unreliable. It works, some of the time, by taking the penis out of the vagina before you ejaculate, limiting the chances of any sperm reaching the egg. With each ejaculation you are releasing up to 400 Million sperms. However, not all sperm are released at climax, some are a little more eager than that and can survive inside a woman`s uterus for up to five days, so even though you don’t finish off, you could still finish up making her pregnant.        Will douching help to prevent pregnancy after coitus interruptus?    No not all, however it is far better to bathe and make sure that anything with ejaculate on it does not get near the vagina within one to six hours, their known lifespan outside the body.            Will the withdrawal method work even when ovulating?    Since a woman is most fertile in the few days prior to or after ovulation, it is never suggested that she have sexual intercourse during that time if she does not wish to get pregnant. Even the most foolproof methods of contraception do have a miniscule failure rate and as the withdrawal method is only 78% successful, it would be best to avoid having sexual relations during this time.        How effective is the withdrawal method?    Withdrawal is less effective than most other contraceptive methods. As commonly used, it is only 78 percent effective, meaning that 22 of every 100 women whose partners use withdrawal will become pregnant over a year.            Can everybody use the withdrawal method?    Withdrawal requires men to have good self-control. A man must be able and willing to withdraw the penis and ejaculate outside the woman’s body. If he does not withdraw before ejaculating, his partner may become pregnant. Also, a small amount of semen may be released into the vagina before the full ejaculation, possibly without the man realizing it. Even this small amount of semen may contain enough sperm to possibly cause a pregnancy and to transmit STIs/HIV.        Can I get pregnant even if my partner pulls out correctly?    Even if you trust your partner to perform the pull out method correctly, any time that sperm are allowed to enter the vagina there is a chance that a pregnancy could result. Sperm can be viable for a short period of 6 hours outside the male body, for example on hands. Once the sperm have been transferred into the woman, through foreplay or other means, it is possible for them to reach the uterus if they are aided by the female’s bodily fluids. It can also happen more easily if sperm left in the urethra from a previous ejaculation are expelled into the female with pre-ejaculate fluids.        MORE QUESTIONS?

In reality you can get pregnant any time of your menstrual cycle. And not nessesarily when you&#39;re ovulating. But I know a person who can tell you for shure will you get pregnant or not and when just by looking at your photo. It&#39;s very easy to find him. Just go on facebook and search for this group. The name of this group is Baby gender by parents photo                 elliejankins    Answered 10/11/16                202 found this helpful     The time when you are ovulating is the best possible change to conceive, but keep in mind that everything has to be just right in order to actually get pregnant. A lot of times the sperm and the egg meet and the beginnings of an embryo will start, but implantation never occurs and you would have a normal period and no pregnancy. And there are a significant number of &quot;pregnancies&quot; that implant and then spontaneously miscarry long before you would know you were pregnant and you'd have a normal period. The static is that if you and your are healthy and have intercourse on the exact day that you ovulate there is a 1 in 4 chance of getting pregnant (and detecting it). Also keep in mind that sperm can live in the vagina for approx 3-7 days, so it is possible to get pregnant from sex either a few days before or a few days after ovulation.                 LMGJackson    Answered 11/30/07               194 found this helpful     it isnt a sure thing but it is VERY possible. If a sperm fertilizes and egg but then doesnt attach to the uterine wall then you will not get pregnant. the egg will just pass out during your next period.              Anonymous   Answered 9/14/07               138 found this helpful     Like others have posted...that is the BEST time for getting pregnant, but I do know someone who did the ovulation kits, knew she was ovulating and still didn't get pregnant. I know she eventually did, but without being checked by a doctor you don't really know why you aren't getting pregnant. It could be lots of things including stress or a low sperm count.              Anonymous   Answered 11/8/07               87 found this helpful     It is the most likely time to get pregnant when you are ovulating. However sperm can live up to 7 days inside your vagina. If you are trying to get pregnant, just make an appointment with your Gynecologist for the best advice. If you are trying to NOT get pregnant use birth control and/or get yourself to planned parenthood.                 gratefulbeauty    Answered 11/26/07               60 found this helpful     the doctors say that the best and more effective way to concieve a baby but it happens when the time is right. for one whole year after i was married both me and my husband tried for a baby and i went by an ovulation calculator to have intercourse and nothing happend then march came and i lost track of the calculater and in may i found out i was 6 weeks preggers              Anonymous   Answered 11/6/07               57 found this helpful     it also depends on if your body is ready              Anonymous   Answered 9/27/07               55 found this helpful     No it is NOT a sure thing! my DH and I had sex one month every other day during ovulation and NOTHING so then we tried EVERYDAY during ovulation and NOTHING. the one time we only had sex ONCE is when we got pregnant.

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Here, we answer some common conception questions to help increase your chances of getting pregnant. By K. Aleisha Fetters  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Phillip Graybill  Q: Will having an orgasm help me get pregnant? A: Yes! Yes! Yes! Some experts believe that uterine contractions during orgasm may help propel sperm into the cervix, but one thing is for sure -- the tingles (and flood of oxytocin) during orgasm definitely make you relaxed. And that means you've already cleared the biggest baby-making blocker: stress. "The better the sex, the better the chances of conception," says reproductive physiologist Joanna Ellington, Ph.D., in the British documentary The Great Sperm Race . Men who are fully stimulated will ejaculate up to 50 percent more, according to research revealed in the program. "So if you have what I call 'gourmet sex,' where you really spend time and you make it fun for both partners, that is going to make the man more stimulated and he is going to ejaculate more and healthier sperm," she says. Sure, plain old sex, with no female orgasm, can result in a baby, too, but why not go for the gold? Q: Can we determine the sex of our baby? A: Depends on whom you ask. Proponents of the Shettles Method, which was developed in the 1960s, claim a 75- to 90-percent success rate in determining their babies' gender. The Shettles Method is based on the belief that sperm with Y chromosomes (which produce boys) move faster than sperm with X chromosomes (which produce girls) and it is possible that alkaline secretions in the vaginal tract, caused by female orgasm, favor Y chromosomal sperm. Still, there's no "convincing evidence" that sexual techniques can determine gender, according to Optimizing natural fertility . So if your hubby really wants to get out the ol' toy trucks again, opting for in vitro is his best bet, says Melissa M. Goist, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Do Sex Positions Matter? Q: Do certain sex positions help my chances of conceiving? A: Common sense says that deep penetration (through positions like rear-entry and missionary) will dispense sperm closer to the cervix, helping the little swimmers reach their goal, but there's no evidence to back up the theory. Regardless of how you get down to business, sperm are present in the cervical canal just seconds after ejaculation, according to Optimizing natural fertility , a committee opinion by the Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. That means your favorite position is the best one for conceiving, says Shari Brasner, M.D., ob-gyn at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital. "There is no rationale for sex to be uncomfortable or awkward." Q: Can oral sex as foreplay hurt our chances of conceiving? A: Not to be a foreplay killer, but saliva can be a sperm killer. It can interfere with your cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract (making it inhospitable to sperm), and even take out stalwart swimmers, according to Optimizing natural fertility. If clitoral stimulation helps get you in the mood, ask your man to reach for fertility-safe lubricant and put his fingers to work instead. Being face-to-face--and mouth-to-mouth--during the act might even be more intimate. Q: Is hot tub sex a bad idea when trying to conceive? A: Yes. Hot tubs are typically factory programmed at 104?. At that temp (some like it hotter!) it takes only 10 to 20 minutes to raise the temperature of your body, his body, and his testicles to 102? or higher, according to the American Pregnancy Association. And his boys don't like getting any warmer than 96? if they can help it. Not only can sperm cells sizzle in the heat, the production of them can temporarily screech to a halt--decreasing his sperm count for days. Can You Give Sperm an Advantage? Q: Can gravity help sperm work their magic? A: Probably not. Some women think that lying on your back with your hips elevated for 20 minutes after sex will help ensure that every last sperm gets a fighting chance at the prize, but the belief has no scientific foundation, according to Optimizing natural fertility . It can't hurt, though, Dr. Goist says. So why not use the technique as an excuse to get your post-romp cuddle on? Q: Will lubricants help his sperm reach my egg? A: Nope. Your cervical mucus moves sperm along quite swimmingly all on its own. Plus, most lubricants can interfere with cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract, and kill off even the sturdiest of sperm. In fact, water-based lubricants (like Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60 percent to 100 percent within 60 minutes of incubation, according to a study published in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies . If you really need some extra lubrication during sex (a common issue when you're more focused on making babies than making love), sticking with mineral oil, canola oil, or a hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricant such as Pre-Seed are your best bets, Dr. Brasner says. Timing it Right Q: Is there an ideal time of day to have sex to conceive? A: Sure is. It's in the morning. Or, specifically, after your man gets a good night's rest, says Dr. Goist. When he's sleeping, his body regenerates the sperm lost during the day. Although the average sperm cell has a pretty short shelf life--only seven days--even stalwart swimmers can hit their expiration date early if they get too warm from exercise like bike riding, Dr. Goist says. Q: Should we "save" his sperm for when I'm ovulating? A: No! If your man has been stepping up on cold showers to store his swimmers until your ovulation test turns positive, it's time to turn the heat back up. As long as your partner has a normal sperm count, you'll have the best shot of conceiving if you have sex once a day, according to Optimizing natural fertility . Abstaining can increase sperm count (a good thing in that more boys start the trip), but it can also decrease sperm motility (a bad thing if you don't want them to just chase their tails). Moreover, abstinence intervals greater than five days can diminish sperm counts. Don't forget: Most (but certainly not all!) pregnancies occur during the two days before ovulation, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction .

Sex! (Or intercourse at the right time, to be technical about it.)  The 'fertile window' is when you should be having lots of sex if you want to conceive.  The fertile window  We’re talking about the days in a woman’s menstrual cycle when pregnancy is possible. The ‘fertile window’ depends on the length of a woman’s cycle, this varies between women.  Pregnancy is technically only possible during the five days before ovulation through to the day of ovulation. These six days are the ‘fertile window’ in a woman’s cycle, and reflect the lifespan of sperm (5 days) and the lifespan of the ovum (24 hours).  Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary, moves down the fallopian tube, and is available in the fallopian tube to be fertilised. If there is sperm waiting around at the time the egg is released, there is a higher chance that it will be fertilised. Ovulation happens about two weeks before the woman’s next expected period. So if her average menstrual cycle is 28 days, ovulation will happen around day 14.  If sex is timed five days before a woman’s ovulation, the probability of her getting pregnant is about 10%. The probability of pregnancy rises steadily until the two days before and including the day of ovulation. The likelihood of conceiving is dramatically increased if intercourse occurs in the three days leading up to and including ovulation.  At the end of a woman’s ‘fertile window’, the probability of pregnancy declines rapidly and by 12-24 hours after she ovulates, a woman is no longer able to get pregnant during that cycle.  Too complicated?  If your partner is not aware of her ‘fertile window’ or when she ovulates, she can find more information here . Otherwise, to cover all bases, sexual intercourse is recommended every 2 to 3 days to help optimise your chance of conceiving. But there’s no limit to how much sex you can have during that 6-day period.  The likelihood of actually becoming pregnant is dramatically increased if you have intercourse in the three days leading up to and including ovulation. If sex is timed well on any of these three days, she has a 27-33% chance of becoming pregnant. Adapted from data by Wilcox, A.J. et al. NEJM (1995) 333:1517 Myth conception The myth: "A woman can get pregnant any time of the month." The truth: The only time a woman can conceive is during the ‘fertile window’ of the menstrual cycle.  The ’fertile window’ in the menstrual cycle is the six days leading up to ovulation, when the egg is released from the ovary. This depends on how long the woman’s menstrual cycles are.  Not all women have the same length of cycle. If, on average, your partner has a period every 28 days the best chance of conceiving is between days 12 and 14 (with ovulation day on day 14). If she has a 24 -day cycle, then focus your efforts between days 7 and 10.

Health Sciences    August 23, 2017               Priya's popular Ebook, "How Not To Waste Another Month When Trying To Conceive," features a chapter titled: The Statistics Behind Getting Pregnant . This post will share information from that chapter and explain how to apply the data in order to give you scientifically backed education on conception.  How Many Fertile Days Per Month: Technically there are only 6 days a month that you are able to get pregnant, which is referred to as your fertile window. These 6 days include the 5 days before ovulation and the day of ovulation. The number, however, depends on how long your partner’s sperm can live and how long your egg can live. Eggs typically live anywhere from 12-24 hours and sperm typically lives anywhere from 2-7 days. If his sperm lives 7 days, then you will have 8 days a month to get pregnant but if his sperm lives 3 days, than you have 4 days a month that you are able to conceive.        Adapted from Wilcox, AJ. et al. NEJM (1998) 394-397.     The graph above show the percent chance of getting pregnant during certain days of your cycle. NOTE: Six days before you ovulate and the day after you ovulate you may have a 0% chance of getting pregnant! How To Maximize Your Chance Of Getting Pregnant: So how do you put these statistics to work? The key to maximizing your chances of getting pregnant each month is to find your fertile window. Having sperm waiting around to greet your egg increases your chance of getting pregnant. Aim to have intercourse every day (or every other day), starting two to four days before you expect to ovulate and then the day of ovulation. NOTE: Most men don’t have to worry about having too much sex for sperm count: You should not limit sex unless there is a medical reason. Ask your doctor about the new research on low sperm count and frequency of intercourse. Some research is showing more sex actually increases chances of conception for men with low sperm count rather than skipping days. During your non-fertile days, try and keep sex romantic and spontaneous to prevent burnout and unnecessary stress.  Probability Of Getting Pregnant By Age:        Optimizing Natural Fertility. Fertil Steril 2008; 90:S1-6.     Age is a factor in how long it may take you to get pregnant and also a factor in how long you should try before you seek out professional help. As you get older, it is harder to get pregnant and harder to stay pregnant, that is, the risk of miscarriage increases. If you are 35 or older, that does not mean you won’t get pregnant, it just means you may need to be more patient with the process. If you are 35 or older you should try for 6 months before seeking fertile assistance and for up to a year if you are under 35 years of age. Here is your likelihood in a year or within 4 years (source) : 30 years: 75% in 1 year, 91% within 4 years 35 years: 66% in 1 year, 84% within 4 years 40 years: 44% in 1 year, 64% within 4 years  The takeaway from these statistics are to show you how important it is to have sex during your fertile window and also give some indication of how long it may take you to get pregnant. If you are in your late 30s don’t allow for the news and media to scare you into thinking it’s too late. It’s true that you probably don’t have as many good eggs as you did in your 20s. In your 20s you may have had 12 good eggs in a year and now you may have 4 good eggs in a year. That is why it may take longer and why timing is crucial, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have passed your biological age for fertility. If you have passed your biological age for fertility, talk to your doctor about other options for becoming a parent if that is still what you desire. NOTE: You also don't need to wait 6 or 12 months before talking to your doctor. A pre-conception visit is a great idea and can help to answer any questions or concerns you may have as well as help to prevent risks that can arise once you do become pregnant.

facts Alex Brooks | July 23, 2015 Fertility and trying to conceive isn't as easy as some people think. 7 surprising fertility facts 00:18:37 Fertility and trying to conceive isn?t as easy as some people think, here are some facts that might surprise you! 29 May 2017 11 months /video/video.kidspot.com.au/Birth/  Fertility and conception experts like Medica IVF's Dr David Knight say the human species is not as fertile as we like to think. "If you are between 18 and 34 and you and your partner are generally healthy, doctors say more often than not some simple problems - with easy fixes - may be standing in your way," he says. There are plenty of myths and old wives tales about fertility that Dr Knight says can get in the way of successfully falling pregnant. Fertility fact 1: How often to have sex Most women know they must ovulate in order to conceive, but having sex on the day of ovulation does not increase the chances of conception. It may in fact decrease a woman's chance as many wait for ovulation before having sex which may cause them to bypass their most fertile time. After ovulation, an egg is only viable for about 24 hours, so if you are waiting until you ovulate to have intercourse, chances are you are going to miss the opportunity to get pregnant that month. Since sperm can also live in your reproductive tract for 3-4 days, having sex two to three times a week, means that when an egg is released there will be sperm waiting! "I tell my patients to have regular intercourse, meaning 2-3 times a week generally starting after your period stops. Specifically I encourage couples NOT to monitor ovulation or use temperature graphs," Dr Knight says. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that having sex beginning six days prior to ovulation is the most conducive to achieving conception. The more times you have intercourse during your 'window of opportunity', the more likely you are to get pregnant.

The same NEJM study found that having sex every day is slightly more likely to result in pregnancy than intercourse every other day. Experts do caution couples not to put love making on a schedule. That, they say, just might decrease chances of conception. The scientific evidence is scarce, but if you are stressed and love making is on 'schedule',' there is some data to show that hormones may be affected and that in turn could influence conception. A Harvard Medical School study on women with fertility problems, that 55% of those who completed a 10-week course of relaxation training and stress reduction had a viable pregnancy within one year, compared with just 20% of the group who had no stress reduction training. Doctors have also found that women undergoing fertility treatments , who remained relaxed and optimistic, had better overall outcomes than women who were pessimistic about their ability to conceive. If you are worried all the time about getting pregnant, if you obsess over it and think about only that, you might influence your body chemistry in a way that does affect your fertility. The key is to "think about making love, not about making babies." Fertility fact 3: How position affects conception There are many myths surrounding sexual intercourse and the best time to conceive. Many couples widely believe that the position taken during sexual intercourse will affect their chances of getting pregnant. Furthermore, many believe their chances of conceiving are increased by lying on their backs for 20 minutes, ensuring the semen stays in the neck of the uterus for longer. Whilst semen does inevitably come out of the vagina following ejaculation, sufficient sperm are deposited in the neck of the womb and are able to begin their journey towards the egg, regardless of the position taken.  Source: iStock  Fertility fact 4: Don't think sperm potency improves by saving up Millions of sperm are produced every day in the testicles. The sperm are stored in a tiny sac, the epididymis, which lies at the top of each testicle. Abstaining from sex in order to accumulate sperm so that more are deposited during sex will not increase your chances of achieving conception. In fact the stored, older sperm may be of inferior quality and even hinder the newly produced, healthier sperm from reaching the egg. Fertility fact 5: Lubricant won't help sperm to slip, slide and get inside Not only is this not true, it could actually prevent you from getting pregnant, says Dr Knight.Most lubricants change the pH or acid balance inside the vagina, and that in turn may affect sperm motility and ultimately prevent, or at least reduce the chances of a pregnancy occurring. If you find you must use a lubricant avoid petroleum jelly. Instead try natural vegetable products, such as olive oil, which is less likely to cause sperm any serious problems.  11 Apr 2018  Fertility fact 6: Just because the female doesn't orgasm, doesn't matter There is no evidence to support that a woman with low libido or failure to orgasm cannot conceive - though some patients do think this. Furthermore, a woman does not need to achieve an orgasm in order to conceive. Continually trying to find the right time to have sexual intercourse may place a strain on a couple's lovemaking and this in turn may hinder their chances of getting pregnant. Couples should have sexual intercourse when they feel like it and not limit it to the period during the woman's cycle perceived to be the most fertile. Furthermore, women do not always ovulate on the fourteenth day of their cycle and it is easy to misjudge the fertile time. The chance of becoming pregnant in any one month for a fertile couple is at best 25 per cent and even in entirely healthy couples. Fertility fact 7: Failing to conceive doesn't mean you are a failure Infertility is a medical condition just like arthritis or asthma, which can require medical treatment. It is no reflection on how masculine or feminine a person is. Although there are no dietary or nutritional cures for infertility, a healthy lifestyle is important. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, not smoking and avoiding alcohol and caffeine are probably wise ideas.

Can I get pregnant 3, 4 or 5 days before ovulation?    In Blog , Ovulation             Tweet     Pin It     How likely are you to get pregnant if your last intercourse was 3, 4 or even 5 days before ovulation?  You probably know that natural conception must take place immediately after ovulation . When a mature egg cell is released from one of your ovaries, it must be fertilized within 24 hours, perhaps even less. If it isn’t, it dies, and your chances of pregnancy are lost in that cycle.  However, sperm cells can survive inside your body for several days and still be able to fertilize the egg. Therefore, it is possible to get pregnant from intercourse that took place a few days before ovulation.  Your chances of becoming pregnant are definitely highest when you are able to have intercourse right before ovulation. But unfortunately, perfect timing isn’t always possible.  So what are your actual chances to conceive, if your last intercourse was three or more days before ovulation?  About the fertile window  The fertile window , or your fertile period, is made up of those days in your cycle when pregnancy is possible.  According to FertilityFriend.com , a fertility charting service, the theoretical fertile window is six days long: The five days before ovulation plus the day of ovulation itself.   In a textbook 28-day cycle with ovulation on cycle day 14, the fertile window would therefore span from day 9 to day 14 of the cycle. Intercourse on any of these days could result in pregnancy.  However, your chances of conceiving are far from equal on each of these days.  In an analysis of more than 100,000 fertility charts on their website, FertilityFriend.com found that 94% of women who became pregnant had intercourse on at least one of the last two days before ovulation, or on the ovulation day itself.  To optimize your chances of conceiving, FertilityFriend.com therefore recommends having intercourse during a three-day fertile window, which includes your ovulation day and the two previous days.  That being said: If the charts that were analyzed had mostly accurate information about intercourse patterns, 6% of the pregnancies resulted from intercourse three or more days before ovulation .  That’s a modest probability, but it’s not nonexistent.  Intercourse timing and chances of conception  Several teams of medical researchers have studied the relationship between intercourse timing and chances of conception.  In one study from 2000, published in Demographic Research , B. Colombo and G. Masarotto included a comparison of the results of previous studies (see table below).  In most cases, Day 0 (the “reference day”) corresponds to the last day with a low basal body temperature . This is the most likely ovulation day. Day -5 therefore means five days before ovulation, -4 means four days before ovulation and so forth.  Days  Schwartz et al (1979)  Schwartz, MacDonald & Heuchel (1980)  Bremme (1981)  Weinberg et al (1998)  Wilcox, Weinberg & Baird (1998)  Colombo & Masarotto (2000)  -8       0.3%  -7    < 0.5%    1%  -6    2%    3%  -5   4%  8%  10%  4%  7%  -4  8%  14%  10%  16%  13%  18%  -3  20%  20%  15%  14%  8%  24%  -2  13%  20%  24%  27%  29%  26%  -1  21%  34%  27%  31%  27%  21%  0  15%  14%  33%  33%  8%  10%  1  11%  7%  7%    1%  2  9%      4%  It won’t be a surprise that all the studies showed the best chances of conception when intercourse took place on the day of ovulation and the two previous days (days 0, -1 and -2).  But some studies found conception rates as high as 14-16% from intercourse four days before ovulation , and up to 10% five days before ovulation . Even intercourse as much as six or seven days before ovulation was reported to have resulted in pregnancy!  Other fertility factors matter  Do keep in mind that these figures are statistical averages in large study populations. Your and your partner’s age, health, intercourse frequency, and many other factors may give you better or poorer odds than these averages.  As an example, consider the following graph from an analysis of the data from the Colombo and Masarotto study, published in Human Reproduction (Oxford Journals) . Here, the woman’s age is taken into account:   For all age groups, intercourse two days before ovulation gave the highest success rates. But among those who had intercourse on that specific day, women aged 19-26 were almost twice as likely to conceive as women aged 35-39.  Conclusion  If your last intercourse in this cycle was 3, 4 or 5 days before ovulation, don’t give up hope quite yet – but don’t get your hopes up too much either. Pregnancy is possible, but not likely. And in future cycles, having intercourse closer to ovulation will greatly increase your chances of getting pregnant.     Related Posts       When do I ovulate?
