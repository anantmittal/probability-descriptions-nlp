In grade school, the most popular occupation is a career in professional sports. This aspiration collides with reality in various ways, some funny, some a little depressing and others almost heart-breaking. The reality is that a mere fraction of a percent will have such a career, and among those that do, only a privileged and exceptional few will sustain that career for more than one-to-three years.        The Stats Beginning with the hard stats compiled in 2017 by the National College Athletic Association (NCAA), here are the odds of your kid or anyone's kid making it to the pros. Just to keep it real, anyone who didn't play a sport in high-school has been eliminated:  high-school basketball to college (male): 3.3 percent  high-school  basketball to pros (male): 0.03 percent  high-school basketball to college (female): 3.9 percent  high-school  basketball to pros (female):0.03 percent    The dice have been loaded slightly toward pessimistic outcomes. The stats for basketball players are the worst. But, as you might expect, the stats for pro football outcomes were nearly as bad at 0.08 percent. High-school athletes in other sports weren't that much more likely to make it to the pros either. A male high-school hockey player's chances were only 0.07 percent, for male high-school soccer players the odds were 0.09 percent. Even these somewhat depressing outcomes don't necessarily tell the full story, which is still worse. One reason the stats are more favorable in football than in basketball is that in basketball there isn't a system of farm teams. A lot of high-school baseball players make it to the pros in name only. Most end up making a marginal income in farm clubs, where, according to a 2016 player's suit against Major League Baseball, the average farm club player makes about $4 an hour. Less a Living Than a Taste of a Living Another depressing statistic has to do with how long these big-time sports careers last. Overall, the average professional football player's career in the NFL lasts 3.3 years. Even this doesn't fully reveal the fleetingness of near-fame because a few stars stick around for a long time, especially quarterbacks – possibly because the better a quarterback plays, the less he gets pounded. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde's NFL career, for instance, lasted 21 years. But for really good athletes who are almost exceptional – a player drafted into the NFL in the third round, for instance – fewer than half last five seasons. And for really good athletes who aren't exceptional – an NFL player drafted in the seventh round, for instance – fewer than half make it to the second season. "Only Poor People Buy Lottery Tickets" Whoever first made the often repeated remark about poor people and lottery tickets may have been cynical, but according to The Journal of Gambling Studies, they weren't wrong. From the bottom, you're always looking up. Accordingly, a winning lottery ticket or a child who makes it to the big leagues is a dream that gathers intensity in inverse proportion to income. According to a 2015 poll conducted jointly by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and The Harvard School of Public Health, about a quarter of U.S. parents with high-school children who play a sport hope they'll make it to the pros. But among families with incomes under $50,000, the percentage is nearly 40 percent. The near cruelty of the statistical unlikelihood of the fulfillment of this aspiration to sports wealth and fame is made slightly worse by its effect on parents. Tom Farrey, director of the Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute notes that as parents have become more aware of the long odds against their offspring becoming sports professionals, they don't necessarily steer their kids toward a more likely future. Instead, he says, "A lot of parents today see those odds and say, well, I'd better get started early with my kid."

Plenty of parents dream of their children cashing in on a sports scholarship , but before you get your hopes up  you need to understand the hard realities of winning these awards. Here are eight things that parents and student athletes need to know about these scholarships . 1. The odds of winning a NCAA sports scholarship are miniscule. Only about 2 percent of high school athletes win sports scholarships every year at NCAA colleges and universities. Yes, the odds are that dismal. For those who do snag one, the average scholarship is less than $11,000. 2. Full-ride sports scholarships are scarce. There are only six sports where all the scholarships are full ride . These so-called head-count sports are football, men and women's basketball, and women's gymnastics, volleyball, and tennis. In these Division I sports, athletes receive a full ride or no ride. 3. Scholarships can be dinky. Beyond the head-count sports, all other sports are considered "equivalency" sports. NCAA rules dictate how much money a program, such as lacrosse or track, can spend on scholarships. Coaches can slice and dice these awards as they choose, which can lead to awfully small scholarships. 4. Take flattery with a grain of salt. Coaches may tell teenagers that they have lots of scholarship money to divvy out, but prospects shouldn't assume that they will be the recipients, says Karen Weaver , who is on the sports management faculty at Drexel University . A coach might not know whether he wants a particular athlete until he finds out what other teenagers want to sign on to his team. What really matters is the scholarship amount contained in the school's official athletic grant-in-aid form. "Until you get the grant-in-aid form, it's meaningless," observes Weaver, who is a former national championship Division I field hockey coach. 5. A verbal commitment is meaningless. Weaver has heard of coaches telling athletes as young as seventh-graders that they want them for their team. There is no guarantee that a child who verbally commits to a team will end up on it. A coach can change his mind about a prospect. 6. Playing high-level college sports will be a full-time job. Division I athletes may as well be called full-time employees of their schools because of the long hours they work. According to a NCAA survey last year , playing football required 43.3 hours per week;  college baseball, 42.1 hours; men's basketball, 39.2 hours; and women's basketball, 37.6 hours. Because of the huge time commitment, as well as time
 away from campus, Division I athletes will often not be able to major 
in rigorous disciplines, such as the sciences and engineering. 7. Skip hiring an athletic recruiter. Coaches typically think sports recruiters are pests, says Weaver, who has served as a CBS sports commentator. Coaches don't want recruiters to get in the middle; they prefer direct dealings with the student athletes. 8. Forget about slick videos. Coaches don't want athletes to send lengthy videos. Two or three minutes will usually suffice, Weaver says. And you absolutely don't need to hire a professional to do the filming. Post your action video on YouTube and send coaches the link.

Division I student-athletes continue to outperform their peers in the general student body, when compared using the federal graduation rate.  More student-athletes than ever are earning degrees at Division I schools. The most recent Graduation Success Rate data, collected for student-athletes who entered college in 2007, show 84 percent graduated within six years.  The rate is up 2 percentage points from the class that entered in 2006 and includes gains in virtually every demographic.  “Supporting student-athlete success in the classroom is at the heart of our Association, and today’s announcement shows progress toward that goal that is nothing short of remarkable,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said. “We are delighted to see a record percentage of student-athletes achieve graduation, the ultimate goal of entering college.”  Football student-athletes in the Football Bowl Subdivision graduated at a 75 percent rate, a 4 percentage point increase. African-American Football Bowl Subdivision student-athletes increased their GSR four points.  The overall FBS rate represents an all-time high for the Football Bowl Subdivision.  Among student-athletes in men’s basketball and football, those who entered in 2007 increased their GSR over those who entered in 2006. Those who participate in men’s basketball raised their GSR from 73 to 74 percent, and student-athletes who compete in football at a Football Championship Subdivision school graduated at a 72 percent rate, nearly a three-point increase over the previous year’s entering class.  GSRs increased 3 percent among white male student-athletes and African-American student-athletes of both genders. White female student-athletes earned a 93 percent GSR, up two points from last year.  Since the NCAA began tracking GSR with the class of student-athletes who entered in 1995, the overall rate has increased 10 percentage points, which translates to nearly 14,000 more graduates than if the rate had stayed the same. In that same time period, academic standards for Division I student-athletes improved multiple times, with increases in initial eligibility standards, progress-toward-degree standards and the creation of the Academic Progress Rate, a more real-time mechanism to track a student-athlete’s academic success.  NCAA academic reforms made an impact over the past 13 years: As standards strengthened and the Graduation Success Rate increased, nearly 14,000 more student-athletes graduated from college.  The increase is particularly meaningful to University of Hartford President Walter Harrison, who chaired the Committee on Academic Performance since its inception in 2003.  “If I had to think about what makes me proudest, it’s those students who graduated because of the Academic Performance Program,” Harrison said. “We gave those students an opportunity, and they took advantage of it. By and large, you have so greatly improved your life by having a college degree that for me, that is truly the greatest satisfaction.”  GSR was created in 1995 in response to Division I college and university presidents who wanted a rate that more accurately reflected the mobility of college students than the federal graduation rate.  The GSR formula, intended to be a more complete and accurate look at student-athlete success, removes from the rate student-athletes who leave school while academically eligible and includes student-athletes who transfer to a school after initial enrollment elsewhere. The federal graduation rate, however, remains the only metric that allows comparison between student-athletes and the general student body. Student-athletes who entered college in 2007 earned the highest federal graduation rate ever: 66 percent. That rate is one point higher than the general student-body at Division I schools.  African-American male student-athletes earned a 52 percent federal graduation rate – 11 points higher than the federal graduation rate for African-American men in the overall student body. African-American female student-athletes graduate at 63 percent, a rate 13 points higher than African-American females in the overall student body. Federal rates in men’s basketball and FBS football do lag behind the rates of men in the student body, though African-Americans in those sports complete their degrees at a higher rate than African-American men generally.  Federal rates also provide a longer look at student-athlete academic achievement. They were first collected with the 1984 entering class and have continued to improve over nearly a quarter-century.  The rate for all student-athletes has increased 14 percentage points in that time. The 1984 entering class of FBS football student-athletes graduated at a 47 percent rate according to the federal calculation, compared with 62 percent of the 2007 entering class. Federal graduation rates for African-American student-athletes increased from 35 to 56 percent in that time period, and rates for white student-athletes increased from 59 to 70 percent.  “More student-athletes than ever before are leaving college armed with a degree,” said Kevin Lennon, NCAA vice president for academic and membership affairs. “Our members continue to set higher academic standards, and student-athletes continue to meet them.”      Media Contact Michelle Brutlag Hosick Associate Director of Public and Media Relations NCAA mhosick@ncaa.org       News Graduation Success Rate (GSR) FBS University of Hartford Men's Basketball Football                 Latest News      San Francisco failed to monitor its golf program        Findings for former Louisville program assistant vacated        3 schools honored for community outreach        DI Committee on Academics considers transfer rule changes        DIII member dues increase might take effect this year        2018 AASP Career Development Award recipients named        Villanova’s Matt Kennedy earns Elite 90 award        Soccer referees could start keeping official time        Chattanooga failed to monitor housing for tennis student-athletes        CIAA hosts empowerment symposium          View more >                                   Academics  Championships  Fairness and Integrity  Governance  Health and Safety  Champion Magazine  NCAA Publications  NCAA Hall of Champions  National Letter of Intent  NCAA.com  Committee Zones  Eligibility Center  Elite 90  Media Center  Program Hub                        Privacy/Legal Statement  Terms of Use  Contact Us  NCAA Employment  FAQs        Elite Daily The Statistical Breakdown Of Becoming A Professional Athlete Will Make You Keep Your Day Job By Julian Sonny Feb 26 2014 Share Hate what you do and have a passion for athletics? Well, don't quit your day job; you probably suck at sports. Being a professional athlete is much more than just loving to play the game and trying hard. It requires a level of dedication, sacrifice and discipline that, quite frankly, not too many of us are familiar with. To get the better picture, we've compiled some statistical data that solidify our theory that you will probably never be able to break into the pros. Every year, millions of kids have the same dream to make it to the next level. If you haven't been discovered by now, you should take it as a sign.

They vary between the sports, of course, but according to a new study called “The Odds of Success” by Canadian Casino company Online Casino , they’re pretty very slim.  Ice hockey has the best odds — 1 in 598 for high school athletes — but even that pales in comparison to other things. Like fatal car accidents: People have a 1 in 113 chance of dying in a car crash, according to the study.  Wow, this took a dark turn. Anyway, here’s the infographic:    More Sports!

D., Registered Investment Adv; Updated March 23, 2018      Related Articles   1 [Statistics] | Statistics on People Getting Famous in Acting  2 [Pay Scale] | Pay Scale for a Sports Analyst  3 [Sports Law] | How to Become a Sports Law Paralegal  4 [Sports Management] | Sports Management Careers & Salaries     All over sports-infatuated America kids are explaining to friends and family their plans for the future. In grade school, the most popular occupation is a career in professional sports. This aspiration collides with reality in various ways, some funny, some a little depressing and others almost heart-breaking. The reality is that a mere fraction of a percent will have such a career, and among those that do, only a privileged and exceptional few will sustain that career for more than one-to-three years.        The Stats Beginning with the hard stats compiled in 2017 by the National College Athletic Association (NCAA), here are the odds of your kid or anyone's kid making it to the pros. Just to keep it real, anyone who didn't play a sport in high-school has been eliminated:  high-school basketball to college (male): 3.3 percent  high-school  basketball to pros (male): 0.03 percent  high-school basketball to college (female): 3.9 percent  high-school  basketball to pros (female):0.03 percent    The dice have been loaded slightly toward pessimistic outcomes. The stats for basketball players are the worst. But, as you might expect, the stats for pro football outcomes were nearly as bad at 0.08 percent. High-school athletes in other sports weren't that much more likely to make it to the pros either. A male high-school hockey player's chances were only 0.07 percent, for male high-school soccer players the odds were 0.09 percent. Even these somewhat depressing outcomes don't necessarily tell the full story, which is still worse. One reason the stats are more favorable in football than in basketball is that in basketball there isn't a system of farm teams. A lot of high-school baseball players make it to the pros in name only. Most end up making a marginal income in farm clubs, where, according to a 2016 player's suit against Major League Baseball, the average farm club player makes about $4 an hour. Less a Living Than a Taste of a Living Another depressing statistic has to do with how long these big-time sports careers last. Overall, the average professional football player's career in the NFL lasts 3.3 years. Even this doesn't fully reveal the fleetingness of near-fame because a few stars stick around for a long time, especially quarterbacks – possibly because the better a quarterback plays, the less he gets pounded. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde's NFL career, for instance, lasted 21 years. But for really good athletes who are almost exceptional – a player drafted into the NFL in the third round, for instance – fewer than half last five seasons. And for really good athletes who aren't exceptional – an NFL player drafted in the seventh round, for instance – fewer than half make it to the second season. "Only Poor People Buy Lottery Tickets" Whoever first made the often repeated remark about poor people and lottery tickets may have been cynical, but according to The Journal of Gambling Studies, they weren't wrong. From the bottom, you're always looking up. Accordingly, a winning lottery ticket or a child who makes it to the big leagues is a dream that gathers intensity in inverse proportion to income. According to a 2015 poll conducted jointly by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and The Harvard School of Public Health, about a quarter of U.S. parents with high-school children who play a sport hope they'll make it to the pros. But among families with incomes under $50,000, the percentage is nearly 40 percent. The near cruelty of the statistical unlikelihood of the fulfillment of this aspiration to sports wealth and fame is made slightly worse by its effect on parents. Tom Farrey, director of the Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute notes that as parents have become more aware of the long odds against their offspring becoming sports professionals, they don't necessarily steer their kids toward a more likely future. Instead, he says, "A lot of parents today see those odds and say, well, I'd better get started early with my kid."

The table presents of how many NCAA athletes move on to professional careers in sports like basketball, football, baseball and ice hockey.  Professional opportunities are extremely limited and the likelihood of a high school or even college athlete becoming a professional athlete is very low.  In contrast, the likelihood of an NCAA athlete earning a college degree is significantly greater; graduation success rates are 86% in Division I, 71% in Division II and 87% in Division III.

Methodology and Notes  General  College participation numbers are from the NCAA’s 2015-16 Sports Sponsorship and Participation Rates Report .  These college numbers account for participation in college athletics at NCAA-member schools only.  To estimate the number of NCAA student-athletes in a sport eligible for a particular year’s professional draft, the total number of NCAA student-athlete participants in the sport was divided by 4.5.  This figure was used to provide a general estimate of the number of student-athletes in a draft cohort (single draft class) in a given year, accounting for redshirting, degree completion delays due to transfer, etc. that extend the average time to graduation to just beyond four year in all sports.  In other words, we observe a year-to-year departure rate (whether due to graduation, dropout or departure for a professional sports opportunity) of just below one-quarter of the total number of student-athletes in each sport.  Because the sports examined (M/W basketball, football, baseball, men’s ice hockey and men’s soccer) have dramatically different rules for draft eligibility, these calculations should be treated as estimates only.  Data on available professional opportunities are described below for each sport.  Baseball  MLB draft data from 2016.  There were 1,206 draft picks in that year; 695 of those picked were from NCAA schools (source: MLB Draft Tracker 2016 ).  Of the 695, Division I student-athletes comprised 595 of those chosen, Division II provided 80 and Division III had 20.  Percent NCAA to Pro calculated as number of NCAA student-athletes taken in the draft (n=695) divided by the approximate number draft eligible.  Not all of the student-athletes drafted go on to play professional baseball and many draftees fail to reach the Major League.  Men's Basketball  NBA draft data from 2016.  There were 60 draft slots in that year, but only 44 went to NCAA players (others chosen were international players not attending U.S. colleges).  Percentage NCAA to Major Pro calculated using the 44 NCAA selections. Since 2006, 12 international players have been drafted on average each year.  On 2016-17 opening day NBA rosters, former NCAA players filled 80% of roster spots (all were from Division I schools).  (Source: Jim Sukup, College Basketball News ).  Data on other professional opportunities in men’s basketball were collected by NCAA staff with the assistance of Marek Wojtera from eurobasket.com .  Tracking 2016-17 international opportunities for the 2016 draft cohort, it was determined that an additional 751 former NCAA student-athletes played internationally, in the NBA D-League, or in the NBA as undrafted players (535 from Division I, 181 from Division II and 35 from Division III) after leaving college; this includes international players who attended NCAA institutions (previous versions of this document did not include these players).  These numbers were combined with the NBA draftees to calculate an approximate NCAA to Total Professional opportunities figure (calculated as [44 + 751] / 4,152 = 19%).  We estimate that 3.6% of draft-eligible Division I players were chosen in the 2016 NBA draft (44 / 1,216).  However, in total, 48% of draft-eligible Division I players competed professionally (NBA, D-League, or internationally) in their first year after leaving college (calculated as [44 + 535] / 1,216). Approximately 14% of draft-eligible players from the five Division I conferences with autonomous governance (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) were drafted by the NBA in 2016 (32 / 225), while 74% played professionally somewhere in their first year post-college (calculated as [32 + 134] / 225).  Women's Basketball  WNBA draft data from 2016. There were 36 draft slots in that year’s draft, 35 of which went to NCAA players (other selection was an international player not attending a U.S. college).  All 35 NCAA selections came from Division I colleges. Percentage NCAA to Major Pro calculated using the 35 NCAA selections.  Data on international professional opportunities in women’s basketball were collected by NCAA staff with the assistance of Marek Wojtera from eurobasket.com , and are limited to the 2016 draft cohort.  It was determined that an additional 146 former NCAA student-athletes from the cohort played internationally in 2016-17 (131 from Division I, 14 from Division II and 1 from Division III).  These numbers were combined with the WNBA draftees to calculate an approximate NCAA to Total Professional opportunities figure (calculated as [35 + 146] / 3,687 = 4.9%).  We estimate that 3.2% of draft-eligible Division I players were chosen in the 2016 WNBA draft (35 / 1,110).  However, in total, 15% of draft-eligible Division I players competed professionally (WNBA or internationally) in their first year after leaving college (calculated as [35 + 131] / 1,110). Approximately 12% of draft-eligible players from the five Division I conferences with autonomous governance (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) were drafted by the WNBA in 2015 (24 / 203), while 28% played professionally somewhere in their first year post-college (calculated as [24 + 33] / 203).  Football  NFL draft data from 2016.  There were 253 draft picks in that year’s draft, 251 of whom were former NCAA players.  NCAA to Major Pro figure calculated using these data.  NCAA divisional breakdown of the 251 NCAA players selected in the 2016 NFL draft: Division I FBS (228), Division I FCS (20), Division II (3).  The five football conferences with autonomous governance accounted for 189 of the 251 NCAA draft picks (SEC=51, Big Ten=47, ACC=33 [includes Notre Dame], Pac-12=32, Big 12=26).  Data on Arena League and Canadian Football League opportunities were collected by NCAA staff via rosters on each organization’s website (sources: cfl.ca and arenafootball.com ) in March 2017.  Due to the timing of each league’s season, the 2015 draft cohort was used to estimate unique playing opportunities in the Arena League, while the 2016 draft cohort was used to track CFL rookies. It was determined that an additional 57 former NCAA student-athletes from those draft cohorts were listed on a roster (28 in the CFL, 29 in the Arena League).  Across these two leagues, there were 29 former Division I FBS players, 14 from Division I FCS, 13 from Division II and 1 from Division III.  These numbers were combined with the NFL draftees to calculate an NCAA to Total Professional opportunities proportion (calculated as [251 + 57] /16,369).  We estimate that 3.9% of draft-eligible Division I players were chosen in the 2016 NFL draft (248 / 6,307).  Limiting this calculation to subdivision, 6.7% of FBS players were estimated to be drafted (228 / 3,404), as compared to 0.7% of FCS players (20 / 2,902).  Narrowing further to the five Division I conferences with autonomous governance (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC), we estimate that 11% were drafted (189 / 1,747).  Accounting for Arena League and CFL opportunities, the NCAA to Total Professional figures are estimated as 4.6% for Division I ([248 + 43] / 6,307), 7.4% for FBS ([222 + 29] / 3,404) and 12% for the five autonomous conferences ([189+ 19] / 1,747).  Men’s ice hockey  NHL draft data from 2015 (source: hockeydb.com ).  There were 211 draft picks in that year.  Only 7 players from NCAA rosters were selected in that draft (all from Division I teams).  However, this is not indicative of the likelihood of going from a college team to a professional team due to the nature of the NHL draft, where players are typically selected prior to turning college-aged.  In examining the subsequent hockey pathways of 2015 draftees (hockeydb.com), it was determined that 51 of the 211 (source: collegehockeyinc.com ) attended an NCAA college for any period of time through February 2017. These numbers, although not fully comparable to those used in the other sports examined, were used to calculate an approximate NCAA to Major Pro percentage.  Note that only a small subset of players drafted ever play in an NHL game.  Undrafted college players may go on to sign contracts with NHL teams after completing college (those numbers are not part of the current NCAA to Major Pro calculation).  In 2016, 30% of players on active NHL rosters played college hockey (all in Division I), up from about 20% in the year 2000 (source: collegehockeyinc.com ).  71% of former college players in the NHL played at least three college seasons, and 36% played all four. Thanks to Nate Ewell at College Hockey, Inc. for providing these data.  Men’s soccer  MLS SuperDraft data from 2016.  There were 81 draft slots in that year, but only 75 players were selected (all from NCAA schools).  Of the 75 picks, 72 were NCAA Division I student-athletes, two were from Division II and one was from Division III.  Percentage NCAA to Major Pro calculated using the 75 NCAA selections. (Source: mlssoccer.com ).  These calculations do not account for other domestic (e.g., NASL, USL) or international professional soccer opportunities.

The odds of becoming a pro soccer player are basically the odds of picking an even prime number out of a hat of all the numbers in the world: one in a gajillion-bazillion-infinity. Good luck with that. Want some concrete statistics? In the United States, even if you do everything right and are good enough to get a prestigious full-ride scholarship to college, only 1.7 percent of college soccer players end up playing professionally. (And only 0.08 percent of high school players play professionally.) Those are some terrible, terrible odds. And it's not much better anywhere else in the world either, where even more people play "football" and even more people want to play professionally.

According to the Canadian Casino company, there are more than one million high school football players across the United States, yet only 256 athletes are drafted into the NFL each year. That means the odds of a high school player being drafted are 1 in 4,233. It gets worse. With only 46 players drafted every year by the NBA, the odds of going pro are 11,771 to 1. For women wanting to play in the WNBA, it's even harder, specifically 13,015 to 1. It turns out your best odds of becoming a professional athlete in America are in hockey. According to the site, 1 in 598 high school players are drafted by NHL teams.

The Journey. The Dream," about how children enrolled in academies have a very small chance of succeeding as professional footballers. Here's a transcript of the video: Academies of their very essence are a good idea. Get the best players, give them the best coaches in the best potential environment. The problem is that the ills of senior football - greed, opportunism, the stockpiling of talent unnecessarily for commercial gain - are seeping down into junior football. That's what's happening in the academies of the major clubs where boys are going in, they're sucked into the system. They're taken over by the dream. But, realistically, all they would do is sit there and wait for a chance that will never come. The statistics are really sobering. Out of all the boys who enter an academy at the age of 9, less than half of 1% make it. Or a make a living from the game either. The most damning statistic of all is only 180 of the 1.5 million players who are playing organised youth football in England at any one time will make it as a Premier League pro. That's a success rate of 0.012%. Pretty much the sort of chances of you being hit by a meteorite on your way home. Produced by Claudia Romeo. Filmed by David Ibekwe .

D., Registered Investment Adv; Updated March 23, 2018      Related Articles   1 [Statistics] | Statistics on People Getting Famous in Acting  2 [Pay Scale] | Pay Scale for a Sports Analyst  3 [Sports Law] | How to Become a Sports Law Paralegal  4 [Sports Management] | Sports Management Careers & Salaries     All over sports-infatuated America kids are explaining to friends and family their plans for the future. In grade school, the most popular occupation is a career in professional sports. This aspiration collides with reality in various ways, some funny, some a little depressing and others almost heart-breaking. The reality is that a mere fraction of a percent will have such a career, and among those that do, only a privileged and exceptional few will sustain that career for more than one-to-three years.        The Stats Beginning with the hard stats compiled in 2017 by the National College Athletic Association (NCAA), here are the odds of your kid or anyone's kid making it to the pros. Just to keep it real, anyone who didn't play a sport in high-school has been eliminated:  high-school basketball to college (male): 3.3 percent  high-school  basketball to pros (male): 0.03 percent  high-school basketball to college (female): 3.9 percent  high-school  basketball to pros (female):0.03 percent    The dice have been loaded slightly toward pessimistic outcomes. The stats for basketball players are the worst. But, as you might expect, the stats for pro football outcomes were nearly as bad at 0.08 percent. High-school athletes in other sports weren't that much more likely to make it to the pros either. A male high-school hockey player's chances were only 0.07 percent, for male high-school soccer players the odds were 0.09 percent. Even these somewhat depressing outcomes don't necessarily tell the full story, which is still worse. One reason the stats are more favorable in football than in basketball is that in basketball there isn't a system of farm teams. A lot of high-school baseball players make it to the pros in name only. Most end up making a marginal income in farm clubs, where, according to a 2016 player's suit against Major League Baseball, the average farm club player makes about $4 an hour. Less a Living Than a Taste of a Living Another depressing statistic has to do with how long these big-time sports careers last. Overall, the average professional football player's career in the NFL lasts 3.3 years. Even this doesn't fully reveal the fleetingness of near-fame because a few stars stick around for a long time, especially quarterbacks – possibly because the better a quarterback plays, the less he gets pounded. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde's NFL career, for instance, lasted 21 years. But for really good athletes who are almost exceptional – a player drafted into the NFL in the third round, for instance – fewer than half last five seasons. And for really good athletes who aren't exceptional – an NFL player drafted in the seventh round, for instance – fewer than half make it to the second season. "Only Poor People Buy Lottery Tickets" Whoever first made the often repeated remark about poor people and lottery tickets may have been cynical, but according to The Journal of Gambling Studies, they weren't wrong. From the bottom, you're always looking up. Accordingly, a winning lottery ticket or a child who makes it to the big leagues is a dream that gathers intensity in inverse proportion to income. According to a 2015 poll conducted jointly by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and The Harvard School of Public Health, about a quarter of U.S. parents with high-school children who play a sport hope they'll make it to the pros. But among families with incomes under $50,000, the percentage is nearly 40 percent. The near cruelty of the statistical unlikelihood of the fulfillment of this aspiration to sports wealth and fame is made slightly worse by its effect on parents. Tom Farrey, director of the Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute notes that as parents have become more aware of the long odds against their offspring becoming sports professionals, they don't necessarily steer their kids toward a more likely future. Instead, he says, "A lot of parents today see those odds and say, well, I'd better get started early with my kid."

Plenty of parents dream of their children cashing in on a sports scholarship , but before you get your hopes up  you need to understand the hard realities of winning these awards. Here are eight things that parents and student athletes need to know about these scholarships . 1. The odds of winning a NCAA sports scholarship are miniscule. Only about 2 percent of high school athletes win sports scholarships every year at NCAA colleges and universities. Yes, the odds are that dismal. For those who do snag one, the average scholarship is less than $11,000. 2. Full-ride sports scholarships are scarce. There are only six sports where all the scholarships are full ride . These so-called head-count sports are football, men and women's basketball, and women's gymnastics, volleyball, and tennis. In these Division I sports, athletes receive a full ride or no ride. 3. Scholarships can be dinky. Beyond the head-count sports, all other sports are considered "equivalency" sports. NCAA rules dictate how much money a program, such as lacrosse or track, can spend on scholarships. Coaches can slice and dice these awards as they choose, which can lead to awfully small scholarships. 4. Take flattery with a grain of salt. Coaches may tell teenagers that they have lots of scholarship money to divvy out, but prospects shouldn't assume that they will be the recipients, says Karen Weaver , who is on the sports management faculty at Drexel University . A coach might not know whether he wants a particular athlete until he finds out what other teenagers want to sign on to his team. What really matters is the scholarship amount contained in the school's official athletic grant-in-aid form. "Until you get the grant-in-aid form, it's meaningless," observes Weaver, who is a former national championship Division I field hockey coach. 5. A verbal commitment is meaningless. Weaver has heard of coaches telling athletes as young as seventh-graders that they want them for their team. There is no guarantee that a child who verbally commits to a team will end up on it. A coach can change his mind about a prospect. 6. Playing high-level college sports will be a full-time job. Division I athletes may as well be called full-time employees of their schools because of the long hours they work. According to a NCAA survey last year , playing football required 43.3 hours per week;  college baseball, 42.1 hours; men's basketball, 39.2 hours; and women's basketball, 37.6 hours. Because of the huge time commitment, as well as time
 away from campus, Division I athletes will often not be able to major 
in rigorous disciplines, such as the sciences and engineering. 7. Skip hiring an athletic recruiter. Coaches typically think sports recruiters are pests, says Weaver, who has served as a CBS sports commentator. Coaches don't want recruiters to get in the middle; they prefer direct dealings with the student athletes. 8. Forget about slick videos. Coaches don't want athletes to send lengthy videos. Two or three minutes will usually suffice, Weaver says. And you absolutely don't need to hire a professional to do the filming. Post your action video on YouTube and send coaches the link.

Division I student-athletes continue to outperform their peers in the general student body, when compared using the federal graduation rate.  More student-athletes than ever are earning degrees at Division I schools. The most recent Graduation Success Rate data, collected for student-athletes who entered college in 2007, show 84 percent graduated within six years.  The rate is up 2 percentage points from the class that entered in 2006 and includes gains in virtually every demographic.  “Supporting student-athlete success in the classroom is at the heart of our Association, and today’s announcement shows progress toward that goal that is nothing short of remarkable,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said. “We are delighted to see a record percentage of student-athletes achieve graduation, the ultimate goal of entering college.”  Football student-athletes in the Football Bowl Subdivision graduated at a 75 percent rate, a 4 percentage point increase. African-American Football Bowl Subdivision student-athletes increased their GSR four points.  The overall FBS rate represents an all-time high for the Football Bowl Subdivision.  Among student-athletes in men’s basketball and football, those who entered in 2007 increased their GSR over those who entered in 2006. Those who participate in men’s basketball raised their GSR from 73 to 74 percent, and student-athletes who compete in football at a Football Championship Subdivision school graduated at a 72 percent rate, nearly a three-point increase over the previous year’s entering class.  GSRs increased 3 percent among white male student-athletes and African-American student-athletes of both genders. White female student-athletes earned a 93 percent GSR, up two points from last year.  Since the NCAA began tracking GSR with the class of student-athletes who entered in 1995, the overall rate has increased 10 percentage points, which translates to nearly 14,000 more graduates than if the rate had stayed the same. In that same time period, academic standards for Division I student-athletes improved multiple times, with increases in initial eligibility standards, progress-toward-degree standards and the creation of the Academic Progress Rate, a more real-time mechanism to track a student-athlete’s academic success.  NCAA academic reforms made an impact over the past 13 years: As standards strengthened and the Graduation Success Rate increased, nearly 14,000 more student-athletes graduated from college.  The increase is particularly meaningful to University of Hartford President Walter Harrison, who chaired the Committee on Academic Performance since its inception in 2003.  “If I had to think about what makes me proudest, it’s those students who graduated because of the Academic Performance Program,” Harrison said. “We gave those students an opportunity, and they took advantage of it. By and large, you have so greatly improved your life by having a college degree that for me, that is truly the greatest satisfaction.”  GSR was created in 1995 in response to Division I college and university presidents who wanted a rate that more accurately reflected the mobility of college students than the federal graduation rate.  The GSR formula, intended to be a more complete and accurate look at student-athlete success, removes from the rate student-athletes who leave school while academically eligible and includes student-athletes who transfer to a school after initial enrollment elsewhere. The federal graduation rate, however, remains the only metric that allows comparison between student-athletes and the general student body. Student-athletes who entered college in 2007 earned the highest federal graduation rate ever: 66 percent. That rate is one point higher than the general student-body at Division I schools.  African-American male student-athletes earned a 52 percent federal graduation rate – 11 points higher than the federal graduation rate for African-American men in the overall student body. African-American female student-athletes graduate at 63 percent, a rate 13 points higher than African-American females in the overall student body. Federal rates in men’s basketball and FBS football do lag behind the rates of men in the student body, though African-Americans in those sports complete their degrees at a higher rate than African-American men generally.  Federal rates also provide a longer look at student-athlete academic achievement. They were first collected with the 1984 entering class and have continued to improve over nearly a quarter-century.  The rate for all student-athletes has increased 14 percentage points in that time. The 1984 entering class of FBS football student-athletes graduated at a 47 percent rate according to the federal calculation, compared with 62 percent of the 2007 entering class. Federal graduation rates for African-American student-athletes increased from 35 to 56 percent in that time period, and rates for white student-athletes increased from 59 to 70 percent.  “More student-athletes than ever before are leaving college armed with a degree,” said Kevin Lennon, NCAA vice president for academic and membership affairs. “Our members continue to set higher academic standards, and student-athletes continue to meet them.”      Media Contact Michelle Brutlag Hosick Associate Director of Public and Media Relations NCAA mhosick@ncaa.org       News Graduation Success Rate (GSR) FBS University of Hartford Men's Basketball Football                 Latest News      San Francisco failed to monitor its golf program        Findings for former Louisville program assistant vacated        3 schools honored for community outreach        DI Committee on Academics considers transfer rule changes        DIII member dues increase might take effect this year        2018 AASP Career Development Award recipients named        Villanova’s Matt Kennedy earns Elite 90 award        Soccer referees could start keeping official time        Chattanooga failed to monitor housing for tennis student-athletes        CIAA hosts empowerment symposium          View more >                                   Academics  Championships  Fairness and Integrity  Governance  Health and Safety  Champion Magazine  NCAA Publications  NCAA Hall of Champions  National Letter of Intent  NCAA.com  Committee Zones  Eligibility Center  Elite 90  Media Center  Program Hub                        Privacy/Legal Statement  Terms of Use  Contact Us  NCAA Employment  FAQs        Elite Daily The Statistical Breakdown Of Becoming A Professional Athlete Will Make You Keep Your Day Job By Julian Sonny Feb 26 2014 Share Hate what you do and have a passion for athletics? Well, don't quit your day job; you probably suck at sports. Being a professional athlete is much more than just loving to play the game and trying hard. It requires a level of dedication, sacrifice and discipline that, quite frankly, not too many of us are familiar with. To get the better picture, we've compiled some statistical data that solidify our theory that you will probably never be able to break into the pros. Every year, millions of kids have the same dream to make it to the next level. If you haven't been discovered by now, you should take it as a sign. Sure, nothing's impossible, but men lie, women lie; numbers don't! Thearon W.

They vary between the sports, of course, but according to a new study called “The Odds of Success” by Canadian Casino company Online Casino , they’re pretty very slim.  Ice hockey has the best odds — 1 in 598 for high school athletes — but even that pales in comparison to other things. Like fatal car accidents: People have a 1 in 113 chance of dying in a car crash, according to the study.  Wow, this took a dark turn. Anyway, here’s the infographic:    More Sports!

D., Registered Investment Adv; Updated March 23, 2018      Related Articles   1 [Statistics] | Statistics on People Getting Famous in Acting  2 [Pay Scale] | Pay Scale for a Sports Analyst  3 [Sports Law] | How to Become a Sports Law Paralegal  4 [Sports Management] | Sports Management Careers & Salaries     All over sports-infatuated America kids are explaining to friends and family their plans for the future. In grade school, the most popular occupation is a career in professional sports. This aspiration collides with reality in various ways, some funny, some a little depressing and others almost heart-breaking. The reality is that a mere fraction of a percent will have such a career, and among those that do, only a privileged and exceptional few will sustain that career for more than one-to-three years.        The Stats Beginning with the hard stats compiled in 2017 by the National College Athletic Association (NCAA), here are the odds of your kid or anyone's kid making it to the pros. Just to keep it real, anyone who didn't play a sport in high-school has been eliminated:  high-school basketball to college (male): 3.3 percent  high-school  basketball to pros (male): 0.03 percent  high-school basketball to college (female): 3.9 percent  high-school  basketball to pros (female):0.03 percent    The dice have been loaded slightly toward pessimistic outcomes. The stats for basketball players are the worst. But, as you might expect, the stats for pro football outcomes were nearly as bad at 0.08 percent. High-school athletes in other sports weren't that much more likely to make it to the pros either. A male high-school hockey player's chances were only 0.07 percent, for male high-school soccer players the odds were 0.09 percent. Even these somewhat depressing outcomes don't necessarily tell the full story, which is still worse. One reason the stats are more favorable in football than in basketball is that in basketball there isn't a system of farm teams. A lot of high-school baseball players make it to the pros in name only. Most end up making a marginal income in farm clubs, where, according to a 2016 player's suit against Major League Baseball, the average farm club player makes about $4 an hour. Less a Living Than a Taste of a Living Another depressing statistic has to do with how long these big-time sports careers last. Overall, the average professional football player's career in the NFL lasts 3.3 years. Even this doesn't fully reveal the fleetingness of near-fame because a few stars stick around for a long time, especially quarterbacks – possibly because the better a quarterback plays, the less he gets pounded. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde's NFL career, for instance, lasted 21 years. But for really good athletes who are almost exceptional – a player drafted into the NFL in the third round, for instance – fewer than half last five seasons. And for really good athletes who aren't exceptional – an NFL player drafted in the seventh round, for instance – fewer than half make it to the second season. "Only Poor People Buy Lottery Tickets" Whoever first made the often repeated remark about poor people and lottery tickets may have been cynical, but according to The Journal of Gambling Studies, they weren't wrong. From the bottom, you're always looking up. Accordingly, a winning lottery ticket or a child who makes it to the big leagues is a dream that gathers intensity in inverse proportion to income. According to a 2015 poll conducted jointly by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and The Harvard School of Public Health, about a quarter of U.S. parents with high-school children who play a sport hope they'll make it to the pros. But among families with incomes under $50,000, the percentage is nearly 40 percent. The near cruelty of the statistical unlikelihood of the fulfillment of this aspiration to sports wealth and fame is made slightly worse by its effect on parents. Tom Farrey, director of the Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute notes that as parents have become more aware of the long odds against their offspring becoming sports professionals, they don't necessarily steer their kids toward a more likely future. Instead, he says, "A lot of parents today see those odds and say, well, I'd better get started early with my kid."

The table presents of how many NCAA athletes move on to professional careers in sports like basketball, football, baseball and ice hockey.  Professional opportunities are extremely limited and the likelihood of a high school or even college athlete becoming a professional athlete is very low.  In contrast, the likelihood of an NCAA athlete earning a college degree is significantly greater; graduation success rates are 86% in Division I, 71% in Division II and 87% in Division III.

Methodology and Notes  General  College participation numbers are from the NCAA’s 2015-16 Sports Sponsorship and Participation Rates Report .  These college numbers account for participation in college athletics at NCAA-member schools only.  To estimate the number of NCAA student-athletes in a sport eligible for a particular year’s professional draft, the total number of NCAA student-athlete participants in the sport was divided by 4.5.  This figure was used to provide a general estimate of the number of student-athletes in a draft cohort (single draft class) in a given year, accounting for redshirting, degree completion delays due to transfer, etc. that extend the average time to graduation to just beyond four year in all sports.  In other words, we observe a year-to-year departure rate (whether due to graduation, dropout or departure for a professional sports opportunity) of just below one-quarter of the total number of student-athletes in each sport.  Because the sports examined (M/W basketball, football, baseball, men’s ice hockey and men’s soccer) have dramatically different rules for draft eligibility, these calculations should be treated as estimates only.  Data on available professional opportunities are described below for each sport.  Baseball  MLB draft data from 2016.  There were 1,206 draft picks in that year; 695 of those picked were from NCAA schools (source: MLB Draft Tracker 2016 ).  Of the 695, Division I student-athletes comprised 595 of those chosen, Division II provided 80 and Division III had 20.  Percent NCAA to Pro calculated as number of NCAA student-athletes taken in the draft (n=695) divided by the approximate number draft eligible.  Not all of the student-athletes drafted go on to play professional baseball and many draftees fail to reach the Major League.  Men's Basketball  NBA draft data from 2016.  There were 60 draft slots in that year, but only 44 went to NCAA players (others chosen were international players not attending U.S. colleges).  Percentage NCAA to Major Pro calculated using the 44 NCAA selections. Since 2006, 12 international players have been drafted on average each year.  On 2016-17 opening day NBA rosters, former NCAA players filled 80% of roster spots (all were from Division I schools).  (Source: Jim Sukup, College Basketball News ).  Data on other professional opportunities in men’s basketball were collected by NCAA staff with the assistance of Marek Wojtera from eurobasket.com .  Tracking 2016-17 international opportunities for the 2016 draft cohort, it was determined that an additional 751 former NCAA student-athletes played internationally, in the NBA D-League, or in the NBA as undrafted players (535 from Division I, 181 from Division II and 35 from Division III) after leaving college; this includes international players who attended NCAA institutions (previous versions of this document did not include these players).  These numbers were combined with the NBA draftees to calculate an approximate NCAA to Total Professional opportunities figure (calculated as [44 + 751] / 4,152 = 19%).  We estimate that 3.6% of draft-eligible Division I players were chosen in the 2016 NBA draft (44 / 1,216).  However, in total, 48% of draft-eligible Division I players competed professionally (NBA, D-League, or internationally) in their first year after leaving college (calculated as [44 + 535] / 1,216). Approximately 14% of draft-eligible players from the five Division I conferences with autonomous governance (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) were drafted by the NBA in 2016 (32 / 225), while 74% played professionally somewhere in their first year post-college (calculated as [32 + 134] / 225).  Women's Basketball  WNBA draft data from 2016. There were 36 draft slots in that year’s draft, 35 of which went to NCAA players (other selection was an international player not attending a U.S. college).  All 35 NCAA selections came from Division I colleges. Percentage NCAA to Major Pro calculated using the 35 NCAA selections.  Data on international professional opportunities in women’s basketball were collected by NCAA staff with the assistance of Marek Wojtera from eurobasket.com , and are limited to the 2016 draft cohort.  It was determined that an additional 146 former NCAA student-athletes from the cohort played internationally in 2016-17 (131 from Division I, 14 from Division II and 1 from Division III).  These numbers were combined with the WNBA draftees to calculate an approximate NCAA to Total Professional opportunities figure (calculated as [35 + 146] / 3,687 = 4.9%).  We estimate that 3.2% of draft-eligible Division I players were chosen in the 2016 WNBA draft (35 / 1,110).  However, in total, 15% of draft-eligible Division I players competed professionally (WNBA or internationally) in their first year after leaving college (calculated as [35 + 131] / 1,110). Approximately 12% of draft-eligible players from the five Division I conferences with autonomous governance (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) were drafted by the WNBA in 2015 (24 / 203), while 28% played professionally somewhere in their first year post-college (calculated as [24 + 33] / 203).  Football  NFL draft data from 2016.  There were 253 draft picks in that year’s draft, 251 of whom were former NCAA players.  NCAA to Major Pro figure calculated using these data.  NCAA divisional breakdown of the 251 NCAA players selected in the 2016 NFL draft: Division I FBS (228), Division I FCS (20), Division II (3).  The five football conferences with autonomous governance accounted for 189 of the 251 NCAA draft picks (SEC=51, Big Ten=47, ACC=33 [includes Notre Dame], Pac-12=32, Big 12=26).  Data on Arena League and Canadian Football League opportunities were collected by NCAA staff via rosters on each organization’s website (sources: cfl.ca and arenafootball.com ) in March 2017.  Due to the timing of each league’s season, the 2015 draft cohort was used to estimate unique playing opportunities in the Arena League, while the 2016 draft cohort was used to track CFL rookies. It was determined that an additional 57 former NCAA student-athletes from those draft cohorts were listed on a roster (28 in the CFL, 29 in the Arena League).  Across these two leagues, there were 29 former Division I FBS players, 14 from Division I FCS, 13 from Division II and 1 from Division III.  These numbers were combined with the NFL draftees to calculate an NCAA to Total Professional opportunities proportion (calculated as [251 + 57] /16,369).  We estimate that 3.9% of draft-eligible Division I players were chosen in the 2016 NFL draft (248 / 6,307).  Limiting this calculation to subdivision, 6.7% of FBS players were estimated to be drafted (228 / 3,404), as compared to 0.7% of FCS players (20 / 2,902).  Narrowing further to the five Division I conferences with autonomous governance (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC), we estimate that 11% were drafted (189 / 1,747).  Accounting for Arena League and CFL opportunities, the NCAA to Total Professional figures are estimated as 4.6% for Division I ([248 + 43] / 6,307), 7.4% for FBS ([222 + 29] / 3,404) and 12% for the five autonomous conferences ([189+ 19] / 1,747).  Men’s ice hockey  NHL draft data from 2015 (source: hockeydb.com ).  There were 211 draft picks in that year.  Only 7 players from NCAA rosters were selected in that draft (all from Division I teams).  However, this is not indicative of the likelihood of going from a college team to a professional team due to the nature of the NHL draft, where players are typically selected prior to turning college-aged.  In examining the subsequent hockey pathways of 2015 draftees (hockeydb.com), it was determined that 51 of the 211 (source: collegehockeyinc.com ) attended an NCAA college for any period of time through February 2017. These numbers, although not fully comparable to those used in the other sports examined, were used to calculate an approximate NCAA to Major Pro percentage.  Note that only a small subset of players drafted ever play in an NHL game.  Undrafted college players may go on to sign contracts with NHL teams after completing college (those numbers are not part of the current NCAA to Major Pro calculation).  In 2016, 30% of players on active NHL rosters played college hockey (all in Division I), up from about 20% in the year 2000 (source: collegehockeyinc.com ).  71% of former college players in the NHL played at least three college seasons, and 36% played all four. Thanks to Nate Ewell at College Hockey, Inc. for providing these data.  Men’s soccer  MLS SuperDraft data from 2016.  There were 81 draft slots in that year, but only 75 players were selected (all from NCAA schools).  Of the 75 picks, 72 were NCAA Division I student-athletes, two were from Division II and one was from Division III.  Percentage NCAA to Major Pro calculated using the 75 NCAA selections.

The odds of becoming a pro soccer player are basically the odds of picking an even prime number out of a hat of all the numbers in the world: one in a gajillion-bazillion-infinity. Good luck with that. Want some concrete statistics? In the United States, even if you do everything right and are good enough to get a prestigious full-ride scholarship to college, only 1.7 percent of college soccer players end up playing professionally. (And only 0.08 percent of high school players play professionally.) Those are some terrible, terrible odds. And it's not much better anywhere else in the world either, where even more people play "football" and even more people want to play professionally.

According to the Canadian Casino company, there are more than one million high school football players across the United States, yet only 256 athletes are drafted into the NFL each year. That means the odds of a high school player being drafted are 1 in 4,233. It gets worse. With only 46 players drafted every year by the NBA, the odds of going pro are 11,771 to 1. For women wanting to play in the WNBA, it's even harder, specifically 13,015 to 1. It turns out your best odds of becoming a professional athlete in America are in hockey. According to the site, 1 in 598 high school players are drafted by NHL teams.

The Journey. The Dream," about how children enrolled in academies have a very small chance of succeeding as professional footballers. Here's a transcript of the video: Academies of their very essence are a good idea. Get the best players, give them the best coaches in the best potential environment. The problem is that the ills of senior football - greed, opportunism, the stockpiling of talent unnecessarily for commercial gain - are seeping down into junior football. That's what's happening in the academies of the major clubs where boys are going in, they're sucked into the system. They're taken over by the dream. But, realistically, all they would do is sit there and wait for a chance that will never come. The statistics are really sobering. Out of all the boys who enter an academy at the age of 9, less than half of 1% make it. Or a make a living from the game either. The most damning statistic of all is only 180 of the 1.5 million players who are playing organised youth football in England at any one time will make it as a Premier League pro. That's a success rate of 0.012%. Pretty much the sort of chances of you being hit by a meteorite on your way home. Produced by Claudia Romeo. Filmed by David Ibekwe .
