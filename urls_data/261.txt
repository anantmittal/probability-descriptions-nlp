Even if you offer to leave him a gun to protect himself. Why? It's because on some instinctual level, all humans know it's just a matter of time until the zombies show up.  Our culture is full of tales of the undead walking the Earth, from our religions to our comic books. But, some sort of zombie apocalypse isn't actually possible, right?  Right ?  Guys?  Actually, yes. It's quite possible. Here's five ways it could happen, according to science.   Advertisement   5 Brain Parasites   As seen in ... Resident Evil IV  What are they? Parasites that turn victims into mindless, zombie-like slaves are fairly common in nature. There's one called toxoplasmosa gondii that seems to devote its entire existence to being terrifying.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     This bug infects rats, but can only breed inside the intestines of a cat. The parasite knows it needs to get the rat inside the cat (yes, we realize this sounds like the beginning of the most fucked-up Dr. Seuss poem ever) so the parasite takes over the rat's freaking brain , and intentionally makes it scurry toward where the cats hang out. The rat is being programmed to get itself eaten, and it doesn't even know.  Of course, those are just rats, right?  How it can result in zombies: Hey, did we mention that half the human population on Earth is infected with toxoplasmosa , and don't know it? Hey, maybe you're one of them. Flip a coin.  Oh, also, they've done studies and shown that the infected see a change in their personality and have a higher chance of going batshit insane .  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: Humans and rats aren't all that different; thats why they use them to test our drugs. All it takes is a more evolved version of toxoplasmosa, one that could to do us what it does to the rats. So, imagine if half the world suddenly had no instinct for self-preservation or rational thought. Even less than they do now, we mean.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement        If you're comforting yourself with the thought that it may take forever for such a parasite to evolve, you're forgetting about all the biological weapons programs around the world, intentionally weaponizing such bugs. You've got to wonder if the lab workers don't carry out their work under the unwitting command of the toxoplasmosa gondii already in their brains. If you don't want to sleep at night, that is.  You may be protesting that technically these people have never been dead and thus don't fit the dictionary definition of "zombies," but we can assure you that the distinction won't matter a whole lot once these groaning hordes are clawing their way through your windows.   4 Neurotoxins       ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement      As seen in ... The movie The Serpent and the Rainbow , the upcoming Resident Evil 5 video game.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     What are they? There are certain kinds of poisons that slow your bodily functions to the point that you'll be considered dead, even to a doctor (okay, maybe not to a good doctor). The poison from fugu (Japanese blowfish) can do this.  The victims can then be brought back under the effects of a drug like datura stramonium (or other chemicals called alkaloids ) that leave them in a trance-like state with no memory, but still able to perform simple tasks like eating, sleeping, moaning and shambling around with their arms outstretched.  How it can result in zombies: "Can?" How about "does."  This stuff has happened in Haiti; that's where the word "zombie" comes from. There are books about it, the most famous ones by Dr. Wade Davis ( Passage of Darkness and The Serpent and the Rainbow ). Yes, the movie The Serpent and the Rainbow was based on this guy's actual science stuff. How much of it was fact? Well, there was that one scene where they strapped the guy naked to a chair and drove a huge spike through his balls. We're hoping that part wasn't true.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement      What is definitely true is the story of Clairvius Narcisse . He was a Haitian guy who was declared dead by two doctors and buried in 1962. They found him wandering around the village 18 years later. It turned out the local voodoo priests had been using naturally occurring chemicals to basically zombify people and putting them to work on the sugar plantations ( no, really ).  So, the next time you're pouring a little packet of sugar into your coffee, remember that it may have been handled by a zombie at some point.  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: On the one hand, it's already fucking happened! So that earns it some street cred right off the bat. But, even if some evil genius intentionally distributed alkaloid toxins to a population to turn them into a shambling, mindless horde, there is no way to make these zombies aggressive or cannabalistic.  Yet.   3 The Real Rage Virus     ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     As seen in ... 28 Days Later  What is it? In the movie, it was a virus that turned human beings into mindless killing machines. In real life, we have a series of brain disorders that do the same thing. They were never contagious, of course. Then, Mad Cow Disease came along. It attacks the cow's spinal cord and brain, turning it into a stumbling, mindless attack cow.  And, when humans eat the meat ...  How it can result in zombies: When Mad Cow gets in humans, they call it Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Check out the symptoms:   Changes in gait (walking)  Hallucinations  Lack of coordination (for example, stumbling and falling)  Muscle twitching  Myoclonic jerks or seizures  Rapidly developing delirium or dementia   Sure, the disease is rare (though maybe not as rare as we think ) and the afflicted aren't known to chase after people in murderous mobs. Yet.      ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       But, it proves widespread brain infections of the Rage variety are just a matter of waiting for the right disease to come along.  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: If the whole sudden, mindless violence idea seems far-fetched, remember that you are just one brain chemical (serotonin) away from turning into a mindless killing machine (they've tested it by putting rats in Deathmatch-style cages and watching them turn on each other ). All it would take is a disease that destroys the brain's ability to absorb that one chemical and suddenly it's a real-world 28 Days Later .    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     So, imagine such an evolved disease, which we'll call Super Mad Cow (or, Madder Cow) getting a foothold through the food supply. Say this disease spreads through blood-on-blood contact, or saliva-on-blood contact. Now you have a Rage-type virus that can be transmitted with a bite.   Just like the movie. With one bite, you're suddenly the worst kind of zombie:  A fast zombie.    2 Neurogenesis   As seen in ... Laboratories around the world.  What is it? You know all that conversy out there about stem cell research? Well, the whole thing with stem cells is that they can basically be used to re-generate dead cells. Particularly of interest to zombologists like ourselves is neurogenesis , the method by which they can re-grow dead brain tissue.  You can see where this is going.  How it can result in zombies: You wanted the undead to make an appearance in this article? Well, here you go, you creepy bastards.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Science can pretty much save you from anything but brain death; they can swap out organs but when the brain turns to mush, you're gone. Right?  Well, not for long. They're already able to re-grow the brains of comatose head trauma patients until they wake up and walk around again.  Couple that with the new ability to keep a dead body in a state of suspended animation so that it can be brought back to life later, and soon we'll be able to bring back the dead, as long as we get to them quickly enough.  That sounds great, right? Well, this lab dedicated to "reanimation research" (yes, that's what they call it) explains how the process of "reanimating" a person creates a problem. It causes the brain to die off from the outside in. The outside being the cortex, the nice part of you that makes humans human. That just leaves the part that controls basic motor function and primitive instincts behind.  Reanimation research (artist's rendering)  You don't need the cortex to survive; all you need is the stem and you'll still be able to mindlessly walk and eat and enjoy Grey's Anatomy . This is how chickens can keep walking around after they've been beheaded (including one case where the chicken lived for 18 months without a head ).    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     So, you take a brain dead patient, use these techniques to re-grow the brain stem, and you now have a mindless body shambling around, no thoughts and no personality, nothing but a cloud of base instincts and impulses.      ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       That, ladies and gentlemen, is what we like to call a real, live, undead fucking zombie. So there.  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: Think about it. Under every legal system in the world, all rights and responsibilities are terminated at death. All it takes is someone with resources and a need for a mindless workforce of totally obedient slave labor.  How long until somebody tries this? We're betting somebody in the world, maybe North Korea , will have a working zombie by Christmas.   1 Nanobots   As seen in... Michael Crichton's novel Prey , The PS2 game Nano Breaker    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     What are they? Nanobots are a technology that science apparently engineered to make you terrified of the future. We're talking about microscopic, self-replicating robots that can invisbily build--or destroy--anything. Vast sums of money are being poured into nanotechnology. Sure, at some level scientists know nanobots will destroy mankind. They just can't resist seeing how it happens.  How it can result in zombies: Scientists have already created a nano-cyborg , by fusing a tiny silicone chip to a virus. The first thing they found out is these cyborgs can still operate for up to a month after the death of the host. Notice how nano scientists went right for zombification, even at this early stage. They know where the horror is.  According to studies , within a decade they'll have nanobots that can crawl inside your brain and set up neural connections to replace damaged ones. That's right; the nanobots will be able to rewire your thoughts. What could possibly go wrong?  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: Do the math, people.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Some day there will be nanobots in your brain. Those nanobots will be programmed to keep functioning after you die. They can form their own neural pathways, meaning they can use your brain to keep operating your limbs after you've deceased and, presumably, right up until you rot to pieces in mid-stride.   The nanobots will be programmed to self-replicate, and the death of the host will mean the end of the nanobots. To preserve themselves, they'd need to transfer to a new host. Therefore, the last act of the nanobot zombie would be to bite a hole in a healthy victim, letting the nanobots steam in and set up camp in the new host. Once in, they can shut down the part of the brain that resists (the cortex) and leave the brain stem intact. They will have added a new member to the unholy army of the undead.   Now, it should be more than clear by this point that our goal is to be responsible researchers. We don't want to create a panic here. All we're saying is that on an actual day on the actual calendar in the future, runaway microscopic nanobots will end civilization by flooding the planet with the cannabalistic undead.  Science has proven it.  David Wong is the author of the equally plausible horror novel John Dies at the End and the upcoming This Book is Full of Spiders , available for pre-order now . It has already been banned in 74 countries.

Not all zombies in movies and on TV are created equally, as some are slow and dim-witted like in Night of the Living Dead , while others are intelligent and resourceful, like the ones Will Smith battled in I Am Legend . As pervasive as this theme is in science fiction, what does science have to say about the chances of this actually occuring?  Of course, there are those who take themselves far too seriously to be entertained by the concept of zombies. However, there are some serious and respected scientists analyzing features from pop culture zombies and using them to ask important questions about what is and isn’t possible for the human brain and body. The CDC has even issued a zombie preparedness plan , packed full of ideas to be prepared when the dead start walking. By the strangest darn coincidence, it happens to match the list of what would be useful for other emergencies. However, prepping to blast some zombies is a lot more fun than thinking about hiding in a basement from a tornado, which is why the CDC stuck with it.  Typically, zombies come about after being infected with a virus. How widely a virus spreads is related to how it is transmitted. A virus transmitted through contact with bodily fluids is much easier to contain than one transmitted through the air. This is why the most devastating outbreak of Ebola (transmitted through bodily fluid) has killed 4,877 people during the last 11 months , whereas influenza—which is airborne—kills over 250,000 people worldwide each year . If the zombie virus can only be spread through a bite, it would likely be contained before resulting in an apocalypse.  However, it’s important not to mince words here: the undead zombies seen on the silver screen will never be a real thing. The brain needs to be functional in order to send impulses to the muscles to move, and the heart also needs to be beating in order to circulate oxygen and nutrients. With zombies being dead and all, the heart isn’t pumping, the brain isn’t working, and the body isn’t getting what it needs. Case closed; they’re dead and staying dead.  It might be impossible for zombies to be undead, but what about living beings who possess the same traits? Steven Scholzman, a professor at Harvard Medical School, told LiveScience that the afflictions of zombies are neurological, and not a problem with being undead.  Neuroscientists Timothy Verstynen and Bradley Voytek echoed that sentiment when they teamed up to make a TED-Ed video in which they examine a zombie and use physical clues from the patient to diagnose the cause of the symptoms of the lumbering gait, incoherence, slurred and meaningless speech, and insatiable appetite. Each of these traits is similar to known neurological conditions and can be connected to lesions on a specific area of the brain. Though there aren’t any currently-known syndromes that encompass all zombie symptoms, the duo have coined the term Consciousness Deficit Hypoactivity Disorder to officially describe the condition.  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="// www.youtube.com/embed/dACNHRPdgqc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>        Comments               If you liked this story, you'll love these         Popular Stories          Week in Science  The IFLScience Newsletter  Sign up today to get weekly science coverage direct to your inbox                                      Navigation    Home    Team    IFLScience Store      Contact      Advertising      Legal            This website uses cookies  This website uses cookies to improve user experience.

Well, don't flatter yourself. According to one new estimate, everyone would be dead in less than a year.  Physics students at Leicester University calculated that in as little as 100 days, humans would be outnumbered a million-to-one if an infectious " zombie  virus " were to strike.   Read more   This is the reason the word 'zombie' isn't used in The Walking Dead  Man arrested for shooting through window while 'hunting zombies'     After just three months, things would be looking pretty dire for humanity, with only 300 of us left alive. Even if the last people on Earth were to somehow hold out for another nine months, it is unlikely that they would be able to repopulate the planet without being infected or eaten first.  Given the grim prognosis, it may come as a relief to learn that the research was conducted as part of an annual exercise testing students' ability to apply scientific models to hypothetical scenarios. So, the researchers are not really expecting the world as we know it to end.  Course tutor Mervyn Roy, from the university's physics and astronomy department, said he thought the topic might inspire students to engage in the complex physics required to make predictions.  “Every year we ask students to write short papers for the Journal of Physics Special Topics ,” he said.  “It lets the students show off their creative side and apply some of physics they know to the weird, the wonderful, or the everyday.”  The team's research paper was published in the peer-reviewed journal, which is run by students to give them experience of publishing, editing and reviewing papers.  Thankfully, their research did not stop at our extinction, either.  After the study had been completed, some students flagged up that, actually, humans are really good at adapting and overcoming adversity, but this was not taken into account in the original study.   In response, the team reworked their calculations and published an additional report, which considered that people probably would get better at escaping and killing zombies, and could quickly have a lot of babies.  They might learn, for instance, that the best place to hide is in the mountains , not in shopping centres.  Given humanity's new-found survival skills, t he team re-estimated that it would take about 1,000 days, or 2.7 years, for humans to wipe out all the zombies.  In another 25 years, the human population should start to recover from the attack.  In both studies, the students had to decide on a number of variables, such as the parameters of the infection. They assumed that a zombie could find one person each day, and would have a 90 per cent chance of infecting them with the zombie virus.

Using the model, they split the human population up into three categories: the susceptible population (S), zombie (Z), and dead (D).  The lifespan of a zombie goes from S to Z to D. The team did not factor in natural birth and death rates in the initial study, because they focused on just 100 days — natural births and deaths over that time would be pretty insignificant compared to the destruction wrought by the zombie virus.  The model then analysed how often infected humans (zombies) would come into contact with non-infected humans, and how likely they were to pass on the disease, in order to see how many humans could survive.

By Sean Martin     PUBLISHED:  17:57, Fri, Oct 14, 2016  | UPDATED: 18:04, Fri, Oct 14, 2016            GETTY A zombie outbreak IS possible It is one of the greatest fears of humanity, inspired by a bulk of Hollywood movies, and scientists do believe that a zombie outbreak could happen. While it would be impossible to believe that the dead would rise and feed on the living, experts do think that a parasite could effect the brain or a virus could evolve. A parasite known as toxoplasmosa gondii is known to infect the brains of rodents. The parasite can then manipulate the rodent’s behaviour to make it fearless around cats – where the parasite is hoping to end up.

GETTY Toxoplasma can make rodents unafraid of cats The parasite has the ability to make the rodent head towards a cat where it will be eaten. However, what worries scientists is how similar rats and humans are – which is why they are used for testing drugs and medical breakthroughs. It is already believed that half of humans around the world have a dormant version of the parasite on their brains in the form of harmless cysts. GETTY Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that controls the brain Nonetheless, for some with immune deficiencies, the parasite has taken over which has been linked to schizophrenia and suicidal tendencies. A study from the University of California revealed that the parasite is more powerful than previously thought. Wendy Ingham, who was involved in the study, says that the team tested the parasite on mice which were ultimately unfazed by the presence of a predator once infected. GETTY Rabies has a zombification affect on animals She warned that toxoplasma is dangerous: “The idea that this parasite knows more about our brains than we do, and has the ability to exert desired change in complicated rodent behaviour, is absolutely fascinating. “Toxoplasma has done a phenomenal job of figuring out mammalian brains in order to enhance its transmission through a complicated life cycle.” Other experts however believe that viruses are what will ultimately turn the human race into zombies.       Dr. Ben Neuman, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, believes that a virus such as rabies could evolve and conquer humanity. He told Yahoo: “There are parasites out there that get close to making actual walking around zombies.     The Walking Dead season 7: Who is Negan's victim?

World War Z. Credit: Paramont Pictures/YouTube      Suppose a zombie apocalypse really happened. Do you think you’d survive? A team of students in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester took this question seriously. You’re not going to like the answer.  The students published a pair of papers in Leicester’s undergraduate Journal of Physics Special Topics based on an epidemiological model called SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered or Removed) that is often used to model the spread of infectious diseases throughout a population. They adapted SIR to model a zombie apocalypse.  In their first version of the model they assumed that zombies could infect, but not kill, people who were uninfected. They also assumed that there was a 90% probability that an uninfected person who met a zombie would be infected, and that zombies died after 20 days if they did not feed. They set the population of the world at 7.5 billion which is very close to current real-world estimates . The model was started with one zombie at day zero.           World War Z. Credit: Paramont Pictures/YouTube      Nothing much happens for about 3 weeks as the number of zombies slowly multiplies. And then the fecal matter hits the whirling cooling device. On or about day 20 the zombie population begins a meteoric exponential increase that is mirrored in a decline in the uninfected population. Most of the world’s population is wiped out over the next three weeks. On day 100 there are 181 uninfected survivors on the planet. You’re probably not one of them.   This grim version of the model assumes that there are no geographic boundaries like oceans or mountain ranges that might slow the zombie apocalypse down. The students modified the model to see what would happen if geography separated people into three zones. They assumed that zombies could not cross a boundary until there were at least 500,000 zombies in an infected zone. The zones were arranged so that Zone A was connected to Zone B and B was connected to C. The zombies couldn’t spread directly from Zone A to C.  Once again, the model started with one zombie in Zone A. The uninfected did a little better in this scenario but not by much. Again, nothing much happens for about three weeks and then the zombies increase exponentially. About a week later the zombie population decreases slightly as they try to make their way into Zone B. The respite is brief and the zombies quickly resume their exponential march (stagger?) to dominance. The pattern is repeated when the zombies move from Zone B to C. After 100 days, there are 273 uninfected people in the world.  But wait. There are a number of things missing from these models. People aren’t going to sit around waiting to be infected; they’re going to fight back. They’re also going to get better at avoiding zombies as time goes on – although they’re going to have to learn to do this quickly. Finally, if they can survive long enough, people can replace some of their losses by having babies.  The students published a second paper in the Journal of Physics Special Topics that took all of these factors into account. They added a parameter to the model that gives each person a 10% chance of killing a zombie when they meet. They modeled people’s increasing sophistication at avoiding zombies by replacing the 90% probability of infection when an encounter takes place with a parameter that decreases the chance of infection as the number of uninfected declines.  Births were modeled by assuming that the uninfected are equally divided between males and females, that half the uninfected are in a position to make a baby at any given time, and that half of the females are capable of having a baby. They also assumed that females could have one baby every three years.  Not all of the new factors benefit the uninfected; the zombies were also given some love. Their lifespan without feeding was increased from 20 days to one year.         World War Z. Credit: Paramont Pictures/YouTube      The uninfected do much better in this scenario. The exponential increase in the number of zombies is delayed by about 10 days but then it rises exponentially as before. However, at 100 days there are still roughly 200 million uninfected left alive. This is a drastic decline from the 7.5 billion that were alive when the scenario began but it is orders of magnitude better than the few hundred people that were left in the earlier scenarios.  The number of uninfected continues to decline but they manage to survive until day 1,000. At this time there are roughly 67 million uninfected left. This may sound like a lot but it’s approximately 88 survivors out of every 10,000 people who were alive on day 0.  On day 1,000 things look bad for the uninfected but they look worse for the zombies. Most of the zombies have died because there aren't very many uninfected left to feed on and the ones who are still alive have gotten very good at avoiding zombies. The zombies disappear completely over the next six years. About three years after that, the human population begins to slowly but noticeably grow.  So there you have it. If you quickly learn to avoid the zombies, fight back when you can’t avoid them and make babies when you’re not avoiding or fighting, you have a .0088 probability of surviving for 1,000 days. Think you can make it?  One thing that the models didn’t consider that you should be aware of is that zombies are always more dangerous at night. So, if you're planning on surviving for 1,000 days . . .  good night and good luck.  Note. The population numbers and survival probabilities given in this article for the final scenario were not directly reported in the student's paper. They were calculated based on measurements from a graph presented in the paper that showed how zombie and uninfected populations change over time.

Some People Suggest It's Not Just Science Fiction By Miles Surrey | April 1, 2016 Zombies are all over mainstream media — from TV shows like The Walking Dead to movies such as World War Z , we&apos;re obsessed with the idea of the undead. These concepts explore the primal urges of human nature, but they stay firmly in fiction, and shouldn&apos;t be the catalyst of anything besides unrealistic nightmares. That said, the thought of a zombie apocalypse and its ramifications are still topics of conversation, and beg the question: Could it actually happen? Science suggests it&apos;s very unlikely, but there are minute examples of zombified creatures in nature. Read more: Would You Survive a Zombie Apocalypse? It Probably Depends on Where You Live Rabies While human beings don&apos;t have an inherent lust for brains (except Hannibal Lecter , of course), rabies do exhibit oddly disturbing traits for anybody infected with it from an animal bite. Namely, the symptoms include mental impairment, agitation, strange behavior and delirium. Couple these symptoms with the aggression of someone attacking another person, and it certainly has the implications of a zombie attack in the guise of 28 Days Later . Source: YouTube However, human-to-human rabies transmission is incredibly rare , and such an event wouldn&apos;t cause a widespread panic. Rather, while some of the traits of rabies are admittedly similar to the aggressive undead, it&apos;s still a stretch to suggest it could become anything close to apocalyptic. Parasitic fungus On a very minor scale, parasitic fungus do attack creatures in nature, and essentially, turn them into zombified versions of themselves. Most notably, Ophiocordyceps is a fungus located in the jungles of Africa that infects the insects (ants especially), which allows it to stumble out of its colony and is guided by a pathogen that gets it to bite a portion of a leaf and die. If any other ants are in the vicinity where a giant fungi stalk grows on its head, they&apos;re in huge trouble when it bursts. It&apos;s pretty creepy stuff, and there&apos;s a media counterpart to Ophiocordyceps that&apos;s received a lot of praise: The Last of Us . The video game doles out a similar fate to humankind, but again, that&apos;s in the realm of fantasy. In reality, however, the likes of ants in Africa are being turned into zombies — and it is admittedly very unsettling. Source: YouTube Neurotoxins Neurotoxins have been used in chemical weapons — and that&apos;s dangerous, obviously — but it&apos;s possible they can also be used to great effect on an individual level. Moreover, depending on the proportions used, it can even stimulate the human body after death. At least, that&apos;s what supposedly happened in the most famous case of a real-life zombie, in Haitian man Clairvius Narcisse . Narcisse was presumed dead and was buried, but was purportedly brought back to a zombified state and sent to work at a sugar plantation following his revival. While it&apos;s unclear if this was a valid point of argument — it&apos;s a theory set forth by anthropologist Wade Davis in the 1980s, and has since been refuted by other experts — the Haitian zombie lore remains popular. Source: YouTube Bath salts Really, this stems from the infamous 2012 case in Miami where one man high on bath salts attacked a homeless man and viciously gnawed off his face in the process. The initial reaction was a stir of paranoia — like a scene from The Walking Dead in the middle of a metropolitan city. However, it&apos;s hard to pinpoint why it happened, whether it was the bath salts themselves or the man&apos;s mental state, but it&apos;s never been fully determined as he was fatally shot on-site by police. In any case, it&apos;s probably best you avoid inhaling bath salts, on the off chance you have a sudden desire for human flesh. Yet, as a responsive measure to the media craze, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made it clear it does not "know of a virus or condition that would reanimate the dead (or one that would present zombie-like symptoms)," CDC spokesman David Daigle wrote in a 2014 email to the Huffington Post . A cat poop parasite (no, really): Bad news for cat owners out there (and there&apos;s certainly a lot of them ): Your cat is plotting to control your mind. OK, that&apos;s definitely an exaggeration, but a food-borne parasite does make its way to cat feces, and can make its way into humans, as well — with unsettling results. The parasite, Toxoplasma gondii , actually begins its journey in rodents. The parasite can control the behavior of rodents so that they lose their inherent fear for the smell of cat urine. This is a big deal, considering this allows cats easy access to a meal — and no rodent in their right mind would want to approach the scent. Thus, the infection begins after a cat eats the rodent. It can then be transposed to humans if we accidentally ingest the eggs of the virus that are shed into the cat&apos;s feces — easy enough when we&apos;re always scooping poops. Some studies have suggested that being infected with T. Gondii can have serious affects on a human being&apos;s mental wellbeing. Czech biologist Jaroslav Flegr believes it&apos;s the cause of many mental disabilities, including schizophrenia, though his studies on the parasite have not yet achieved widespread scientific acceptance. Source: YouTube Obviously, even the worst-case effects of T. Gondii would be a stretch to suggest human beings are going to transition to a zombie-like state. In any case, the CDC was quick to point out that many of us are already infected with the parasite — yet, we should be fine. "More than 60 million men, women, and children in the U.S. carry the Toxoplasma parasite, but very few have symptoms because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness," the CDC says on its website . A hypothetical viral apocalypse would spread quickly, no matter where you live: Let&apos;s say you are patient zero of a viral outbreak (congrats!). Depending on where you live, how quickly will it spread? As it turns out, very, very quickly. An online simulator, Collapse , allows a user to get a play-by-play rundown of how an infection would spread after you put down a location. Now, the game says it&apos;s all within scientific reason, but it was also a promotional effort for the upcoming dystopian survival video game, The Division  (in the game, the virus is related to a smallpox outbreak, but you can swap it out with a zombie virus and get the same effect). Source: Ubisoft So, take it all with a grain of salt, but it&apos;s still fascinating to see how your decision-making affects how quickly a virus would spread. If you take the farthest possible route to the hospital or supermarket, chances are the world will be infected at a much faster pace. Ultimately, once airlines have infected passengers, it won&apos;t take long for the world to go dark. Source: Ubisoft Pop culture has always been fascinated with zombie outbreaks in a similar light, most recently in AMC&apos;s spinoff show Fear The Walking Dead . Unlike the flagship series, the show starts at the onset of the zombie apocalypse in Los Angeles. While it doesn&apos;t have a specific set of days to demonstrate the spread of the infection, there&apos;s a commonality in all zombie-centric storylines in the media: people will get infected swiftly. Source: YouTube The government&apos;s prepared, just in case: As unlikely as a zombie apocalypse is, however, the government&apos;s got our back. In 2011, the CDC released a "Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse" guide. While it is pointedly making fun of our paranoia for zombie outbreaks, it guidelines actual emergency preparedness steps in the event of an actual emergency situation (ie. a natural disaster, like a hurricane). "There are all kinds of emergencies out there that we can prepare for," the post reads. "Take a zombie apocalypse for example. That&apos;s right, I said z-o-m-b-i-e a-p-o-c-a-l-y-p-s-e. You may laugh now, but when it happens you&apos;ll be happy you read this, and hey, maybe you&apos;ll even learn a thing or two about how to prepare for a real emergency." Obviously, it was a clever vehicle for the spread of important information — reading the article in full, you&apos;ll have the knowledge necessary for a plethora of circumstances. More importantly, it was a huge viral hit for the CDC. "We have a great message here about preparedness, and I don&apos;t have to tell you that preparedness and public health are not the sexiest topics," CDC&apos;s preparedness department&apos;s head of communications, Dave Daigle said, in an interview with the Atlantic . "We posted it on Monday. By Wednesday, the server crashed."

According to a study recently published by students at the University of Leicester in the U.K., we'd all be dead within a hundred days of the rise of the undead. Students used a basic model often used by epidemiologists to track how quickly diseases spread. Assuming a single zombie spurs the outbreak on Day One, and assuming each zombie has a 90 percent chance of infecting one new victim per day, it would only take 20 days for the infection to become widespread. By the 100th day of the apocalypse, only 181 people on earth will still be alive. Even if you assume it would take longer for the infection to spread in distant parts of the globe, there would only be 273 survivors after 100 days. If you're a "Walking Dead" zombie fanatic and you think you're prepared to fight back by destroying the brains of your attackers, expertly avoiding bites and reproducing -- there is a small chance you can outlast the apocalypse. According to the model, zombies who have a lifespan of one year -- which is higher than the 20 days assumed in the original model -- it would take a little over 3 years to wipe out all of the undead. After 27 years, humans would begin to replenish the population again. Of course, who knows if this type of zombie will even be the kind to attack us? If the zombie apocalypse looks more like "28 Days Later" an infection can spread through blood or bite. But if it looks like George A. Romero's original "Dead" trilogy, zombies will spring from people who die of any cause, thus making it much harder for anyone to stay alive (and undead.) Regardless of what model you choose and how experienced you are in zombie survival, it's best to prepare yourself for the worst possible outcome in the event of a zombie outbreak.

		else{?    What's your zombie survival plan? You have one; do not lie. Mine is simple: find a boat on the river, escape the city and travel north along the coast until finding somewhere nice and quiet and defensible, and wait for it all to blow over.   Getting out of major urban centres like London is maybe the most obvious survival strategy, no matter the type of zombie posing a threat - from the shambling undead of Dawn of the Dead , to the fast-running infected (yes, they do count as zombies) of 28 Days Later. The fewer the people nearby, the fewer the number of potential threats, whether zombies or bandits.       A paper published this month on arXiv by researchers from Cornell has some interesting findings about whether the most obvious strategy is the best one - and it might actually have some real-world applications, too, in modelling the behaviour of rampant infectious diseases.   The scientists - from Cornell's Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics - use the "popular fictional disease" that is zombie infestation as a way of exploring epidemiological models built to simulate flu and measles outbreaks. There's a difference between zombies and other diseases, though, because of two things: bites are an unusual transmission method, and everyone who isn't a zombie could (or at least should ) be looking to destroy the brain of any infected individual to stop it spreading at all. For something like the common cold, one person living in a neighbourhood with a thousand people is going to infect more people than if they lived in one with only 50; but with zombies, every extra human is both a target and a threat.  The model they build takes this into account, so that if the average human is better at killing zombies than being bitten, you're not going to get much of an outbreak beyond patient zero. "Even a ferociously virulent zombie infestation might fortuitously be killed early on by happy accident," they write, and their model "allows the possibility that the humans manage to defeat the outbreak before it really takes off". So far, so good - but still, bear in mind that the chances of killing off the zombie disease drop off considerably once only a handful of people are bitten, assuming that people tend to live all near each other and have a decent chance of coming into contact with the infected.      Knowing this, and realising that mine or your chances of surviving a zombie outbreak depend massively on how far away, on average, we are from other people during the day - "surely, a zombie in New York cannot bite someone in Los Angeles," they write - the scientists have drawn up what they call a "lattice model", throwing a huge grid over a map of the continental United States, with each grid square being roughly 3km 2 . They also use two films ( Night of the Living Dead and Shawn of the Dead )  as their reference for zombie behaviour, and assume that zombies are roughly 1.25 times better at biting people than people are at killing them. Combining all of this together, and they could model both how successful infections are within each grid, and how successful they are at transferring between grids, averaging out the results of multiple simulations with patient zero living within different grid squares in the lattice. They found that within the first week, most of the American population would have been turned into zombies, with major cities and towns easily devastated. Yet, over time, things shift, because of population density - the coastal regions, with cities like Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC, fall early; yet, outside of the major cities of the central regions like Chicago, zombies have less luck. They can't walk across the countryside fast enough, in large enough numbers, to pose a threat to people living in more isolated areas. After 28 days, cities aren't the most dangerous places any more - instead, it's the suburban and rural places that are in between major population centres. Otherwise dull and quiet towns like Bakersfield in California, or Scranton in Pennsylvania, become extremely dangerous, as zombies move out of the biggest cities and along major highways to try and find more food.  The big surprise, though, is that even after several months sparsely-populated states like Montana remained almost entirely unscathed. It turns out that, as long as you can survive the first week and get to somewhere isolated, your chances of surviving the zombia apocalypse are pretty good. You might even be able to start thinking about repopulation, once they've fully decomposed and the vultures have done their work .      › PMQs review: Cameron's surprise pledge not to raise VAT floors Miliband        Ian Steadman is a staff science and technology writer at the New Statesman .

		else{?    Everything about Freya Farrington is glamorous. With long blonde hair and immaculate make-up, the full-time YouTuber films her videos in her pristine silver-and-white home. By talking to the camera about beauty, fashion, and meeting Justin Bieber “a couple of times” in Barbados, Freya has gained 12,000 subscribers in less than a year. But once a month – “every month” – the 26-year-old uploads a video you might not expect. A Poundland Haul. In the last year, 166,000 Poundland Hauls have been uploaded onto YouTube. In 2007, “haul videos” became exceptionally popular on the video-sharing site, with YouTubers showing off their latest purchases. Traditionally, hauls were high-end – vloggers filmed make-up, clothes, and expensive gadgets – but now, Poundland is the new Prada.      “At what point did all the beauty and lifestyle vloggers stop going to Gucci and Selfridges and start doing Poundland hauls??” asked one Twitter user earlier this month. A popular YouTuber with over 2.6m subscribers, Louise Pentland , also recently tweeted that she was “OB-SESSED” with the budget videos. Pentland’s own Poundland haul is the most-watched of the genre, with 283,593 views. Despite lasting over 12 minutes, the vlogger only spent £32.20 on products for the Christmas video (a far cry from the £792.21 worth of clothing shown in a recent Zoella haul ).      These videos find fans beyond YouTube, and there are over 13,000 members in a “Poundland Appreciation Society” Facebook group. “Please share your Poundland-related YouTube videos on the wall,” read the group’s rules, “Please do not post NON-Poundland videos to the wall.” What explains the trend? YouTubers have traditionally been aspirational, while Poundland traditionally hasn’t. Is this a symptom of austerity Britain? A backlash against YouTube consumerism? Does Poundland have an exceptionally proactive and successful PR? “They are definitely one of the most popular videos I film, second to Primark Hauls,” says Manchester-based Freya, who describes herself as a “bargain lover”.  “I always create content that I'd love to watch myself and Poundland hauls are one that I will always watch when YouTubers I follow upload,” she explains. “I take inspiration from the things you can make from affordable prices.”      A 2017 survey by auctioneers Pro Auction found that the average British person spends nine months of their lives bargain hunting, which typically works out at two hours a week. Rather than a symptom of societal change, Poundland Hauls could be popular because of an age-old love of bargain-hunting. Social media has removed any stigma some may have previously felt for bargain shopping, as people can find like-minded others on YouTube and Facebook.  Much is made of social media being “too” aspirational: generating unrealistic expectations, causing jealousy and depression, and showing off “highlight reels”. The rise of Poundland Hauls demonstrates a taste for the achievable over the aspirational, and a love of realistic, down-to-earth content. With over 75 per cent of children considering a career in vlogging , these hauls are also an accessible way for young people to start their own YouTube channels. In Freya's latest Poundland Haul, the blogger begins the video by showing off kitchen roll and toilet roll. She then showcases popcorn, a Terry's Chocolate Orange, rice cakes, three planters, two umbrellas, and 18 dishwasher tablets. In recent years, there has been a huge backlash over fakery in the YouTube community, with fans "exposing" YouTubers for Photoshopping, selling out, and outright lying. YouTube Poundland Hauls are an unobtrusive, simple form of video that make no pretences, perhaps explaining the genre's popularity. In the time it took to write this article, four more have been uploaded to the site.

By Beulah Maud Devaney       The undead take part in a traditional Zombie Walk in Stockholm, in August 2014. Image: Getty.   The received wisdom is that, once the dead rise and walk the earth, city dwellers won’t stand a chance. We’re too self-obsessed to notice the bloody handprints on our neighbour’s door. Polluted drinking water, feral lap dogs, roving gangs: it’ll all conspire against us, and we’ll be zombie fodder within a couple of hours. Rather than stay in our death-trap cities, the default advice for urbanites is to retreat to a perfectly stocked and secluded rural retreat. But what if I don’t want to leave my cosy apartment and collection of carefully neglected houseplants, only to die of exposure in a hedge? Is staying in the city really Darwin Award-worthy or could it actually improve our chances of survival? The question of whether city-dwellers stand a chance in a zombie strewn world was tackled in October 2015 by CareerBuilder and labour data source EMSI. Their researchers developed the Zombie Apocalypse Index (ZAI), which looks at which US cities would survive a zombie outbreak.    The ZAI works on the assumption that every US citizen is either a member of the armed forces or owns multiple guns. But for those of us who don’t have a sawn-off shotgun stashed in the biscuit tin, a different set of criteria will determine our survival. Population density, housing, government funding, crime rates, geographical location and cycling infrastructure (bear with me) will all play a role in determining which UK cities survive a zombie outbreak.  Potential for total isolation  During the first wave of an outbreak, when zombies and future zombies are clogging up the local infrastructure, the city-dweller’s best chance of surviving is to behave like they’ve got a terrible hangover. Those weekends when you don’t leave your apartment and start talking to the plug sockets and wondering if the entire outside world is Schrodingers Cat? That’s your life now. Once you’ve stacked your cupboards with baked beans and topped up the Netflix account, survival is possible for the most entrenched city-dweller. For a while at least. Assuming Deliveroo doesn’t survive the apocalypse, at some point you’re going to have to forage for food, and this is where total isolation starts working against cities. Those closest to natural sources of food (the coast, rivers, forests, the yogurt sample cart outside King's Cross station) will be fine. Ish. City-dwellers living more than a day's travel from the wild will probably have to move apartments – a stressful enough activity when the undead aren’t attempting to crack open your skull – or start developing a taste for pigeon.  Population density  A city’s survival rate can usually be tied to its population: the more people living there today, the more undead walking the streets tomorrow. Working out the largest UK city is surprisingly difficult , but if we’re going by the number of future brain munchers currently in residence, London comes out top with 8.5m. Meanwhile Preston, Oxford, Peterborough, York and Portsmouth all look like safe bets, with populations comfortably below 200,000.    The zombies take Sydney. Image: Getty.  Survival isn’t just how low or spread out your population is, however – and those of us living in densely populated cities still have a chance. Highly populated cities tend to have more apartment blocks and apartments are easier to defend than houses (more people, more food, staircases, etc). It’s also harder for people outside the building to steal your supplies. And speaking of crime...  Budget cuts  In The Zombie Survival Guide , zombie-handler Max Brooks points out that:  “Buildings in poorer, inner-city neighbourhoods tend to be more secure than others. Their reliance on high fences, razor wire, barred windows, and other anti-crime features make them readily defensible. Buildings in middle– or high-income areas tend to emphasize aesthetics... if the situation permits; head away from the suburbs and toward the inner city.”  George Osborne’s decision to remove the central government grant in April 2016 will leave local councils facing a £18bn cut in funding. In response many cities are talking about closing libraries, museums, parks and community centres. What critics are failing to appreciate, however, is that these neglected facilities will be perfectly placed to take advantage of a zombie apocalypse. Bare bones investment in public buildings now will lead to impenetrable fortresses on Z-Day.  Health care  Aside from population and (lack of) government funding, health care plays the biggest role in deciding a city’s survival rate. Hospitals were an important part of the ZAI, with Boston topping the league thanks to its “cure zone”. As the US city that has received the highest rate of medical funding, Boston has the best chance of containing and eventually curing an outbreak.   Some zombies on a water bus in Venice. No, really. Image: Getty. Unfortunately, due to a dramatic lack of investment in UK hospitals, the ZAI is unlikely to work for us. In fact, Brooks cites medical staff as the reason most zombie-outbreaks spread so quickly. They’re overworked, vulnerable to infection and surrounded by reanimating bodies. Bearing this in mind, hospitals and health centres are a delicate balancing act. You want enough of them to loot once the first zombie wave is over, but not enough that you’ll be fenced in by the undead. Basically, if Jeremy Hunt has closed half your city’s hospitals but kept the other half open with a skeleton (ho ho ho) staffs, you’re sitting pretty.  Cycling infrastructure  If I’ve learnt one thing from years lurking on survival forums (other than the fact that it is possible to drink you own urine three times before it loses all nutritional value) it’s that cycling is my default mode of post-apocalypse transport. A bike is the only vehicle that it’s possible for humans to carry around obstacles (unless you want to be the person using a Segway to run away from zombies). They also help maintain fitness, require no fuel, make very little noise and are easy to repair. Post-zombfest car drivers (still) aren’t going to be paying attention to cycle lane markings, but living in a city with cycling infrastructure will help survivors. Cities with cycling schemes are effectively gifting survivors with multiple cycling options, and studies show that good cycling infrastructure encourages citizens to buy their own bikes. All that means more bikes to be looted once the cycling scheme runs out. Game on.  Follow us on Twitter and/or Facebook for more tips on urban living at the end of the world.

Image: Getty.   On Sunday, home secretary Amber Rudd argued that the “biggest driver” of rising violent crime was the illegal drugs market. The growth of so-called county lines gangs, often recruiting young children to transport drugs around the country, is fuelling our £5.3bn black market in cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, and more. The violence of crimes from drug gangs is spreading outwards from our cities, with an estimated 4,000 teenagers in London alone caught up in smuggling operations. Between 2014-15 and 2016-17, the share of homicides where either victim or suspect was a drug user or dealer increased from 50 per cent to 57 per cent. Competition among drug dealers has reached such a high level that some are offering loyalty cards for repeat customers. But as politicians across the ideological spectrum discuss Band-Aid measures like tougher restrictions on buying acid and banning home deliveries of knives, the elephant in the room is our failed policy of drug prohibition.    In its recently-released Serious Violence Strategy , the Home Office inadvertently diagnoses many problems of prohibition. It correctly highlights that “grievances in illicit drug markets cannot be settled through legal channels, so participants may settle them violently. This can lead to escalation as dealers seek to portray themselves as excessively violent.” But this is entirely avoidable: the Home Office goes on to say that “violence can be used as a way of maintaining and increasing profits within drugs markets”. In other words, the escalation happens because drugs are illegal and unregulated. Gangs are sophisticated businesses, with strong incentives to keep their clients involved and those in their control under their thumb. Gangs in our largest cities run weapons and trafficking operations across the country. They use income from the drugs trade to finance their lifestyles, and the need to protect this feeds the firearms they trade – as seen in Liverpool where the Anfield gang jailed last year were found to be running the country’s second largest combined gun, drug and people trafficking operation with activity in rural Cheshire, Lancashire and even down to the South Coast. The violence these gangs create is entirely the result of forcing such markets underground. Legal, regulated alcohol companies solve their disputes through competition in the marketplace, and the courts if necessary. Illegal, unregulated drug gangs often solve their disputes by the less formal methods of murdering and robbing each other. And when police bust one gang, the resulting power vacuum can lead to heightened violence as those remaining vie for dominance. Economic evidence suggests that the introduction of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) in the USA led to a decrease in violent crime in states that border Mexico, and more wide-reaching liberalisation will have even greater effects. But it’s not just turf wars between rival gangs that disappear under legalisation. Problem drug users are free to seek treatment without fear of arrest; campaigners are currently calling for drug consumption rooms in London , Glasgow , and elsewhere. They are also less likely to fund their habit through theft. Washington State’s decision to legalise cannabis in November 2012 caused a reduction in thefts of between 13 per cent and 22 per cent . Property crime is likely to plummet if other drugs were legalised and regulated according to relative harm levels: official figures show that nearly half of shoplifting, thefts, robberies and burglaries are committed by regular heroin and crack cocaine users. Recreational users are also less likely to face violent crime. You don’t tend to get robbed at knifepoint purchasing alcohol in an off-licence, but buying cannabis in a dark alley is a different matter. Parents would no longer have to worry about the possibility that their teenage children are getting into cars with complete strangers in order to buy drugs, and any dealers who survive their market being swept away from them would face a police force with far greater resources to put them behind bars. Last week, David Lammy MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, “The police and our country has lost control of [the] drugs market.” He’s right – but more prohibition and more police on the beat won’t solve the problem of rising violent crime. The definition of insanity is continually doing the same thing and expecting different results. But we needn’t. The state is imposing the spillover cost of violence onto estates in our cities and onto the young people caught up in gang warfare. It has the ability to take this power away from gangs and become a world leader in harm reduction. The only way to gain control of the drugs market is to make it legal and regulated.

Even if you offer to leave him a gun to protect himself. Why? It's because on some instinctual level, all humans know it's just a matter of time until the zombies show up.  Our culture is full of tales of the undead walking the Earth, from our religions to our comic books. But, some sort of zombie apocalypse isn't actually possible, right?  Right ?  Guys?  Actually, yes. It's quite possible. Here's five ways it could happen, according to science.   Advertisement   5 Brain Parasites   As seen in ... Resident Evil IV  What are they? Parasites that turn victims into mindless, zombie-like slaves are fairly common in nature. There's one called toxoplasmosa gondii that seems to devote its entire existence to being terrifying.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     This bug infects rats, but can only breed inside the intestines of a cat. The parasite knows it needs to get the rat inside the cat (yes, we realize this sounds like the beginning of the most fucked-up Dr. Seuss poem ever) so the parasite takes over the rat's freaking brain , and intentionally makes it scurry toward where the cats hang out. The rat is being programmed to get itself eaten, and it doesn't even know.  Of course, those are just rats, right?  How it can result in zombies: Hey, did we mention that half the human population on Earth is infected with toxoplasmosa , and don't know it? Hey, maybe you're one of them. Flip a coin.  Oh, also, they've done studies and shown that the infected see a change in their personality and have a higher chance of going batshit insane .  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: Humans and rats aren't all that different; thats why they use them to test our drugs. All it takes is a more evolved version of toxoplasmosa, one that could to do us what it does to the rats. So, imagine if half the world suddenly had no instinct for self-preservation or rational thought. Even less than they do now, we mean.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement        If you're comforting yourself with the thought that it may take forever for such a parasite to evolve, you're forgetting about all the biological weapons programs around the world, intentionally weaponizing such bugs. You've got to wonder if the lab workers don't carry out their work under the unwitting command of the toxoplasmosa gondii already in their brains. If you don't want to sleep at night, that is.  You may be protesting that technically these people have never been dead and thus don't fit the dictionary definition of "zombies," but we can assure you that the distinction won't matter a whole lot once these groaning hordes are clawing their way through your windows.   4 Neurotoxins       ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement      As seen in ... The movie The Serpent and the Rainbow , the upcoming Resident Evil 5 video game.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     What are they? There are certain kinds of poisons that slow your bodily functions to the point that you'll be considered dead, even to a doctor (okay, maybe not to a good doctor). The poison from fugu (Japanese blowfish) can do this.  The victims can then be brought back under the effects of a drug like datura stramonium (or other chemicals called alkaloids ) that leave them in a trance-like state with no memory, but still able to perform simple tasks like eating, sleeping, moaning and shambling around with their arms outstretched.  How it can result in zombies: "Can?" How about "does."  This stuff has happened in Haiti; that's where the word "zombie" comes from. There are books about it, the most famous ones by Dr. Wade Davis ( Passage of Darkness and The Serpent and the Rainbow ). Yes, the movie The Serpent and the Rainbow was based on this guy's actual science stuff. How much of it was fact? Well, there was that one scene where they strapped the guy naked to a chair and drove a huge spike through his balls. We're hoping that part wasn't true.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement      What is definitely true is the story of Clairvius Narcisse . He was a Haitian guy who was declared dead by two doctors and buried in 1962. They found him wandering around the village 18 years later. It turned out the local voodoo priests had been using naturally occurring chemicals to basically zombify people and putting them to work on the sugar plantations ( no, really ).  So, the next time you're pouring a little packet of sugar into your coffee, remember that it may have been handled by a zombie at some point.  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: On the one hand, it's already fucking happened! So that earns it some street cred right off the bat. But, even if some evil genius intentionally distributed alkaloid toxins to a population to turn them into a shambling, mindless horde, there is no way to make these zombies aggressive or cannabalistic.  Yet.   3 The Real Rage Virus     ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     As seen in ... 28 Days Later  What is it? In the movie, it was a virus that turned human beings into mindless killing machines. In real life, we have a series of brain disorders that do the same thing. They were never contagious, of course. Then, Mad Cow Disease came along. It attacks the cow's spinal cord and brain, turning it into a stumbling, mindless attack cow.  And, when humans eat the meat ...  How it can result in zombies: When Mad Cow gets in humans, they call it Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Check out the symptoms:   Changes in gait (walking)  Hallucinations  Lack of coordination (for example, stumbling and falling)  Muscle twitching  Myoclonic jerks or seizures  Rapidly developing delirium or dementia   Sure, the disease is rare (though maybe not as rare as we think ) and the afflicted aren't known to chase after people in murderous mobs. Yet.      ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       But, it proves widespread brain infections of the Rage variety are just a matter of waiting for the right disease to come along.  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: If the whole sudden, mindless violence idea seems far-fetched, remember that you are just one brain chemical (serotonin) away from turning into a mindless killing machine (they've tested it by putting rats in Deathmatch-style cages and watching them turn on each other ). All it would take is a disease that destroys the brain's ability to absorb that one chemical and suddenly it's a real-world 28 Days Later .    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     So, imagine such an evolved disease, which we'll call Super Mad Cow (or, Madder Cow) getting a foothold through the food supply. Say this disease spreads through blood-on-blood contact, or saliva-on-blood contact. Now you have a Rage-type virus that can be transmitted with a bite.   Just like the movie. With one bite, you're suddenly the worst kind of zombie:  A fast zombie.    2 Neurogenesis   As seen in ... Laboratories around the world.  What is it? You know all that conversy out there about stem cell research? Well, the whole thing with stem cells is that they can basically be used to re-generate dead cells. Particularly of interest to zombologists like ourselves is neurogenesis , the method by which they can re-grow dead brain tissue.  You can see where this is going.  How it can result in zombies: You wanted the undead to make an appearance in this article? Well, here you go, you creepy bastards.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Science can pretty much save you from anything but brain death; they can swap out organs but when the brain turns to mush, you're gone. Right?  Well, not for long. They're already able to re-grow the brains of comatose head trauma patients until they wake up and walk around again.  Couple that with the new ability to keep a dead body in a state of suspended animation so that it can be brought back to life later, and soon we'll be able to bring back the dead, as long as we get to them quickly enough.  That sounds great, right? Well, this lab dedicated to "reanimation research" (yes, that's what they call it) explains how the process of "reanimating" a person creates a problem. It causes the brain to die off from the outside in. The outside being the cortex, the nice part of you that makes humans human. That just leaves the part that controls basic motor function and primitive instincts behind.  Reanimation research (artist's rendering)  You don't need the cortex to survive; all you need is the stem and you'll still be able to mindlessly walk and eat and enjoy Grey's Anatomy . This is how chickens can keep walking around after they've been beheaded (including one case where the chicken lived for 18 months without a head ).    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     So, you take a brain dead patient, use these techniques to re-grow the brain stem, and you now have a mindless body shambling around, no thoughts and no personality, nothing but a cloud of base instincts and impulses.      ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       That, ladies and gentlemen, is what we like to call a real, live, undead fucking zombie. So there.  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: Think about it. Under every legal system in the world, all rights and responsibilities are terminated at death. All it takes is someone with resources and a need for a mindless workforce of totally obedient slave labor.  How long until somebody tries this? We're betting somebody in the world, maybe North Korea , will have a working zombie by Christmas.   1 Nanobots   As seen in... Michael Crichton's novel Prey , The PS2 game Nano Breaker    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     What are they? Nanobots are a technology that science apparently engineered to make you terrified of the future. We're talking about microscopic, self-replicating robots that can invisbily build--or destroy--anything. Vast sums of money are being poured into nanotechnology. Sure, at some level scientists know nanobots will destroy mankind. They just can't resist seeing how it happens.  How it can result in zombies: Scientists have already created a nano-cyborg , by fusing a tiny silicone chip to a virus. The first thing they found out is these cyborgs can still operate for up to a month after the death of the host. Notice how nano scientists went right for zombification, even at this early stage. They know where the horror is.  According to studies , within a decade they'll have nanobots that can crawl inside your brain and set up neural connections to replace damaged ones. That's right; the nanobots will be able to rewire your thoughts. What could possibly go wrong?  Chances this could cause a zombie apocalypse: Do the math, people.    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Some day there will be nanobots in your brain. Those nanobots will be programmed to keep functioning after you die. They can form their own neural pathways, meaning they can use your brain to keep operating your limbs after you've deceased and, presumably, right up until you rot to pieces in mid-stride.   The nanobots will be programmed to self-replicate, and the death of the host will mean the end of the nanobots. To preserve themselves, they'd need to transfer to a new host. Therefore, the last act of the nanobot zombie would be to bite a hole in a healthy victim, letting the nanobots steam in and set up camp in the new host. Once in, they can shut down the part of the brain that resists (the cortex) and leave the brain stem intact. They will have added a new member to the unholy army of the undead.   Now, it should be more than clear by this point that our goal is to be responsible researchers. We don't want to create a panic here. All we're saying is that on an actual day on the actual calendar in the future, runaway microscopic nanobots will end civilization by flooding the planet with the cannabalistic undead.  Science has proven it.  David Wong is the author of the equally plausible horror novel John Dies at the End and the upcoming This Book is Full of Spiders , available for pre-order now . It has already been banned in 74 countries.

Not all zombies in movies and on TV are created equally, as some are slow and dim-witted like in Night of the Living Dead , while others are intelligent and resourceful, like the ones Will Smith battled in I Am Legend . As pervasive as this theme is in science fiction, what does science have to say about the chances of this actually occuring?  Of course, there are those who take themselves far too seriously to be entertained by the concept of zombies. However, there are some serious and respected scientists analyzing features from pop culture zombies and using them to ask important questions about what is and isn’t possible for the human brain and body. The CDC has even issued a zombie preparedness plan , packed full of ideas to be prepared when the dead start walking. By the strangest darn coincidence, it happens to match the list of what would be useful for other emergencies. However, prepping to blast some zombies is a lot more fun than thinking about hiding in a basement from a tornado, which is why the CDC stuck with it.  Typically, zombies come about after being infected with a virus. How widely a virus spreads is related to how it is transmitted. A virus transmitted through contact with bodily fluids is much easier to contain than one transmitted through the air. This is why the most devastating outbreak of Ebola (transmitted through bodily fluid) has killed 4,877 people during the last 11 months , whereas influenza—which is airborne—kills over 250,000 people worldwide each year . If the zombie virus can only be spread through a bite, it would likely be contained before resulting in an apocalypse.  However, it’s important not to mince words here: the undead zombies seen on the silver screen will never be a real thing. The brain needs to be functional in order to send impulses to the muscles to move, and the heart also needs to be beating in order to circulate oxygen and nutrients. With zombies being dead and all, the heart isn’t pumping, the brain isn’t working, and the body isn’t getting what it needs. Case closed; they’re dead and staying dead.  It might be impossible for zombies to be undead, but what about living beings who possess the same traits? Steven Scholzman, a professor at Harvard Medical School, told LiveScience that the afflictions of zombies are neurological, and not a problem with being undead.  Neuroscientists Timothy Verstynen and Bradley Voytek echoed that sentiment when they teamed up to make a TED-Ed video in which they examine a zombie and use physical clues from the patient to diagnose the cause of the symptoms of the lumbering gait, incoherence, slurred and meaningless speech, and insatiable appetite. Each of these traits is similar to known neurological conditions and can be connected to lesions on a specific area of the brain. Though there aren’t any currently-known syndromes that encompass all zombie symptoms, the duo have coined the term Consciousness Deficit Hypoactivity Disorder to officially describe the condition.  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="// www.youtube.com/embed/dACNHRPdgqc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>        Comments               If you liked this story, you'll love these         Popular Stories          Week in Science  The IFLScience Newsletter  Sign up today to get weekly science coverage direct to your inbox                                      Navigation    Home    Team    IFLScience Store      Contact      Advertising      Legal            This website uses cookies  This website uses cookies to improve user experience.

Well, don't flatter yourself. According to one new estimate, everyone would be dead in less than a year.  Physics students at Leicester University calculated that in as little as 100 days, humans would be outnumbered a million-to-one if an infectious " zombie  virus " were to strike.   Read more   This is the reason the word 'zombie' isn't used in The Walking Dead  Man arrested for shooting through window while 'hunting zombies'     After just three months, things would be looking pretty dire for humanity, with only 300 of us left alive. Even if the last people on Earth were to somehow hold out for another nine months, it is unlikely that they would be able to repopulate the planet without being infected or eaten first.  Given the grim prognosis, it may come as a relief to learn that the research was conducted as part of an annual exercise testing students' ability to apply scientific models to hypothetical scenarios. So, the researchers are not really expecting the world as we know it to end.  Course tutor Mervyn Roy, from the university's physics and astronomy department, said he thought the topic might inspire students to engage in the complex physics required to make predictions.  “Every year we ask students to write short papers for the Journal of Physics Special Topics ,” he said.  “It lets the students show off their creative side and apply some of physics they know to the weird, the wonderful, or the everyday.”  The team's research paper was published in the peer-reviewed journal, which is run by students to give them experience of publishing, editing and reviewing papers.  Thankfully, their research did not stop at our extinction, either.  After the study had been completed, some students flagged up that, actually, humans are really good at adapting and overcoming adversity, but this was not taken into account in the original study.   In response, the team reworked their calculations and published an additional report, which considered that people probably would get better at escaping and killing zombies, and could quickly have a lot of babies.  They might learn, for instance, that the best place to hide is in the mountains , not in shopping centres.  Given humanity's new-found survival skills, t he team re-estimated that it would take about 1,000 days, or 2.7 years, for humans to wipe out all the zombies.  In another 25 years, the human population should start to recover from the attack.  In both studies, the students had to decide on a number of variables, such as the parameters of the infection. They assumed that a zombie could find one person each day, and would have a 90 per cent chance of infecting them with the zombie virus.

Using the model, they split the human population up into three categories: the susceptible population (S), zombie (Z), and dead (D).  The lifespan of a zombie goes from S to Z to D. The team did not factor in natural birth and death rates in the initial study, because they focused on just 100 days — natural births and deaths over that time would be pretty insignificant compared to the destruction wrought by the zombie virus.  The model then analysed how often infected humans (zombies) would come into contact with non-infected humans, and how likely they were to pass on the disease, in order to see how many humans could survive.

By Sean Martin     PUBLISHED:  17:57, Fri, Oct 14, 2016  | UPDATED: 18:04, Fri, Oct 14, 2016            GETTY A zombie outbreak IS possible It is one of the greatest fears of humanity, inspired by a bulk of Hollywood movies, and scientists do believe that a zombie outbreak could happen. While it would be impossible to believe that the dead would rise and feed on the living, experts do think that a parasite could effect the brain or a virus could evolve. A parasite known as toxoplasmosa gondii is known to infect the brains of rodents. The parasite can then manipulate the rodent’s behaviour to make it fearless around cats – where the parasite is hoping to end up.

GETTY Toxoplasma can make rodents unafraid of cats The parasite has the ability to make the rodent head towards a cat where it will be eaten. However, what worries scientists is how similar rats and humans are – which is why they are used for testing drugs and medical breakthroughs. It is already believed that half of humans around the world have a dormant version of the parasite on their brains in the form of harmless cysts. GETTY Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that controls the brain Nonetheless, for some with immune deficiencies, the parasite has taken over which has been linked to schizophrenia and suicidal tendencies. A study from the University of California revealed that the parasite is more powerful than previously thought. Wendy Ingham, who was involved in the study, says that the team tested the parasite on mice which were ultimately unfazed by the presence of a predator once infected. GETTY Rabies has a zombification affect on animals She warned that toxoplasma is dangerous: “The idea that this parasite knows more about our brains than we do, and has the ability to exert desired change in complicated rodent behaviour, is absolutely fascinating. “Toxoplasma has done a phenomenal job of figuring out mammalian brains in order to enhance its transmission through a complicated life cycle.” Other experts however believe that viruses are what will ultimately turn the human race into zombies.       Dr. Ben Neuman, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, believes that a virus such as rabies could evolve and conquer humanity. He told Yahoo: “There are parasites out there that get close to making actual walking around zombies.     The Walking Dead season 7: Who is Negan's victim?

World War Z. Credit: Paramont Pictures/YouTube      Suppose a zombie apocalypse really happened. Do you think you’d survive? A team of students in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester took this question seriously. You’re not going to like the answer.  The students published a pair of papers in Leicester’s undergraduate Journal of Physics Special Topics based on an epidemiological model called SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered or Removed) that is often used to model the spread of infectious diseases throughout a population. They adapted SIR to model a zombie apocalypse.  In their first version of the model they assumed that zombies could infect, but not kill, people who were uninfected. They also assumed that there was a 90% probability that an uninfected person who met a zombie would be infected, and that zombies died after 20 days if they did not feed. They set the population of the world at 7.5 billion which is very close to current real-world estimates . The model was started with one zombie at day zero.           World War Z. Credit: Paramont Pictures/YouTube      Nothing much happens for about 3 weeks as the number of zombies slowly multiplies. And then the fecal matter hits the whirling cooling device. On or about day 20 the zombie population begins a meteoric exponential increase that is mirrored in a decline in the uninfected population. Most of the world’s population is wiped out over the next three weeks. On day 100 there are 181 uninfected survivors on the planet. You’re probably not one of them.   This grim version of the model assumes that there are no geographic boundaries like oceans or mountain ranges that might slow the zombie apocalypse down. The students modified the model to see what would happen if geography separated people into three zones. They assumed that zombies could not cross a boundary until there were at least 500,000 zombies in an infected zone. The zones were arranged so that Zone A was connected to Zone B and B was connected to C. The zombies couldn’t spread directly from Zone A to C.  Once again, the model started with one zombie in Zone A. The uninfected did a little better in this scenario but not by much. Again, nothing much happens for about three weeks and then the zombies increase exponentially. About a week later the zombie population decreases slightly as they try to make their way into Zone B. The respite is brief and the zombies quickly resume their exponential march (stagger?) to dominance. The pattern is repeated when the zombies move from Zone B to C. After 100 days, there are 273 uninfected people in the world.  But wait. There are a number of things missing from these models. People aren’t going to sit around waiting to be infected; they’re going to fight back. They’re also going to get better at avoiding zombies as time goes on – although they’re going to have to learn to do this quickly. Finally, if they can survive long enough, people can replace some of their losses by having babies.  The students published a second paper in the Journal of Physics Special Topics that took all of these factors into account. They added a parameter to the model that gives each person a 10% chance of killing a zombie when they meet. They modeled people’s increasing sophistication at avoiding zombies by replacing the 90% probability of infection when an encounter takes place with a parameter that decreases the chance of infection as the number of uninfected declines.  Births were modeled by assuming that the uninfected are equally divided between males and females, that half the uninfected are in a position to make a baby at any given time, and that half of the females are capable of having a baby. They also assumed that females could have one baby every three years.  Not all of the new factors benefit the uninfected; the zombies were also given some love. Their lifespan without feeding was increased from 20 days to one year.         World War Z. Credit: Paramont Pictures/YouTube      The uninfected do much better in this scenario. The exponential increase in the number of zombies is delayed by about 10 days but then it rises exponentially as before. However, at 100 days there are still roughly 200 million uninfected left alive. This is a drastic decline from the 7.5 billion that were alive when the scenario began but it is orders of magnitude better than the few hundred people that were left in the earlier scenarios.  The number of uninfected continues to decline but they manage to survive until day 1,000. At this time there are roughly 67 million uninfected left. This may sound like a lot but it’s approximately 88 survivors out of every 10,000 people who were alive on day 0.  On day 1,000 things look bad for the uninfected but they look worse for the zombies. Most of the zombies have died because there aren't very many uninfected left to feed on and the ones who are still alive have gotten very good at avoiding zombies. The zombies disappear completely over the next six years. About three years after that, the human population begins to slowly but noticeably grow.  So there you have it. If you quickly learn to avoid the zombies, fight back when you can’t avoid them and make babies when you’re not avoiding or fighting, you have a .0088 probability of surviving for 1,000 days. Think you can make it?  One thing that the models didn’t consider that you should be aware of is that zombies are always more dangerous at night. So, if you're planning on surviving for 1,000 days . . .  good night and good luck.  Note. The population numbers and survival probabilities given in this article for the final scenario were not directly reported in the student's paper. They were calculated based on measurements from a graph presented in the paper that showed how zombie and uninfected populations change over time.

Some People Suggest It's Not Just Science Fiction By Miles Surrey | April 1, 2016 Zombies are all over mainstream media — from TV shows like The Walking Dead to movies such as World War Z , we&apos;re obsessed with the idea of the undead. These concepts explore the primal urges of human nature, but they stay firmly in fiction, and shouldn&apos;t be the catalyst of anything besides unrealistic nightmares. That said, the thought of a zombie apocalypse and its ramifications are still topics of conversation, and beg the question: Could it actually happen? Science suggests it&apos;s very unlikely, but there are minute examples of zombified creatures in nature. Read more: Would You Survive a Zombie Apocalypse? It Probably Depends on Where You Live Rabies While human beings don&apos;t have an inherent lust for brains (except Hannibal Lecter , of course), rabies do exhibit oddly disturbing traits for anybody infected with it from an animal bite. Namely, the symptoms include mental impairment, agitation, strange behavior and delirium. Couple these symptoms with the aggression of someone attacking another person, and it certainly has the implications of a zombie attack in the guise of 28 Days Later . Source: YouTube However, human-to-human rabies transmission is incredibly rare , and such an event wouldn&apos;t cause a widespread panic. Rather, while some of the traits of rabies are admittedly similar to the aggressive undead, it&apos;s still a stretch to suggest it could become anything close to apocalyptic. Parasitic fungus On a very minor scale, parasitic fungus do attack creatures in nature, and essentially, turn them into zombified versions of themselves. Most notably, Ophiocordyceps is a fungus located in the jungles of Africa that infects the insects (ants especially), which allows it to stumble out of its colony and is guided by a pathogen that gets it to bite a portion of a leaf and die. If any other ants are in the vicinity where a giant fungi stalk grows on its head, they&apos;re in huge trouble when it bursts. It&apos;s pretty creepy stuff, and there&apos;s a media counterpart to Ophiocordyceps that&apos;s received a lot of praise: The Last of Us . The video game doles out a similar fate to humankind, but again, that&apos;s in the realm of fantasy. In reality, however, the likes of ants in Africa are being turned into zombies — and it is admittedly very unsettling. Source: YouTube Neurotoxins Neurotoxins have been used in chemical weapons — and that&apos;s dangerous, obviously — but it&apos;s possible they can also be used to great effect on an individual level. Moreover, depending on the proportions used, it can even stimulate the human body after death. At least, that&apos;s what supposedly happened in the most famous case of a real-life zombie, in Haitian man Clairvius Narcisse . Narcisse was presumed dead and was buried, but was purportedly brought back to a zombified state and sent to work at a sugar plantation following his revival. While it&apos;s unclear if this was a valid point of argument — it&apos;s a theory set forth by anthropologist Wade Davis in the 1980s, and has since been refuted by other experts — the Haitian zombie lore remains popular. Source: YouTube Bath salts Really, this stems from the infamous 2012 case in Miami where one man high on bath salts attacked a homeless man and viciously gnawed off his face in the process. The initial reaction was a stir of paranoia — like a scene from The Walking Dead in the middle of a metropolitan city. However, it&apos;s hard to pinpoint why it happened, whether it was the bath salts themselves or the man&apos;s mental state, but it&apos;s never been fully determined as he was fatally shot on-site by police. In any case, it&apos;s probably best you avoid inhaling bath salts, on the off chance you have a sudden desire for human flesh. Yet, as a responsive measure to the media craze, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made it clear it does not "know of a virus or condition that would reanimate the dead (or one that would present zombie-like symptoms)," CDC spokesman David Daigle wrote in a 2014 email to the Huffington Post . A cat poop parasite (no, really): Bad news for cat owners out there (and there&apos;s certainly a lot of them ): Your cat is plotting to control your mind. OK, that&apos;s definitely an exaggeration, but a food-borne parasite does make its way to cat feces, and can make its way into humans, as well — with unsettling results. The parasite, Toxoplasma gondii , actually begins its journey in rodents. The parasite can control the behavior of rodents so that they lose their inherent fear for the smell of cat urine. This is a big deal, considering this allows cats easy access to a meal — and no rodent in their right mind would want to approach the scent. Thus, the infection begins after a cat eats the rodent. It can then be transposed to humans if we accidentally ingest the eggs of the virus that are shed into the cat&apos;s feces — easy enough when we&apos;re always scooping poops. Some studies have suggested that being infected with T. Gondii can have serious affects on a human being&apos;s mental wellbeing. Czech biologist Jaroslav Flegr believes it&apos;s the cause of many mental disabilities, including schizophrenia, though his studies on the parasite have not yet achieved widespread scientific acceptance. Source: YouTube Obviously, even the worst-case effects of T. Gondii would be a stretch to suggest human beings are going to transition to a zombie-like state. In any case, the CDC was quick to point out that many of us are already infected with the parasite — yet, we should be fine. "More than 60 million men, women, and children in the U.S. carry the Toxoplasma parasite, but very few have symptoms because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness," the CDC says on its website . A hypothetical viral apocalypse would spread quickly, no matter where you live: Let&apos;s say you are patient zero of a viral outbreak (congrats!). Depending on where you live, how quickly will it spread? As it turns out, very, very quickly. An online simulator, Collapse , allows a user to get a play-by-play rundown of how an infection would spread after you put down a location. Now, the game says it&apos;s all within scientific reason, but it was also a promotional effort for the upcoming dystopian survival video game, The Division  (in the game, the virus is related to a smallpox outbreak, but you can swap it out with a zombie virus and get the same effect). Source: Ubisoft So, take it all with a grain of salt, but it&apos;s still fascinating to see how your decision-making affects how quickly a virus would spread. If you take the farthest possible route to the hospital or supermarket, chances are the world will be infected at a much faster pace. Ultimately, once airlines have infected passengers, it won&apos;t take long for the world to go dark. Source: Ubisoft Pop culture has always been fascinated with zombie outbreaks in a similar light, most recently in AMC&apos;s spinoff show Fear The Walking Dead . Unlike the flagship series, the show starts at the onset of the zombie apocalypse in Los Angeles. While it doesn&apos;t have a specific set of days to demonstrate the spread of the infection, there&apos;s a commonality in all zombie-centric storylines in the media: people will get infected swiftly. Source: YouTube The government&apos;s prepared, just in case: As unlikely as a zombie apocalypse is, however, the government&apos;s got our back. In 2011, the CDC released a "Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse" guide. While it is pointedly making fun of our paranoia for zombie outbreaks, it guidelines actual emergency preparedness steps in the event of an actual emergency situation (ie. a natural disaster, like a hurricane). "There are all kinds of emergencies out there that we can prepare for," the post reads. "Take a zombie apocalypse for example. That&apos;s right, I said z-o-m-b-i-e a-p-o-c-a-l-y-p-s-e. You may laugh now, but when it happens you&apos;ll be happy you read this, and hey, maybe you&apos;ll even learn a thing or two about how to prepare for a real emergency." Obviously, it was a clever vehicle for the spread of important information — reading the article in full, you&apos;ll have the knowledge necessary for a plethora of circumstances. More importantly, it was a huge viral hit for the CDC. "We have a great message here about preparedness, and I don&apos;t have to tell you that preparedness and public health are not the sexiest topics," CDC&apos;s preparedness department&apos;s head of communications, Dave Daigle said, in an interview with the Atlantic . "We posted it on Monday. By Wednesday, the server crashed."

According to a study recently published by students at the University of Leicester in the U.K., we'd all be dead within a hundred days of the rise of the undead. Students used a basic model often used by epidemiologists to track how quickly diseases spread. Assuming a single zombie spurs the outbreak on Day One, and assuming each zombie has a 90 percent chance of infecting one new victim per day, it would only take 20 days for the infection to become widespread. By the 100th day of the apocalypse, only 181 people on earth will still be alive. Even if you assume it would take longer for the infection to spread in distant parts of the globe, there would only be 273 survivors after 100 days. If you're a "Walking Dead" zombie fanatic and you think you're prepared to fight back by destroying the brains of your attackers, expertly avoiding bites and reproducing -- there is a small chance you can outlast the apocalypse. According to the model, zombies who have a lifespan of one year -- which is higher than the 20 days assumed in the original model -- it would take a little over 3 years to wipe out all of the undead. After 27 years, humans would begin to replenish the population again. Of course, who knows if this type of zombie will even be the kind to attack us? If the zombie apocalypse looks more like "28 Days Later" an infection can spread through blood or bite. But if it looks like George A. Romero's original "Dead" trilogy, zombies will spring from people who die of any cause, thus making it much harder for anyone to stay alive (and undead.) Regardless of what model you choose and how experienced you are in zombie survival, it's best to prepare yourself for the worst possible outcome in the event of a zombie outbreak.

		else{?    What's your zombie survival plan? You have one; do not lie. Mine is simple: find a boat on the river, escape the city and travel north along the coast until finding somewhere nice and quiet and defensible, and wait for it all to blow over.   Getting out of major urban centres like London is maybe the most obvious survival strategy, no matter the type of zombie posing a threat - from the shambling undead of Dawn of the Dead , to the fast-running infected (yes, they do count as zombies) of 28 Days Later. The fewer the people nearby, the fewer the number of potential threats, whether zombies or bandits.       A paper published this month on arXiv by researchers from Cornell has some interesting findings about whether the most obvious strategy is the best one - and it might actually have some real-world applications, too, in modelling the behaviour of rampant infectious diseases.   The scientists - from Cornell's Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics - use the "popular fictional disease" that is zombie infestation as a way of exploring epidemiological models built to simulate flu and measles outbreaks. There's a difference between zombies and other diseases, though, because of two things: bites are an unusual transmission method, and everyone who isn't a zombie could (or at least should ) be looking to destroy the brain of any infected individual to stop it spreading at all. For something like the common cold, one person living in a neighbourhood with a thousand people is going to infect more people than if they lived in one with only 50; but with zombies, every extra human is both a target and a threat.  The model they build takes this into account, so that if the average human is better at killing zombies than being bitten, you're not going to get much of an outbreak beyond patient zero. "Even a ferociously virulent zombie infestation might fortuitously be killed early on by happy accident," they write, and their model "allows the possibility that the humans manage to defeat the outbreak before it really takes off". So far, so good - but still, bear in mind that the chances of killing off the zombie disease drop off considerably once only a handful of people are bitten, assuming that people tend to live all near each other and have a decent chance of coming into contact with the infected.      Knowing this, and realising that mine or your chances of surviving a zombie outbreak depend massively on how far away, on average, we are from other people during the day - "surely, a zombie in New York cannot bite someone in Los Angeles," they write - the scientists have drawn up what they call a "lattice model", throwing a huge grid over a map of the continental United States, with each grid square being roughly 3km 2 . They also use two films ( Night of the Living Dead and Shawn of the Dead )  as their reference for zombie behaviour, and assume that zombies are roughly 1.25 times better at biting people than people are at killing them. Combining all of this together, and they could model both how successful infections are within each grid, and how successful they are at transferring between grids, averaging out the results of multiple simulations with patient zero living within different grid squares in the lattice. They found that within the first week, most of the American population would have been turned into zombies, with major cities and towns easily devastated. Yet, over time, things shift, because of population density - the coastal regions, with cities like Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC, fall early; yet, outside of the major cities of the central regions like Chicago, zombies have less luck. They can't walk across the countryside fast enough, in large enough numbers, to pose a threat to people living in more isolated areas. After 28 days, cities aren't the most dangerous places any more - instead, it's the suburban and rural places that are in between major population centres. Otherwise dull and quiet towns like Bakersfield in California, or Scranton in Pennsylvania, become extremely dangerous, as zombies move out of the biggest cities and along major highways to try and find more food.  The big surprise, though, is that even after several months sparsely-populated states like Montana remained almost entirely unscathed. It turns out that, as long as you can survive the first week and get to somewhere isolated, your chances of surviving the zombia apocalypse are pretty good. You might even be able to start thinking about repopulation, once they've fully decomposed and the vultures have done their work .      › PMQs review: Cameron's surprise pledge not to raise VAT floors Miliband        Ian Steadman is a staff science and technology writer at the New Statesman .

		else{?    Everything about Freya Farrington is glamorous. With long blonde hair and immaculate make-up, the full-time YouTuber films her videos in her pristine silver-and-white home. By talking to the camera about beauty, fashion, and meeting Justin Bieber “a couple of times” in Barbados, Freya has gained 12,000 subscribers in less than a year. But once a month – “every month” – the 26-year-old uploads a video you might not expect. A Poundland Haul. In the last year, 166,000 Poundland Hauls have been uploaded onto YouTube. In 2007, “haul videos” became exceptionally popular on the video-sharing site, with YouTubers showing off their latest purchases. Traditionally, hauls were high-end – vloggers filmed make-up, clothes, and expensive gadgets – but now, Poundland is the new Prada.      “At what point did all the beauty and lifestyle vloggers stop going to Gucci and Selfridges and start doing Poundland hauls??” asked one Twitter user earlier this month. A popular YouTuber with over 2.6m subscribers, Louise Pentland , also recently tweeted that she was “OB-SESSED” with the budget videos. Pentland’s own Poundland haul is the most-watched of the genre, with 283,593 views. Despite lasting over 12 minutes, the vlogger only spent £32.20 on products for the Christmas video (a far cry from the £792.21 worth of clothing shown in a recent Zoella haul ).      These videos find fans beyond YouTube, and there are over 13,000 members in a “Poundland Appreciation Society” Facebook group. “Please share your Poundland-related YouTube videos on the wall,” read the group’s rules, “Please do not post NON-Poundland videos to the wall.” What explains the trend? YouTubers have traditionally been aspirational, while Poundland traditionally hasn’t. Is this a symptom of austerity Britain? A backlash against YouTube consumerism? Does Poundland have an exceptionally proactive and successful PR? “They are definitely one of the most popular videos I film, second to Primark Hauls,” says Manchester-based Freya, who describes herself as a “bargain lover”.  “I always create content that I'd love to watch myself and Poundland hauls are one that I will always watch when YouTubers I follow upload,” she explains. “I take inspiration from the things you can make from affordable prices.”      A 2017 survey by auctioneers Pro Auction found that the average British person spends nine months of their lives bargain hunting, which typically works out at two hours a week. Rather than a symptom of societal change, Poundland Hauls could be popular because of an age-old love of bargain-hunting. Social media has removed any stigma some may have previously felt for bargain shopping, as people can find like-minded others on YouTube and Facebook.  Much is made of social media being “too” aspirational: generating unrealistic expectations, causing jealousy and depression, and showing off “highlight reels”. The rise of Poundland Hauls demonstrates a taste for the achievable over the aspirational, and a love of realistic, down-to-earth content. With over 75 per cent of children considering a career in vlogging , these hauls are also an accessible way for young people to start their own YouTube channels. In Freya's latest Poundland Haul, the blogger begins the video by showing off kitchen roll and toilet roll. She then showcases popcorn, a Terry's Chocolate Orange, rice cakes, three planters, two umbrellas, and 18 dishwasher tablets. In recent years, there has been a huge backlash over fakery in the YouTube community, with fans "exposing" YouTubers for Photoshopping, selling out, and outright lying. YouTube Poundland Hauls are an unobtrusive, simple form of video that make no pretences, perhaps explaining the genre's popularity. In the time it took to write this article, four more have been uploaded to the site.

By Beulah Maud Devaney       The undead take part in a traditional Zombie Walk in Stockholm, in August 2014. Image: Getty.   The received wisdom is that, once the dead rise and walk the earth, city dwellers won’t stand a chance. We’re too self-obsessed to notice the bloody handprints on our neighbour’s door. Polluted drinking water, feral lap dogs, roving gangs: it’ll all conspire against us, and we’ll be zombie fodder within a couple of hours. Rather than stay in our death-trap cities, the default advice for urbanites is to retreat to a perfectly stocked and secluded rural retreat. But what if I don’t want to leave my cosy apartment and collection of carefully neglected houseplants, only to die of exposure in a hedge? Is staying in the city really Darwin Award-worthy or could it actually improve our chances of survival? The question of whether city-dwellers stand a chance in a zombie strewn world was tackled in October 2015 by CareerBuilder and labour data source EMSI. Their researchers developed the Zombie Apocalypse Index (ZAI), which looks at which US cities would survive a zombie outbreak.    The ZAI works on the assumption that every US citizen is either a member of the armed forces or owns multiple guns. But for those of us who don’t have a sawn-off shotgun stashed in the biscuit tin, a different set of criteria will determine our survival. Population density, housing, government funding, crime rates, geographical location and cycling infrastructure (bear with me) will all play a role in determining which UK cities survive a zombie outbreak.  Potential for total isolation  During the first wave of an outbreak, when zombies and future zombies are clogging up the local infrastructure, the city-dweller’s best chance of surviving is to behave like they’ve got a terrible hangover. Those weekends when you don’t leave your apartment and start talking to the plug sockets and wondering if the entire outside world is Schrodingers Cat? That’s your life now. Once you’ve stacked your cupboards with baked beans and topped up the Netflix account, survival is possible for the most entrenched city-dweller. For a while at least. Assuming Deliveroo doesn’t survive the apocalypse, at some point you’re going to have to forage for food, and this is where total isolation starts working against cities. Those closest to natural sources of food (the coast, rivers, forests, the yogurt sample cart outside King's Cross station) will be fine. Ish. City-dwellers living more than a day's travel from the wild will probably have to move apartments – a stressful enough activity when the undead aren’t attempting to crack open your skull – or start developing a taste for pigeon.  Population density  A city’s survival rate can usually be tied to its population: the more people living there today, the more undead walking the streets tomorrow. Working out the largest UK city is surprisingly difficult , but if we’re going by the number of future brain munchers currently in residence, London comes out top with 8.5m. Meanwhile Preston, Oxford, Peterborough, York and Portsmouth all look like safe bets, with populations comfortably below 200,000.    The zombies take Sydney. Image: Getty.  Survival isn’t just how low or spread out your population is, however – and those of us living in densely populated cities still have a chance. Highly populated cities tend to have more apartment blocks and apartments are easier to defend than houses (more people, more food, staircases, etc). It’s also harder for people outside the building to steal your supplies. And speaking of crime...  Budget cuts  In The Zombie Survival Guide , zombie-handler Max Brooks points out that:  “Buildings in poorer, inner-city neighbourhoods tend to be more secure than others. Their reliance on high fences, razor wire, barred windows, and other anti-crime features make them readily defensible. Buildings in middle– or high-income areas tend to emphasize aesthetics... if the situation permits; head away from the suburbs and toward the inner city.”  George Osborne’s decision to remove the central government grant in April 2016 will leave local councils facing a £18bn cut in funding. In response many cities are talking about closing libraries, museums, parks and community centres. What critics are failing to appreciate, however, is that these neglected facilities will be perfectly placed to take advantage of a zombie apocalypse. Bare bones investment in public buildings now will lead to impenetrable fortresses on Z-Day.  Health care  Aside from population and (lack of) government funding, health care plays the biggest role in deciding a city’s survival rate. Hospitals were an important part of the ZAI, with Boston topping the league thanks to its “cure zone”. As the US city that has received the highest rate of medical funding, Boston has the best chance of containing and eventually curing an outbreak.   Some zombies on a water bus in Venice. No, really. Image: Getty. Unfortunately, due to a dramatic lack of investment in UK hospitals, the ZAI is unlikely to work for us. In fact, Brooks cites medical staff as the reason most zombie-outbreaks spread so quickly. They’re overworked, vulnerable to infection and surrounded by reanimating bodies. Bearing this in mind, hospitals and health centres are a delicate balancing act. You want enough of them to loot once the first zombie wave is over, but not enough that you’ll be fenced in by the undead. Basically, if Jeremy Hunt has closed half your city’s hospitals but kept the other half open with a skeleton (ho ho ho) staffs, you’re sitting pretty.  Cycling infrastructure  If I’ve learnt one thing from years lurking on survival forums (other than the fact that it is possible to drink you own urine three times before it loses all nutritional value) it’s that cycling is my default mode of post-apocalypse transport. A bike is the only vehicle that it’s possible for humans to carry around obstacles (unless you want to be the person using a Segway to run away from zombies). They also help maintain fitness, require no fuel, make very little noise and are easy to repair. Post-zombfest car drivers (still) aren’t going to be paying attention to cycle lane markings, but living in a city with cycling infrastructure will help survivors. Cities with cycling schemes are effectively gifting survivors with multiple cycling options, and studies show that good cycling infrastructure encourages citizens to buy their own bikes. All that means more bikes to be looted once the cycling scheme runs out. Game on.  Follow us on Twitter and/or Facebook for more tips on urban living at the end of the world.

Image: Getty.   On Sunday, home secretary Amber Rudd argued that the “biggest driver” of rising violent crime was the illegal drugs market. The growth of so-called county lines gangs, often recruiting young children to transport drugs around the country, is fuelling our £5.3bn black market in cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, and more. The violence of crimes from drug gangs is spreading outwards from our cities, with an estimated 4,000 teenagers in London alone caught up in smuggling operations. Between 2014-15 and 2016-17, the share of homicides where either victim or suspect was a drug user or dealer increased from 50 per cent to 57 per cent. Competition among drug dealers has reached such a high level that some are offering loyalty cards for repeat customers. But as politicians across the ideological spectrum discuss Band-Aid measures like tougher restrictions on buying acid and banning home deliveries of knives, the elephant in the room is our failed policy of drug prohibition.    In its recently-released Serious Violence Strategy , the Home Office inadvertently diagnoses many problems of prohibition. It correctly highlights that “grievances in illicit drug markets cannot be settled through legal channels, so participants may settle them violently. This can lead to escalation as dealers seek to portray themselves as excessively violent.” But this is entirely avoidable: the Home Office goes on to say that “violence can be used as a way of maintaining and increasing profits within drugs markets”. In other words, the escalation happens because drugs are illegal and unregulated. Gangs are sophisticated businesses, with strong incentives to keep their clients involved and those in their control under their thumb. Gangs in our largest cities run weapons and trafficking operations across the country. They use income from the drugs trade to finance their lifestyles, and the need to protect this feeds the firearms they trade – as seen in Liverpool where the Anfield gang jailed last year were found to be running the country’s second largest combined gun, drug and people trafficking operation with activity in rural Cheshire, Lancashire and even down to the South Coast. The violence these gangs create is entirely the result of forcing such markets underground. Legal, regulated alcohol companies solve their disputes through competition in the marketplace, and the courts if necessary. Illegal, unregulated drug gangs often solve their disputes by the less formal methods of murdering and robbing each other. And when police bust one gang, the resulting power vacuum can lead to heightened violence as those remaining vie for dominance. Economic evidence suggests that the introduction of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) in the USA led to a decrease in violent crime in states that border Mexico, and more wide-reaching liberalisation will have even greater effects. But it’s not just turf wars between rival gangs that disappear under legalisation. Problem drug users are free to seek treatment without fear of arrest; campaigners are currently calling for drug consumption rooms in London , Glasgow , and elsewhere. They are also less likely to fund their habit through theft. Washington State’s decision to legalise cannabis in November 2012 caused a reduction in thefts of between 13 per cent and 22 per cent . Property crime is likely to plummet if other drugs were legalised and regulated according to relative harm levels: official figures show that nearly half of shoplifting, thefts, robberies and burglaries are committed by regular heroin and crack cocaine users. Recreational users are also less likely to face violent crime. You don’t tend to get robbed at knifepoint purchasing alcohol in an off-licence, but buying cannabis in a dark alley is a different matter. Parents would no longer have to worry about the possibility that their teenage children are getting into cars with complete strangers in order to buy drugs, and any dealers who survive their market being swept away from them would face a police force with far greater resources to put them behind bars. Last week, David Lammy MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, “The police and our country has lost control of [the] drugs market.” He’s right – but more prohibition and more police on the beat won’t solve the problem of rising violent crime. The definition of insanity is continually doing the same thing and expecting different results. But we needn’t. The state is imposing the spillover cost of violence onto estates in our cities and onto the young people caught up in gang warfare. It has the ability to take this power away from gangs and become a world leader in harm reduction. The only way to gain control of the drugs market is to make it legal and regulated.
