Megan Alcalay   Health           Did you know? Medical procedures amount to 96% of man-made radiation that humans are exposed to. Wow. Studies show that radiation exposure from imaging tests, like x-rays or CT scans, is never safe. Yet, these tests provide valuable information about your health, and allow your physician to make accurate diagnoses. X-rays and CT scans are necessary tools in medicine... they are also classified as carcinogens. X-ray medical tests have been around for 120 years, when it was discovered that producing a concentrated beam of electrons through the body onto metal film resulted in an internal image of the body. CT scans were developed in the 1970’s and consist of multiple x-rays and thus significantly higher radiation exposure. The radiation emitted during these procedures is called ionizing radiation – radiation with so much energy, that during interaction with an atom, removes electrons from the atom’s orbit. The atom becomes charged or ionized. When this occurs within the human body, the cell either dies, repairs itself, or mutates incorrectly and can become cancerous. Your Normal Medical Exposure and Associated Risk Numerous studies have validated the positive correlation between radiation exposure and cancer risk. Based on these studies, the FDA estimates that exposure to 10 millisieverts (mSv) from an x-ray or CT scan increases the risk of death from cancer by 1 in 2000 (.05%) , a relatively small amount. According to cancer.org , a “study in England of exposure to radiation from CT scans found that children who received a dose of at least 30 mSv to the bone marrow had 3 times the risk of leukemia compared to those who received a dose of 5 mSv or less. For brain tumors, a dose of 50 mSv or more to the brain was linked to more than 3 times the risk.” The average radiation exposure per x-ray is .28 mSv . You would need approximately 36 x-rays throughout your lifetime to raise your risk of cancer by .05% . The average radiation exposure per CT scan is 6.3 mSv . After approximately two CT scans, your risk of cancer increases by .05% . CT scans are far more risky than x-rays, yet they are a noninvasive way to study all parts of the body and assist doctors in diagnosing and treating vascular diseases, cancer, spinal problems, internal injuries, trauma and more. [Note: MRI’s, another common diagnostic tool, do not use ionizing radiation. ] Some Perspective – Airport Scanners The most common airport scanners – the old-school metal detectors and new-school millimeter scanners (the plastic booth) – do not use ionizing radiation . Backscatter scanners (where you stand between the two boxes) average between 0.00005 to 0.0001 mSv per scan. You would need 1,000 to 2,000 airport (backscatter) scans to get a dose equivalent to a single chest x-ray ! Is there a definitive threshold where x-rays go from safe to dangerous? Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. There is no scientifically validated number of x-rays or CT scans that you are granted in your lifetime without risk of harm. Each test varies in its levels of emitted radiation, and tissues and organs vary in sensitivity to the radiation exposure. But, here’s a very helpful chart that provides details about common imaging tests and their corresponding effective radiation doses. The Bottom Line | TL;DR To optimize your longevity and vitality, we recommend avoiding known carcinogens, including radiation, whenever possible . We encourage you to be informed about your tests, understand how much lifetime medical radiation you’ve been exposed to, and be cautious and inquisitive with young children and radiation exposure. However, remember it takes almost 40 x-rays or two CT scans to increase your risk of cancer by .05%. When requested by a physician as a medical tool, you shouldn’t be scared of medical x-rays or CT scans as a cancer risk . Take Initiative With Medical Radiation Ask questions. Ask your physician why an imaging test will help them determine your treatment. If your doctor explains why it is needed, do not refuse an x-ray or CT scan. In many situations, the risk of not getting a scan (and thus proper treatment) far outweighs the risk of the radiation exposure. Don’t insist on an x-ray or CT scan. Sometimes physicians will order an x-ray because their patient insists on one. Don’t be this patient. Allow your physician to do their job. If you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Radiation exposure is riskier to an unborn baby than to an adult. If pregnant and in need of an imaging test, clearly understand the risks and ask if there are ways to protect the developing fetus. Ask if a gonad shield can be used. Often there are ways to shield the more sensitive tissues and organs. Stay informed to minimize your cancer risk. We are surrounded by carcinogens. There is no scientific evidence enabling us to pinpoint exactly what will keep us healthy and what will make us ill. However, study after study points to actions we can take daily to maintain harmony in our environment, from lifestyle choices, to diet and stress reduction.

Radiation from the Environment  Background radiation  Background radiation refers to radiation that naturally occurs in our environment and does not come from any manufactured devices.  Radiation is emitted from the earth, sun, our galaxy, and other galaxies.  Even the human body naturally contains some radioactive elements. 8  People who receive few or no high-dose radiation medical tests usually get more exposure to radiation from the natural environment than from any manufactured device. 9  This is because we are constantly exposed to a very low dose radiation for our whole lives, while devices such as x-ray tests expose you to radiation for a very short period of time.  On the other hand, one CT scan can be equal to several years of background radiation exposures, so many people receive much higher doses of radiation from medical devices than they do from the natural environment.  The risk of developing cancer from a lifetime exposure of background radiation is about 1 in 100, or 1% of the population. 10 It is impossible to avoid all background radiation, but the best ways to limit unnecessary exposure to radiation from the environment is to prevent your exposure to radon and repeated unprotected sun exposure.  Radon  Radon is a color less, odorless gas that comes from decaying rocks and soil.  For the average person, radon accounts for over half their annual exposure to radiation.  Radon comes up from the ground and gets trapped in houses and buildings.  Exposure to a small amount of radon inside is normal, but high levels can cause lung cancer.  Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer (smoking is the leading cause), and approximately 1 in every 15 houses have too much radon.  The only way to know if you have a safe level of radon in your house is to get it tested. 11  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation is radiation that comes from the galaxy and from the earth.  It makes up about 8% of our average yearly exposure to radiation. 12 Cosmic radiation includes ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun that cause tans and sunburns.  UV rays can also damage the DNA in our skin cells and lead to skin cancer. 13 Although we cannot avoid UV rays all the time, limiting exposure to direct sun light can reduce your risk of skin cancer.  Tanning beds are also a common source of UV radiation and are just as dangerous as radiation from the sun.  For more information on tanning beds, please read: Tanning Beds: Safe Alternative to Sun?  Being at higher altitudes, such as flying on a plane or living in a “mile high” location, will exposure you to higher levels of cosmic radiation than being at sea level.  While there is technically no “safe” dose of ionizing radiation, the chances of getting cancer from frequent plane trips is very slim.  Studies of airline crew members have not found a significant increase in risk of cancer after many years of working on airplane. 14  In addition, living in Denver or other high altitude locations that receive higher doses of cosmic radiation has not been shown to increase the risk of cancer. 15   How to Reduce Radiation Exposure from the Environment  Radon :  Test the level of radon inside your house to make sure it is not too high.  You can hire a professional to do this or you can purchase a “do-it-yourself” radon testing kit.  It generally takes only a few minutes and is easy to do.  If there is too high a level of radon in your house, people usually install an active soil depressurization (ASD) system, which is basically a ventilation system. 2  UV Radiation: Some of the best ways to reduce your exposure to harmful UV rays are to:   Wear sunscreen (at least SPF 15) year-round in all areas of your body that are exposed to the sun. (However, it is good to get vitamin D from the sun for 15 minutes each day.)  Stay in the shade, especially when the sun is at it’s strongest (between 10am and 4pm)  Wear protective clothing, such as broad-brimmed hats and tightly-woven clothes that cover your hands and legs.    Medical Devices that Use Radiation  X-rays  X-rays use ionizing radiation and are used for many types of diagnostic tests such as CT scans, mammograms, fluoroscopy, and simple x-rays.  These tests allow your doctor to see potential problems inside your body and choose an appropriate treatment.  They can help doctors make life-saving decisions, but some doctors are performing unnecessary scans or are using doses of radiation that are too high. 16 Since x-rays use ionizing radiation, they can cause damage to our cells and DNA. X-ray tests can lead to cancer, but several common tests (such as mammograms and bone x-rays) use very low doses that have not been shown to cause a significant increased risk of cancer when administered properly.  Over the past few decades, the average level of radiation that Americans are exposed to has increased rapidly due to increased use of medical diagnostic tests such as x-rays (including dental x-rays and mammograms) and CT scans and cancer treatments.  Diagnostic tests and treatments can help improve patients’ quality and length of life, but there are also risks.  Usually, the benefit of receiving one of these tests outweighs the risk, but patients and doctors need to be wary of performing unnecessary tests, particularly if the test uses high doses of radiation.  Not all imaging tests use radiation that has been linked to cancer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) and ultrasounds do not use x-rays.  Instead, they use non-ionizing radiation and have not been found to increase the risk of cancer or other health problems. 17  MRIs and Ultrasounds are a safer alternative to diagnostics tests that use x-rays or other ionizing radiation.  Children, young adults, and fetuses of pregnant women should be particularly careful about getting any x-ray tests.  Children, young adults, and fetuses are more sensitive to radiation, and their young age also allows a longer period of time for cancer to develop. 18 , 19 , 20  Pregnant women should avoid any x-ray exposure, particularly when they are less than 20 weeks pregnant, since radiation exposure in the womb can lead to mental retardation, growth retardation, leukemia, and other cancers later in life. 21 If it is necessary for a pregnant women to be x-rayed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states a single x-ray test does not harm the fetus, but a protective lead apron should be used to cover the abdomen. 22 However, high-dose, multiple-dose, or x-rays of the pelvic region should be avoided for pregnant women, whenever possible.  Many people get simple x-ray tests, such as an arm, leg, chest, or dental x-ray that look for broken bones or other problems.  Simple x-ray tests use very low doses of radiation, 23   and studies have not found an increase risk of cancer among humans who have received a very low dose of radiation. 24 Although the dose of radiation used to x-ray different parts of the body will vary, most simple x-rays use less radiation than other types of x-ray scans (such as a mammogram or CT scan).  Mammograms  Mammograms are an x-ray test that is used to detect breast cancer.  This test uses a higher dose of radiation than a simple x-ray, but less than a CT scan or Fluoroscopy.  According to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, a woman above age 50 who is at average risk of breast cancer should get a mammogram test once every two years  until age 74 . 25 These new guidelines would expose women to less than half the amount of radiation from mammograms than following previous recommendations (which included annual mammograms starting at age 40 for women at average risk).  While these doses of radiation could cause new cases of breast cancer, the appropriate use of mammograms has resulted in lives saved, and the benefits of getting regular mammograms are likely to be even greater than the risks when the frequency of mammograms is reduced to every other year.  Women who are carriers of the BRCA genetic mutation were previously recommended to begin yearly mammograms at age 25-30, since this mutation puts them at much higher risk of getting breast cancer.  Newer studies have found that starting yearly mammograms before age 35 has no benefit to these women and may instead be harmful.  They end up with higher exposure to radiation over their lifetime, which increases the chance of getting radiation-induced breast cancer that they may not have gotten otherwise. 26  Fluoroscopy  Fluoroscopyis an x-ray test that allows doctors to see a continuous x-ray image of your body (like a movie, rather than just a picture as with other x-ray tests).  Fluoroscopy uses an x-ray absorbing dye that is either drunk or injected into the body, which allows doctors to see a better outline of the organ.  This procedure is used to view the digestive system (such as stomach, kidneys, or colon), arteries, or joints. 27  Since this test sends x-ray beams over an extended period of time (usually 20-60 minutes), 28 it exposes people to much higher doses of radiation than a simple x-ray test, although the doses vary widely depending on the test.  Fluoroscopy and CT scans both use high doses of radiation and pose the greatest and most avoidable risk of radiation-induced cancer.  Limiting the number of CT and fluoroscopy tests you receive is one of the best ways you can avoid getting cancer from radiation.  In addition to increasing cancer risk, this test can damage the skin and cause burns. 29  Computed Tomographic (CT) scans  CT Scans are a relatively new type of diagnostic imaging technology that allows doctors to view 3-dimentional pictures of various organs in your body.  CT scans use higher doses of radiation than most other types of diagnostic test and are likely to cause new cancers in some patients, compared to their risk if they had not received a CT scan.  Today, an American’s average lifetime dose of radiation from diagnostic procedures is six times higher than it was in the 1980s. 30 This is largely due to the increased use of CT scans. Everyday, 19,500 CT scans are performed in the U.S. and this number continues to climb. Each CT scan is equivalent to 30 – 442 chest x-rays, depending on the dose used for the CT scan. 31 One study projected that CT scans performed in the U.S. in 2007 alone will result in 29,000 new cancer cases and roughly 15,000 deaths that would not have occurred if they had not received a CT scan. 32 These risks would increase with each additional CT scan a person receives.  Low-dose CT scans, which expose patients to less radiation, are now being used to screen for lung cancer, with concerns about whether the benefits outweigh the risks.  For more information on low-dose CTs, click here .  Unfortunately, there is no established guideline for how much radiation should be used for each procedure.  Different scans require different levels of radiation in order to get a clear image, but some doctors are using more radiation than is necessary.  One study found that different medical facilities had huge variations in the dose of radiation used for the same procedure.  On average, the highest dose given for a CT scan was 13 times higher than the lowest does given for the same type of scan. 33 The researchers found no pattern in why this dose variation occurred, and no scientific justification.  Children’s exposure to radiation from CT scans is particularly worrisome because children have many more years to develop cancer than adults receiving CT scans and are more sensitive to the effects of radiation.  A June 2012 study found that children receiving higher doses of radiation — through multiple CT scans– were more likely to develop brain tumors and leukemia than children who had only one CT scan. 34 However, brain tumors and leukemia are very rare conditions and the increased risk due to CT scans was relatively small: for every 10,000 CT scans performed on children under 10 years-old, there will be one additional diagnosis of leukemia and one additional diagnosis of a brain tumor. The researchers concluded that the benefits of children having necessary CT scans outweighed the risks of later developing cancer.  A study published in May 2013 looked at children from infancy to 19 years of age in Australia and compared those who had undergone CT scans to those who had never had any. 35 Ten years after getting scanned,  there were 24% more cases of cancer among  the 680,000 children and teenagers who had CT scans than among the 10 million children and teenagers who did not undergo CT scans. Young people who had CT scans during the 12-month period before being diagnosed with cancer were not counted because the decision to scan them may have had to do with cancer symptoms.  Children 4 and under had the highest increased risk in cancer, and risk for all increased with the number of scans. The researchers concluded that for every 1,800 people under 20 who had a CT scan, there was 1 additional case of cancer that would not have occurred without the radiation from the CT scan. The CT scans in this study took place between 1985 and 2005 when radiation doses where generally higher than they are today.  Parents should make sure that CT scans ordered for their children are medically necessary and ask their doctors if lower-radiation alternatives exist. While parents should not stop their children from receiving a necessary CT scan because of radiation concerns, they should think about keeping the number of scans below age 20 to a minimum.  The FDA and investigative journalists have also released warnings about occurrence of extreme accidental overdoses of radiation from CT scans. 36 , 37  In January 2010, the FDA reported that over 250 patients at 4 facilities had received as much as 8 times the amount of radiation that they were supposed to receive. 38 Accidental radiation overdoses can result in skin redness, hair loss, increased risk of various cancers and cataracts in the future, and death.  While extreme overdoses of radiation are rare, these avoidable mistakes have lead many health professionals to call for more standardized and comprehensive methods of overseeing medical radiation. 39  ( Click here for more information on heart CT scans and cancer risk ).  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans  PET scans differ from other types of diagnostic imaging in that they allow doctors to see how an organ or system is functioning rather than just seeing the structure .  This test works in a very different way than other tests and does not use x-rays-rather, it uses gamma rays, which usually have a higher level of energy than x-rays.  PET scans work by injecting (or swallowing) small amounts of radioactive material, which then spreads throughout the body. The PET scanner is then used to detect the radiation that is emitting from the radioactive material in your body. Procedures that use radioactive material to diagnose and treat patients is referred to as “nuclear medicine.” 40  The dose of radiation from a PET scan is similar to CT, and therefore exposes people to a relatively high dose of radiation in comparison to other types of scans.  Using Radiation to Treat Cancer:  Radiation therapy  Radiation therapy uses high doses of radiation to treat various types of cancers.  Beams of radiation are directed at the cancer to kill off cancerous cells.  This can save lives and prevent recurrence of cancer, but healthy cells that are exposed to radiation may develop into a new cancer.  Fortunately, new cancers caused by radiation therapy are not thought to be very common since radiation technology can precisely irradiate a small part of the body that contains cancer, minimizing the amount of healthy cells that are exposed to radiation. 41  Another concern about radiation therapy and diagnostic tests are errors in using this technology. Although relatively uncommon, some patients will accidently receive doses that are too high.  In addition to being at increased risk of developing cancer in the future, the incorrect doses can cause serious wounds to the skin, bone, and other organs, as well as death. 42 , 43  Between 1950 and 2006, the frequency of diagnostic radiation increased 10-fold. 44 As health professionals continue to find new uses for medical devices that use radiation, people will be exposed to radiation more often. For example, many radiologists have recently started promoting the use of CT scans to screen for colon cancer (known as a virtual colonoscopy), although the FDA has not approved CT scans for this purpose. 45  Although many patients would prefer this non-invasive procedure over the traditional direct examinations, it would expose people to high doses of radiation that is roughly equal to 100 chest x-rays (or 3 years of background radiation. 46 This means more people are likely to be diagnosed with cancers that are caused by radiation than they would not have gotten otherwise.  Other Manufactured Devices that Use Radiation  Airport and Building X-ray Scans  Backscatter and millimeter scanners have begun replacing metal detectors and are designed to scan a person to determine what weapons or explosives they may have beneath their clothing. Currently, there are about 250 backscatter and 264 millimeter wave scanners in the United States. The TSA hopes to have 1,800 scanners of either type installed by the end of 2014 – which would mean that nearly every airport in the country will have one.  Backscatter scanners look like two large blue boxes:  (Source: Transportation Security Administration)  People raise their arms and stand sideways between these two boxes when they are scanned.  In contrast, millimeter wave scanners look like circular glass phone booths, and the person being scanned stands with their arms raised while part of the scanner rotates around them:  (Source: Transportation Security Administration, from http://www.tsa.gov/videos/travel-tips-advanced-imaging-technology)  If you are not sure which scanner is in use at your airport, ask a TSA official at the security checkpoint.  While metal detectors and millimeter scans both use non-ionizing radiation, which until recently was assumed to be safe (see our article Can Cell Phones Harm our Health? ), backscatter scans use ionizing radiation, which is used in x-rays and known to potentially increase the risk of cancer. Backscatter scans work a little differently from x-rays. X-rays work by sending high-energy radiation to the body and recording the radiation that passes through the body. Dense parts of the body (like bones) block some of the radiation, resulting in lighter areas on the recorded image.  Backscatter scanners also send radiation toward the body, but at much lower energy than an x-ray. Because it is not as strong as the radiation used in x-rays, the radiation does not pass through the body. Instead, the outer layers of the body “scatter” the radiation, which bounces off the body and back toward the machine. People receive most of the radiation that is absorbed by the body is deposited in the outer layers (like the skin and ribs), although a 2012 study showed that radiation from these scans may penetrate to other organs. 47 Because the radiation is concentrated in the skin, there are concerns that this could cause skin cancer.  All data on backscatter scans are provided by TSA, a government agency that does not allow independent researchers to examine the machines they use. 48 Researchers must therefore make educated guesses using data provided by the TSA, or they must make models of the scanners based on information that the agency releases.  The TSA states that backscatter scans use such low doses of radiation that estimating the potential effects of the scan is extremely difficult. 49 , 50 A 2011 report using information from the TSA found that these backscatter scans expose people to the same amount of radiation that they receive from 3 to 9 minutes of normal daily life or from 1 to 3 minutes of flight. 51 To put this into perspective, we would expect only 6 of the 100 million airline passengers each year to develop a cancer in their entire lives due to the backscatter scans.  Dr. David Brenner, a researcher at Columbia University, produced a different estimate based on the risk that the scanners are to the entire population, not just to an individual. 52 Dr. Brenner multiplied the risk associated with one scan by the number of scans conducted each year to estimate the number of people who may develop cancer in one year because of the scanners. Because up to one billion scans may be performed each year, Brenner estimated that each year 100 people would develop cancer because of their exposure.  In April 2010, a group of scientists from the University of California, San Francisco wrote a letter of concern to Dr. John Holdren, the Assistant to President Obama for Science and Technology, about the backscatter scans. These researchers pointed out that because backscatter scans only penetrate outer layers of the body, it is possible that these layers receive a higher concentration of radiation than previously believed.  The scientists also expressed concern that sperm may mutate because the testicles are close to the surface of the skin and are exposed to radiation during these backscatter scans. In addition, they noted that the effects of radiation on the cornea (the outer surface of the eye) and the thymus (a part of the immune system located in the chest) have not been studied. While this letter only outlined concerns of the scientists and did not present new data, it called for further testing of backscatter scans.  The scientists called for more rigorous and independent studies to ensure that the scans are safe for the entire population, as well as for all parts of the body.  In a joint reply with the TSA, the FDA stated that the radiation exposures from the backscatter scans were within established legal limits, even for frequent fliers. 53 In reply to the scientists’ concerns that the radiation dose to the skin would be higher, the FDA wrote that their calculations showed that a person would have to pass through the scanner 1000 times in a year in order to begin to absorb the annual limit of what is considered safe. 54  Not everyone agrees with the FDA, and some people have pointed out that TSA agents operating the scanners may improperly manage the devices or that mechanical errors may occur, either of which could cause the machines to emit more radiation than they are supposed to. From May 2010 to May 2011, there were 3,778 calls for mechanical problems on backscatter machines, but only 2% of those machines were evaluated for radiation safety. 55  For a more in-depth look at airport security and radiation, read here .  Microwaves, Cell Phones, and Other Manufactured Devices  There is still much debate among scientists about whether non-ionizing (low-energy) radiation such as microwaves can increase your risk of cancer or other health problems. The concern is not about microwave ovens, but rather the long-term exposures to microwaves from other sources, such as communication towers and cell phones. 56 Cell phones emit very low doses of microwave radiation, which was long assumed to be safe.  Although generally safer than ionizing radiation, the much longer-term exposure could make these products potentially dangerous. There are studies indicating that long-term exposures to low doses of non-ionizing radiation can damage DNA and may cause cancers and neurological and reproductive harm. 57 , 58  The rapid increase in use of cell phones and other wireless devices intensifies the need for further research on potential health effects of these non-ionizing radiation sources. Click here to get more information on cell phones and health.  Tobacco, fertilizer, welding rods, smoke detectors, and several other consumer products also contain some radiation, but radiation from these sources is generally very low (approximately 3% of our yearly radiation dose.

The accumulated exposure to 1 rem [10 mSv] of radiation, would increase that number to about 2005 or 2006.” [33]  All articles are reviewed and approved by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and other senior staff.

Signs and Symptoms of Bone Cancer    Tests for Bone Cancer    Bone Cancer Stages    Survival Statistics for Bone Cancer    Questions To Ask About Bone Cancer             Bone Cancer  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging             Tests for Bone Cancer      Symptoms, a physical exam, and the results of imaging tests , and blood tests might suggest that a person has bone cancer . But in most cases, doctors must confirm this  by testing a tissue or cell sample and checking it with a microscope (a procedure known as a biopsy ).  Accurate diagnosis of a bone tumor often depends on combining information about what bone is affected and which part of the bone is involved, how it looks on x-rays, and what the cells look like under a microscope.   Other diseases, like bone infections, can cause symptoms and imaging results that might be confused with bone cancer.  Bone metastasis can also look like primary bone cancer. Bone tumors are more often caused by cancer that has spread to the bone from some other part of the body. This is a bone metastasis. A single bone metastasis can have the same signs and symptoms as a primary bone tumor, so many doctors require a biopsy to diagnose a patient’s first bone metastasis. After that, new bone metastases can usually be diagnosed based on x-rays and other imaging tests.  Imaging tests  X-rays  Most bone cancers show up on x-rays of the bone. The bone at the site of the cancer may look “ragged” instead of solid. The cancer can also appear as a hole in the bone. Sometimes doctors can see a tumor around the defect in the bone that might extend into nearby tissues (such as muscle or fat). The radiologist (doctor who specializes in reading x-rays) can often tell if a tumor is malignant by the way it appears on the x-ray, but only a biopsy can tell for sure.  A chest x-ray is often done to see if bone cancer has spread to the lungs.  Computed tomography (CT) scans  CT scans are helpful in staging cancer . They help show if the bone cancer has spread to your lungs, liver, or other organs. The scans show the lymph nodes and distant organs where there might be cancer spread.  CT scans can also be used to guide a biopsy needle into a tumor. This is called a CT-guided needle biopsy. For this test, you stay on the CT scanning table while a radiologist moves a biopsy needle toward the tumor. CT scans are repeated until the tip of the needle is within the mass. (See Needle biopsy below.)  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans  MRI scans are often the best test for outlining a bone tumor. They are very helpful for looking at the brain and spinal cord.  Radionuclide bone scans  Bone scans can show if a cancer has spread to other bones. It can find smaller areas of metastasis than regular x-rays. Bone scans also can show how much damage the cancer has caused in the bone.  Areas of diseased bone will be seen on the bone scan as dense, gray to black areas, called “hot spots.” These areas suggest  cancer is present, but arthritis, infection, or other bone diseases can also cause hot spots. Other imaging tests or a bone biopsy may be needed to know what's causing the change.  Positron emission tomography (PET or PET) scans  PET scans use glucose (a form of sugar) that's attached to a radioactive atom. A special camera can detect the radioactivity. Cancer cells absorb a lot of the radioactive sugar because of their high rate of metabolism. PET scans are useful in looking for cancer throughout your entire body. It can sometimes help tell if a tumor is cancer or not cancer (benign). It's often combined with CT scans to better pinpoint some kinds of cancer.  Biopsy  A biopsy takes a piece of tissue  from a tumor so that it can be looked at with a microscope and tested in the lab. This is the only way to know that the tumor is cancer and not another bone disease.  If it is cancer, the biopsy can tell the doctor if it's a primary bone cancer or cancer that started somewhere else and spread to the bone (metastasis). Many  types of tissue and cell samples are used to diagnose bone cancer. It's very important that your biopsy be done by a surgeon with experience in diagnosing and treating bone tumors.  The type of biopsy done is based on whether the tumor looks benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer) and exactly what type of tumor it most likely is (based on  x-rays, the patient’s age, and where the tumor is). Some kinds of bone tumors can be diagnosed from needle biopsy samples, but larger samples (from a surgical biopsy) are often needed to diagnose other types.  Whether the surgeon plans to remove the entire tumor during the  biopsy will also impact the type of biopsy done. Sometimes the wrong kind of biopsy can  make it hard  for the surgeon to later remove all of the cancer without having to also remove all or part of the arm or leg containing the tumor. It also may cause the cancer to spread.  Needle biopsy  There are 2 types of needle biopsies: fine (aspiration) and core . For both types, a drug is first used to numb the area for the biopsy.  For fine needle aspiration (FNA), the doctor uses a very thin needle and a syringe to take out a small amount of fluid and some cells from the tumor. Sometimes, the doctor can aim the needle by feeling the  tumor if it's near the surface of the body. If the tumor  is too deep to feel, the doctor can guide the needle while looking a CT scan. This is called a CT guided needle biopsy and it is often done by an x-ray specialist known as an interventional radiologist.  In a core needle biopsy , the doctor uses a larger needle to remove a small cylinder of tissue (about 1/16 inch in diameter and 1/2 inch long). Many experts feel that a core needle biopsy is better than FNA to diagnose a primary bone cancer.  Surgical bone biopsy  In this procedure, a surgeon needs to cut through the skin to reach the tumor  to remove a small piece of tissue. This is also called an incisional biopsy . If the entire tumor is removed (not just a small piece), it's called an excisional biopsy .  These biopsies are often done with the patient under general anesthesia (drugs are used to put you into a deep asleep). They can also be done using a nerve block, which numbs a large area. If this type of biopsy is needed, it's important that the surgeon who will later remove the cancer also be the one to do the biopsy.

[1] Additionally, the vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation . Ultraviolet's position on the electromagnetic spectrum is on the boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones , electric power transmission , and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization 's International Agency for Research on Cancer , but the link remains unproven. [2]  Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to increase the future incidence of cancer, particularly leukemia . The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial. The most widely accepted model posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with effective radiation dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert . [3] If the linear model is correct, then natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second.     Contents    1  Causes   1.1  Background  1.2  Medical  1.3  Occupational  1.4  Accidental    2  Mechanism  3  Skin cancer  4  Epidemiology   4.1  Data sources  4.2  Modelling    5  Public safety  6  History  7  Notes  8  References     Causes [ edit ]  According to the prevalent model, any radiation exposure can increase the risk of cancer. Typical contributors to such risk include natural background radiation, medical procedures, occupational exposures, nuclear accidents, and many others. Some major contributors are discussed below.  Background [ edit ]  Radon is responsible for the worldwide majority of the mean public exposure to ionizing radiation . It is often the single largest contributor to an individual's background radiation dose, and is the most variable from location to location. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as attics, and basements. It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs. [4]  Epidemiological evidence shows a clear link between lung cancer and high concentrations of radon, with 21,000 radon-induced U.S. lung cancer deaths per year—second only to cigarette smoking—according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency . [5] Thus in geographic areas where radon is present in heightened concentrations, radon is considered a significant indoor air contaminant.  Residential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as passive smoking . [6] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco. [6]  Medical [ edit ]  In industrialized countries, Medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. Collective dose to Americans from medical imaging grew by a factor of six from 1990 to 2006, mostly due to growing use of 3D scans that impart much more dose per procedure than traditional radiographs . [7] CT scans alone, which account for half the medical imaging dose to the public, are estimated to be responsible for 0.4% of current cancers in the United States, and this may increase to as high as 1.5-2% with 2007 rates of CT usage; [8] however, this estimate is disputed. [9] Other nuclear medicine techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream, and radiotherapy treatments deliberately deliver lethal doses (on a cellular level) to tumors and surrounding tissues.  It has been estimated that CT scans performed in the US in 2007 alone will result in 29,000 new cancer cases in future years. [10] [11] This estimate is criticized by the American College of Radiology (ACR), which maintains that the life expectancy of CT scanned patients is not that of the general population and that the model of calculating cancer is based on total-body radiation exposure and thus faulty. [11]  Occupational [ edit ]  In accordance with ICRP recommendations, most regulators permit nuclear energy workers to receive up to 20 times more radiation dose than is permitted for the general public. [3] Higher doses are usually permitted when responding to an emergency. The majority of workers are routinely kept well within regulatory limits, while a few essential technicians will routinely approach their maximum each year. Accidental overexposures beyond regulatory limits happen globally several times a year. [12] Astronauts on long missions are at higher risk of cancer, see cancer and spaceflight .  Some occupations are exposed to radiation without being classed as nuclear energy workers. Airline crews receive occupational exposures from cosmic radiation because of reduced atmospheric shielding at altitude. Mine workers receive occupational exposures to radon, especially in uranium mines. Anyone working in a granite building, such as the US Capitol , is likely to receive a dose from natural uranium in the granite. [13]  Accidental [ edit ]     Chernobyl radiation map from 1996    Nuclear accidents can have dramatic consequences to their surroundings, but their global impact on cancer is less than that of natural and medical exposures.  The most severe nuclear accident is probably the Chernobyl disaster . In addition to conventional fatalities and acute radiation syndrome fatalities, nine children died of thyroid cancer , and it is estimated that there may be up to 4,000 excess cancer deaths among the approximately 600,000 most highly exposed people. [14] [15] Of the 100 million curies (4 exabecquerels ) of radioactive material, the short lived radioactive isotopes such as 131 I Chernobyl released were initially the most dangerous. Due to their short half-lives of 5 and 8 days they have now decayed, leaving the more long-lived 137 Cs (with a half-life of 30.07 years) and 90 Sr (with a half-life of 28.78 years) as main dangers.  In March 2011, an earthquake and tsunami caused damage that led to explosions and partial meltdowns at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. Significant release of radioactive material took place following hydrogen explosions at three reactors, as technicians tried to pump in seawater to keep the uranium fuel rods cool, and bled radioactive gas from the reactors in order to make room for the seawater. [16] Concerns about the large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in 20 km exclusion zone being set up around the power plant and people within the 20–30 km zone being advised to stay indoors. On March 24, 2011, Japanese officials announced that "radioactive iodine-131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 water-purification plants in Tokyo and five other prefectures". [17]  Other serious radiation accidents include the Kyshtym disaster (estimated 49 to 55 cancer deaths), [18] and the Windscale fire (an estimated 33 cancer deaths). [19] [20]  The Transit 5BN-3 SNAP 9A accident . On April 21, 1964, the satellite containing plutonium burnt up in the atmosphere. Dr. John Gofman claimed it increased the rate of lung cancer worldwide. He said "Although it is impossible to estimate [ dubious  – discuss ] the number of lung cancers induced by the accident, there is no question that the dispersal of so much Plutonium238 would add to the number of lung cancer diagnosed over many subsequent decades." [21] [22]  Mechanism [ edit ]  Cancer is a stochastic effect of radiation, meaning that the probability of occurrence increases with effective radiation dose , but the severity of the cancer is independent of dose. The speed at which cancer advances, the prognosis , the degree of pain, and every other feature of the disease are not functions of the radiation dose to which the person is exposed. This contrasts with the deterministic effects of acute radiation syndrome which increase in severity with dose above a threshold. Cancer starts with a single cell whose operation is disrupted. Normal cell operation is controlled by the chemical structure of DNA molecules, also called chromosomes .  When radiation deposits enough energy in organic tissue to cause ionization , this tends to break molecular bonds, and thus alter the molecular structure of the irradiated molecules. Less energetic radiation, such as visible light, only causes excitation , not ionization, which is usually dissipated as heat with relatively little chemical damage. Ultraviolet light is usually categorized as non-ionizing, but it is actually in an intermediate range that produces some ionization and chemical damage. Hence the carcinogenic mechanism of ultraviolet radiation is similar to that of ionizing radiation.  Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, penetrating radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. [note 1] Molecules broken by radiation can become highly reactive free radicals that cause further chemical damage. Some of this direct and indirect damage will eventually impact chromosomes and epigenetic factors that control the expression of genes. Cellular mechanisms will repair some of this damage, but some repairs will be incorrect and some chromosome abnormalities will turn out to be irreversible.  DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generally accepted to be the most biologically significant lesion by which ionizing radiation causes cancer. [6] In vitro experiments show that ionizing radiation cause DSBs at a rate of 35 DSBs per cell per Gray , [23] and removes a portion of the epigenetic markers of the DNA, [24] which regulate the gene expression. Most of the induced DSBs are repaired within 24h after exposure, however, 25% of the repaired strands are repaired incorrectly and about 20% of fibroblast cells that were exposed to 200mGy died within 4 days after exposure. [25] [26] [27] A portion of the population possess a flawed DNA repair mechanism, and thus suffer a greater insult due to exposure to radiation. [23]  Major damage normally results in the cell dying or being unable to reproduce. This effect is responsible for acute radiation syndrome, but these heavily damaged cells cannot become cancerous. Lighter damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and eventually developing into cancer, especially if tumor suppressor genes are damaged. [6] [28] [29] [30] The latest research suggests that mutagenic events do not occur immediately after irradiation. Instead, surviving cells appear to have acquired a genomic instability which causes an increased rate of mutations in future generations. The cell will then progress through multiple stages of neoplastic transformation that may culminate into a tumor after years of incubation. The neoplastic transformation can be divided into three major independent stages: morphological changes to the cell, acquisition of cellular immortality (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor. [6]  In some cases, a small radiation dose reduces the impact of a subsequent, larger radiation dose. This has been termed an 'adaptive response' and is related to hypothetical mechanisms of hormesis . [31]  A latent period of decades may elapse between radiation exposure and the detection of cancer. Those cancers that may develop as a result of radiation exposure are indistinguishable from those that occur naturally or as a result of exposure to other carcinogens . Furthermore, National Cancer Institute literature indicates that chemical and physical hazards and lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet, significantly contribute to many of these same diseases. Evidence from uranium miners suggests that smoking may have a multiplicative, rather than additive, interaction with radiation. [6] Evaluations of radiation's contribution to cancer incidence can only be done through large epidemiological studies with thorough data about all other confounding risk factors.  Skin cancer [ edit ]  Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies. [32] Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB , as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers , which are the most common forms of cancer in the world. [32]  Skin cancer may occur following ionizing radiation exposure following a latent period averaging 20 to 40 years. [33] [34] A Chronic radiation keratosis is a precancerous keratotic skin lesion that may arise on the skin many years after exposure to ionizing radiation . [35] : 729 Various malignancies may develop, most frequency basal-cell carcinoma followed by squamous-cell carcinoma . [33] [36] [37] Elevated risk is confined to the site of radiation exposure. [38] Several studies have also suggested the possibility of a causal relationship between melanoma and ionizing radiation exposure. [39] The degree of carcinogenic risk arising from low levels of exposure is more contentious, but the available evidence points to an increased risk that is approximately proportional to the dose received. [40]  Radiologists and radiographers are among the earliest occupational groups exposed to radiation. It was the observation of the earliest radiologists that led to the recognition of radiation-induced skin cancer—the first solid cancer linked to radiation—in 1902. [41] While the incidence of skin cancer secondary to medical ionizing radiation was higher in the past, there is also some evidence that risks of certain cancers, notably skin cancer, may be increased among more recent medical radiation workers, and this may be related to specific or changing radiologic practices. [41] Available evidence indicates that the excess risk of skin cancer lasts for 45 years or more following irradiation. [42]  Epidemiology [ edit ]  Cancer is a stochastic effect of radiation, meaning that it only has a probability of occurrence, as opposed to deterministic effects which always happen over a certain dose threshold. The consensus of the nuclear industry, nuclear regulators, and governments, is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with effective radiation dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert . [3] Individual studies, alternate models, and earlier versions of the industry consensus have produced other risk estimates scattered around this consensus model. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this. [43] [44] This model is widely accepted for external radiation, but its application to internal contamination is disputed. For example, the model fails to account for the low rates of cancer in early workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory who were exposed to plutonium dust, and the high rates of thyroid cancer in children following the Chernobyl accident , both of which were internal exposure events. The European Committee on Radiation Risk calls the ICRP model "fatally flawed" when it comes to internal exposure. [45]  Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced leukemias typically require 2–10 years to appear. [6] [46] Some people, such as those with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or retinoblastoma , are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure. [6] Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect. [6]  Radiation exposure can cause cancer in any living tissue, but high-dose whole-body external exposure is most closely associated with leukemia , [47] reflecting the high radiosensitivity of bone marrow. Internal exposures tend to cause cancer in the organs where the radioactive material concentrates, so that radon predominantly causes lung cancer , iodine-131 is most likely to cause thyroid cancer , etc.  Data sources [ edit ]     Increased Risk of Solid Cancer with Dose for A-bomb survivors    The associations between ionizing radiation exposure and the development of cancer are based primarily on the " LSS cohort " of Japanese atomic bomb survivors , the largest human population ever exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation. However this cohort was also exposed to high heat, both from the initial nuclear flash of infrared light and following the blast due their exposure to the firestorm and general fires that developed in both cities respectively, so the survivors also underwent Hyperthermia therapy to various degrees. Hyperthermia, or heat exposure following irradiation is well known in the field of radiation therapy to markedly increase the severity of free-radical insults to cells following irradiation. Presently however no attempts have been made to cater for this confounding factor, it is not included or corrected for in the dose-response curves for this group.  Additional data has been collected from recipients of selected medical procedures and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster . There is a clear link (see the UNSCEAR 2000 Report, Volume 2: Effects ) between the Chernobyl accident and the unusually large number, approximately 1,800, of thyroid cancers reported in contaminated areas, mostly in children.  For low levels of radiation, the biological effects are so small they may not be detected in epidemiological studies. Although radiation may cause cancer at high doses and high dose rates, public health data regarding lower levels of exposure, below about 10 mSv (1,000 mrem), are harder to interpret. To assess the health impacts of lower radiation doses , researchers rely on models of the process by which radiation causes cancer; several models that predict differing levels of risk have emerged.  Studies of occupational workers exposed to chronic low levels of radiation, above normal background, have provided mixed evidence regarding cancer and transgenerational effects. Cancer results, although uncertain, are consistent with estimates of risk based on atomic bomb survivors and suggest that these workers do face a small increase in the probability of developing leukemia and other cancers. One of the most recent and extensive studies of workers was published by Cardis, et al. in 2005 . [48] There is evidence that low level, brief radiation exposures are not harmful. [49]  Modelling [ edit ]     Alternative assumptions for the extrapolation of the cancer risk vs. radiation dose to low-dose levels, given a known risk at a high dose: supra-linearity (A), linear (B), linear-quadratic (C) and hormesis (D).    The linear dose-response model suggests that any increase in dose, no matter how small, results in an incremental increase in risk. The linear no-threshold model (LNT) hypothesis is accepted by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and regulators around the world. [50] According to this model, about 1% of the global population develop cancer as a result of natural background radiation at some point in their lifetime. For comparison, 13% of deaths in 2008 are attributed to cancer, so background radiation could plausibly be a small contributor. [51]  Many parties have criticized the ICRP's adoption of the linear no-threshold model for exaggerating the effects of low radiation doses. The most frequently cited alternatives are the “linear quadratic” model and the “hormesis” model. The linear quadratic model is widely viewed in radiotherapy as the best model of cellular survival, [52] and it is the best fit to leukemia data from the LSS cohort. [6]    Linear no-threshold  F(D)=α⋅D    Linear quadratic  F(D)=α⋅D+β⋅D 2    Hormesis  F(D)=α⋅[D−β]    In all three cases, the values of alpha and beta must be determined by regression from human exposure data. Laboratory experiments on animals and tissue samples is of limited value. Most of the high quality human data available is from high dose individuals, above 0.1 Sv, so any use of the models at low doses is an extrapolation that might be under-conservative or over-conservative. There is not enough human data available to settle decisively which of these model might be most accurate at low doses. The consensus has been to assume linear no-threshold because it the simplest and most conservative of the three.  Radiation hormesis is the conjecture that a low level of ionizing radiation (i.e., near the level of Earth's natural background radiation) helps "immunize" cells against DNA damage from other causes (such as free radicals or larger doses of ionizing radiation), and decreases the risk of cancer. The theory proposes that such low levels activate the body's DNA repair mechanisms, causing higher levels of cellular DNA-repair proteins to be present in the body, improving the body's ability to repair DNA damage. This assertion is very difficult to prove in humans (using, for example, statistical cancer studies) because the effects of very low ionizing radiation levels are too small to be statistically measured amid the "noise" of normal cancer rates.  The idea of radiation hormesis is considered unproven by regulatory bodies. If the hormesis model turns out to be accurate, it is conceivable that current regulations based on the LNT model will prevent or limit the hormetic effect, and thus have a negative impact on health. [53]  Other non-linear effects have been observed, particularly for internal doses . For example, iodine-131 is notable in that high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous than low doses, since they tend to kill thyroid tissues that would otherwise become cancerous as a result of the radiation. Most studies of very-high-dose I-131 for treatment of Graves disease have failed to find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is linear increase in thyroid cancer risk with I-131 absorption at moderate doses. [54]  Public safety [ edit ]  Low-dose exposures, such as living near a nuclear power plant or a coal-fired power plant , which has higher emissions than nuclear plants, are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development, barring accidents. [6] Greater concerns include radon in buildings and overuse of medical imaging.  The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends limiting artificial irradiation of the public to an average of 1 mSv (0.001 Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures. [3] For comparison, radiation levels inside the US capitol building are 0.85 mSv/yr, close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the granite structure. [13] According to the ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk. (20 yr X 0.85 mSv/yr X 0.001 Sv/mSv X 5.5%/Sv = ~0.1%) That "existing risk" is much higher; an average American would have a one in ten chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation.  Internal contamination due to ingestion, inhalation, injection, or absorption is a particular concern because the radioactive material may stay in the body for an extended period of time, "committing" the subject to accumulating dose long after the initial exposure has ceased, albeit at low dose rates. Over a hundred people, including Eben Byers and the radium girls , have received committed doses in excess of 10 Gy and went on to die of cancer or natural causes, whereas the same amount of acute external dose would invariably cause an earlier death by acute radiation syndrome . [55]  Internal exposure of the public is controlled by regulatory limits on the radioactive content of food and water. These limits are typically expressed in becquerel /kilogram, with different limits set for each contaminant.  History [ edit ]  Although radiation was discovered in late 19th century, the dangers of radioactivity and of radiation were not immediately recognized. Acute effects of radiation were first observed in the use of X-rays when Wilhelm Röntgen intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he attributed them to ozone rather than to X-rays. His injuries healed later.  The genetic effects of radiation, including the effects on cancer risk, were recognized much later. In 1927 Hermann Joseph Muller published research showing genetic effects, [56] and in 1946 was awarded the Nobel prize for his findings. Radiation was soon linked to bone cancer in the radium dial painters , but this was not confirmed until large-scale animal studies after World War II. The risk was then quantified through long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors .  Before the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicians and corporations had begun marketing radioactive substances as patent medicine and radioactive quackery . Examples were radium enema treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. Marie Curie spoke out against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later died of acute radiation syndrome , not cancer. Eben Byers , a famous American socialite, died of multiple cancers in 1932 after consuming large quantities of radium over several years; his death drew public attention to dangers of radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death in enthusiasts, radium-containing medical products had nearly vanished from the market.  In the United States, the experience of the so-called Radium Girls , where thousands of radium-dial painters contracted oral cancers, popularized the warnings of occupational health associated with radiation hazards. Robley D. Evans , at MIT, developed the first standard for permissible body burden of radium, a key step in the establishment of nuclear medicine as a field of study. With the development of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons in the 1940s, heightened scientific attention was given to the study of all manner of radiation effects.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In the case of internal contamination with alpha emitters , the distribution may not be so random. Transuranic elements are believed to have a chemical affinity for DNA, and any radioactive element could be part of a chemical compound that targets certain molecules.

Sun and Other Types of Radiation  X-rays, Gamma Rays, and Cancer Risk             Do x-rays and gamma rays cause cancer?    Yes. X-rays and gamma rays are known human carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). The evidence for this comes from many different sources, including studies of atomic bomb survivors in Japan, people exposed during the Chernobyl nuclear accident, people treated with high doses of radiation for cancer and other conditions, and people exposed to high levels of radiation at work, such as uranium miners.  Most studies on radiation and cancer risk have looked at people exposed to high doses of radiation in the settings above. It is harder to measure the much smaller increase in cancer risk that might come from much lower levels of radiation exposure. Most studies have not been able to detect an increased risk of cancer among people exposed to low levels of radiation. For example, people living at high altitudes, who are exposed to more natural background radiation from cosmic rays than people living at sea level, do not have noticeably higher cancer rates.  Still, most scientists and regulatory agencies agree that even small doses of gamma and x-radiation increase cancer risk, although by a very small amount. In general, the risk of cancer from radiation exposure increases as the dose of radiation increases. Likewise, the lower the exposure is, the smaller the increase in risk. But there is no threshold below which this kind of radiation is thought to be totally safe.  What do the studies show?  Atomic bomb survivors  Much of what we know about cancer risks from radiation is based on studies of the survivors of the atomic bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. These people had higher risks of some, but not all cancers. Studies have found an increased risk of the following cancers (from higher to lower risk):   Most types of leukemia (although not chronic lymphocytic leukemia)  Multiple myeloma  Thyroid cancer  Bladder cancer  Breast cancer  Lung cancer  Ovarian cancer  Colon cancer (but not rectal cancer)  Esophageal cancer  Stomach cancer  Liver cancer  Lymphoma  Skin cancer (besides melanoma)   For most of these cancers, the risk was highest for those exposed as children, and was lower as the age at exposure increased. Those exposed while still in the womb (in utero) had lower risks than those exposed during childhood.  Higher radiation exposure was linked to higher risk of cancer, but even low amounts of radiation were linked to an increased risk of getting and dying from cancer. There was no clear cut-off for safe radiation exposure.  These cancers took years to develop, but some cancers appeared sooner than others. Deaths from leukemia went up about 2 to 3 years after exposure, with the number of cases peaking after about 10 years and going down after that. Solid tumors took longer to develop. For example, excess deaths from lung cancer began to be seen about 20 years after exposure.  Chernobyl accident  Children and adolescents living near the Chernobyl plant at the time of the accident had an increased risk of thyroid cancer linked to exposure to radioactive iodine. The risk was higher in areas that were iodine deficient. This increased risk was not seen in adults living in the area.  Workers employed in cleanup operations from 1986-1990 had an increased risk of leukemia (all types). These individuals had higher and more prolonged radiation exposures that the population residing around the plant.  Nuclear weapons testing  Studies suggest that some people who were children during the period of above ground nuclear testing in the US may develop thyroid cancer as a result of exposure to radioactive iodine in milk.  Radiation therapy  To treat benign conditions  Although radiation therapy is now mostly used to treat cancer, it was used to treat a number of benign (non-cancerous) diseases before the risks were clearer. Studies of these patients have helped us learn about how radiation affects cancer risk.  Peptic ulcer disease: A large study of people who were treated with high doses of radiation (an average of 15 Gy or 15,000 mSv) for the treatment of peptic ulcers found a higher risk of cancer of the stomach and pancreas.  Ringworm of the scalp: Studies of people who were treated with radiation to treat a fungal infection of the scalp (called scalp  ringworm or tinea capitis ) have found an increased risk of basal cell skin cancers. The risk was lower in people who were older when treated. This increased risk was seen only in white patients, and the cancers occurred more often in sun-exposed skin of the head and neck (as opposed to the scalp), which implies that ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a role in these cancers as well.  Ankylosing spondylitis: Studies have looked at the cancer risks of patients with the autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis who were injected with a form of radium.  In one study, patients who received a high dose (average bone dose of 31,000 mGy) had an increased risk of bone sarcoma. The risks of some other cancers, such as breast, liver, kidney, bladder, and other sarcomas, may also have been increased. About one-quarter of the patients in this study were younger than 20 years of age when they were treated with radiation.  In another study, patients treated with a lower dose of radium (average bone dose of 6,000 mGy) had a higher risk of leukemia, but not of any other cancers. Most of the patients in this study were adults at the time of treatment.  Other studies: Treatment of the head and neck area with radiation for benign conditions has also been linked to cancers of the salivary gland and brain and spinal cord in adults in some studies. Children treated with radiation to this area also have an increased risk of thyroid cancer.  To treat cancer  Studies have linked radiation therapy to treat cancer with an increased risk of leukemia, thyroid cancer, early-onset breast cancer, and some other cancers. The risk of cancer depends on a number of factors, include the dose of radiation, the part of the body being treated, the age of the person getting it (younger people are generally at greater risk), and the use of other treatments such as chemotherapy.  For example, people who get pelvic radiation therapy would not be expected to have higher rates of cancers in the head and neck because these areas weren’t exposed to the radiation from the treatment. Other factors might also play a role in how likely a person exposed to radiation is to develop cancer. For example, some genetic conditions can mean that a person’s cells are more vulnerable to radiation damage, which might in turn raise their risk more than in someone without these gene changes.  If cancer does develop after radiation therapy, it does not happen right away. For leukemias, most cases develop within 5 to 9 years after exposure. In contrast, other cancers often take much longer to develop. Most of these cancers are not seen for at least 10 years after radiation therapy, and some are diagnosed even more than 15 years later.  When considering radiation exposure from radiation therapy treatment for cancer, the benefits generally outweigh the risks. Overall, radiation therapy alone does not appear to be a very strong cause of second cancers. This is probably due to the fact that doctors try to focus the radiation on the cancer cells as much as possible, which means few normal cells are exposed to radiation. However, some combinations of radiation therapy and chemotherapy are more risky than others. Doctors do their best to ensure the treatment that is given destroys the cancer while limiting the risk that a secondary cancer will develop later on.  For more information, see Second Cancers in Adults .  Imaging tests  Some studies have estimated the risk of radiation exposure from imaging tests based on the risks from similar amounts of radiation exposure in the studies of the atomic bomb survivors. Based on these studies, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that exposure to 10 mSv from an imaging test would be expected to increase the risk of death from cancer by about 1 chance in 2000.  It can be difficult to study cancer risks from imaging studies that use radiation. In order to see small risks (such as 1 in 2000), a study would have to look at 10s or 100s of thousands of people. Information about other exposures that could be cancer risk factors would be needed, to see if it was likely that the cancer came from the radiation exposure. Since cancers from radiation take years to develop, the study would need to follow the patients for many years.  Often, scientists use questionnaire studies to look for possible causes of cancer. These studies compare exposures among people who have a certain cancer to those who don’t. They may instead compare people who had a certain exposure (like to radiation) to those who didn’t. However, this is difficult to do for diagnostic radiation exposure since many people cannot accurately recall information about things that happened many years before (such as in childhood) and information about all the imaging tests that were done is often not available. There is also a concern that people with cancer tend to over report exposures that they worry may have caused their cancers.  Studies that have found increased risk of cancer after imaging tests that use x-rays often involve people who had multiple tests or high dose procedures, including:  Fluoroscopy  Studies of women who had been imaged many times with fluoroscopy as a teenager or young woman during treatment for tuberculosis have found an increased risk of breast cancer years later.  Spine x-rays  Teenagers and young women who had many x-rays of the spine to monitor scoliosis have been found to have an increased risk of breast cancer later on.  Dental x-rays  A study compared a group of people with meningioma (a brain tumor that is most often benign) with a group without the tumors. It found that the people who had the tumors were more likely to have had a type of dental x-ray called a bite-wing, and to have had bite-wing or Panorex x-rays every year.  CT scans  A study in England of exposure to radiation from CT scans found that children who received a dose of at least 30 mGy (the same as 30 mSv) to the bone marrow had 3 times the risk of leukemia compared to those who received a dose of 5 mGy or less. For brain tumors, a dose of 50 mGy or more to the brain was linked to more than 3 times the risk.  A study in Australia of exposure to radiation from CT scans in childhood and adolescence found that after an average of about 9 ½ years, those who had a CT scan had a 24% higher risk of cancer overall. The risk of cancer was higher the more CT scans the person had, and it was also higher the younger the person was at the time of the CT scan. Still, the overall risk of cancer was still low.  A study from Taiwan found that children and teens who had a CT scan of the head did not have a higher risk of brain cancer or leukemia, but were more likely to be diagnosed with a benign brain tumor.  What do expert agencies say?  Several agencies (national and international) study different substances in the environment to determine if they can cause cancer. (A substance that causes cancer or helps cancer grow is called a carcinogen .) The American Cancer Society looks to these organizations to evaluate the risks based on evidence from laboratory, animal, and human research studies.  Based on animal and human evidence, several expert agencies have evaluated the cancer-causing nature of x-rays and gamma rays.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). Its major goal is to identify causes of cancer. Based on the data available, IARC classifies x- and gamma radiation as a “known human carcinogen.”  The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is formed from parts of several different US government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NTP has classified x- and gamma radiation as “known to be a human carcinogen.”  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits for exposure to x-rays and gamma rays in part because it recognizes that this form of radiation can cause cancer.

First, though, remember that without radiation exposure , the odds of getting cancer are 1 in 2.4 (or 42 percent). This means that of 100 average people I know, including me, 42 of us may get cancer at some time in our lives. In addition, if I go to the doctor and have a pelvic CT scan ( dose <= 1 rem ), my cancer odds stay 1 in 2.4 (or 42 percent). If I have 10 CT scans, my cancer odds are now 1 in 2.3 (or 43.7 percent). If I live next to the perimeter fence around a nuclear power plant for 40 years, my cancer odds are 1 in 2.4, the same as baseline with no extra radiation exposure .  With that information we now have a better understanding of the approximate risks of radiation doses. We can see that radiation doses less than 10 rem are unlikely to cause harmful effects and only slightly increase our chances of getting cancer. Whether to be concerned or not is still a personal decision. Taking steps to keep our exposure to any potentially harmful agent reasonably small is important. It is a personal responsibility for ourselves and our families.  We must, however, try to make informed decisions based on the real and not the perceived risks in our everyday lives. When we do that, we can lower or eliminate the higher risks over which we have control and not agonize over lowering risks that are already low. Often, we believe that if radiation is present there is a high risk . As can be seen from the charts and the information in this section, we know this is not true. To compare the chances of getting cancer from radiation exposure to other more common chances of diseases or accidents, see our Probability Table .  X Rays & Cancer  Let’s look at the risk of cancer, then, from some basic x rays . Here are the radiation sources, the approximate dose of radiation you get from them, and how much your chances of getting cancer increases in your lifetime as a result of that radiation dose . Remember, with no extra radiation dose , your odds of getting cancer in your lifetime are about 10 out of 24 (or 1 in 2.4) or 42 percent.      Radiation Source  Effective Dose  Additional Chances of Getting Cancer‡*     bitewing dental film  annual dose living at nuclear power plant perimeter  skull x ray  chest x ray    Less than (<) or equal to (=) 0.01 rem    <=1 in 60,000      spine x ray  abdominal x ray  pelvis x ray  hip x ray  mammogram    <=0.1 rem    <=1 in 6,000      kidney series of x rays  most barium-related x rays  head CT +   any spine x-ray series  one year’s worth of natural background radiation  most nuclear medicine liver, kidney, bone, brain, or lung scans    <=0.5 rem    <=1 in 1,200      barium enema  chest, abdomen, or pelvic CT +     <=1.0 rem    <=1 in 600      cardiac catheterization  coronary angiogram  other heart x-ray studies  most nuclear medicine heart scans    <=5.0 rem    <=1 in 120        ‡The “odds” numbers in this column are estimated numbers of increased cancers; the real number in each case may be zero up to the number cited. For instance, the odds of 1 in 120 really are “zero up to 1” in 120.  *Numbers from the National Radiation Protection Board (now the United Kingdom Health Protection Authority)   + CT = computerized tomography; a specialized x-ray exam.       So, you can see that even with many types of radiation exposures and medical exams, the ordinary everyday odds of getting a cancer (1 in 2.4) are much higher than the added chances of getting cancer from radiation exposure .     ©2007 RadiationAnswers.org .

Megan Alcalay   Health           Did you know? Medical procedures amount to 96% of man-made radiation that humans are exposed to. Wow. Studies show that radiation exposure from imaging tests, like x-rays or CT scans, is never safe. Yet, these tests provide valuable information about your health, and allow your physician to make accurate diagnoses. X-rays and CT scans are necessary tools in medicine... they are also classified as carcinogens. X-ray medical tests have been around for 120 years, when it was discovered that producing a concentrated beam of electrons through the body onto metal film resulted in an internal image of the body. CT scans were developed in the 1970’s and consist of multiple x-rays and thus significantly higher radiation exposure. The radiation emitted during these procedures is called ionizing radiation – radiation with so much energy, that during interaction with an atom, removes electrons from the atom’s orbit. The atom becomes charged or ionized. When this occurs within the human body, the cell either dies, repairs itself, or mutates incorrectly and can become cancerous. Your Normal Medical Exposure and Associated Risk Numerous studies have validated the positive correlation between radiation exposure and cancer risk. Based on these studies, the FDA estimates that exposure to 10 millisieverts (mSv) from an x-ray or CT scan increases the risk of death from cancer by 1 in 2000 (.05%) , a relatively small amount. According to cancer.org , a “study in England of exposure to radiation from CT scans found that children who received a dose of at least 30 mSv to the bone marrow had 3 times the risk of leukemia compared to those who received a dose of 5 mSv or less. For brain tumors, a dose of 50 mSv or more to the brain was linked to more than 3 times the risk.” The average radiation exposure per x-ray is .28 mSv . You would need approximately 36 x-rays throughout your lifetime to raise your risk of cancer by .05% . The average radiation exposure per CT scan is 6.3 mSv . After approximately two CT scans, your risk of cancer increases by .05% . CT scans are far more risky than x-rays, yet they are a noninvasive way to study all parts of the body and assist doctors in diagnosing and treating vascular diseases, cancer, spinal problems, internal injuries, trauma and more. [Note: MRI’s, another common diagnostic tool, do not use ionizing radiation. ] Some Perspective – Airport Scanners The most common airport scanners – the old-school metal detectors and new-school millimeter scanners (the plastic booth) – do not use ionizing radiation . Backscatter scanners (where you stand between the two boxes) average between 0.00005 to 0.0001 mSv per scan. You would need 1,000 to 2,000 airport (backscatter) scans to get a dose equivalent to a single chest x-ray ! Is there a definitive threshold where x-rays go from safe to dangerous? Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. There is no scientifically validated number of x-rays or CT scans that you are granted in your lifetime without risk of harm. Each test varies in its levels of emitted radiation, and tissues and organs vary in sensitivity to the radiation exposure. But, here’s a very helpful chart that provides details about common imaging tests and their corresponding effective radiation doses. The Bottom Line | TL;DR To optimize your longevity and vitality, we recommend avoiding known carcinogens, including radiation, whenever possible . We encourage you to be informed about your tests, understand how much lifetime medical radiation you’ve been exposed to, and be cautious and inquisitive with young children and radiation exposure. However, remember it takes almost 40 x-rays or two CT scans to increase your risk of cancer by .05%. When requested by a physician as a medical tool, you shouldn’t be scared of medical x-rays or CT scans as a cancer risk . Take Initiative With Medical Radiation Ask questions. Ask your physician why an imaging test will help them determine your treatment. If your doctor explains why it is needed, do not refuse an x-ray or CT scan. In many situations, the risk of not getting a scan (and thus proper treatment) far outweighs the risk of the radiation exposure. Don’t insist on an x-ray or CT scan. Sometimes physicians will order an x-ray because their patient insists on one. Don’t be this patient. Allow your physician to do their job. If you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Radiation exposure is riskier to an unborn baby than to an adult. If pregnant and in need of an imaging test, clearly understand the risks and ask if there are ways to protect the developing fetus. Ask if a gonad shield can be used. Often there are ways to shield the more sensitive tissues and organs. Stay informed to minimize your cancer risk. We are surrounded by carcinogens. There is no scientific evidence enabling us to pinpoint exactly what will keep us healthy and what will make us ill. However, study after study points to actions we can take daily to maintain harmony in our environment, from lifestyle choices, to diet and stress reduction.

Ionising radiation is a type of radiation called ‘high energy’. The high energy that ionising radiation has means it can affect our cells, including mutating DNA which can lead to cancer. This is different to non-ionising radiation , which has less energy.  There are different types of ionising radiation, including gamma rays and x-rays.  It’s important to remember that we are exposed to radiation from natural sources every day. Radon gas from the earth’s crust contributes the largest amount of natural radiation to most people living in the UK. Cosmic rays from the sun, stars and outer space, natural radiation from the food we eat, the water we drink and the ground we walk on, also contribute to our natural exposure every day. Watch our video to find out more.  To help avoid the potential health effects of ionising radiation, any man-made exposures are tightly regulated.  Can X-rays and medical imaging increase the risk of cancer?  Medical x-rays and other types of imaging are very important to help diagnose different illnesses, including cancer. Some types of imaging, including X-rays and CT scans (Computed Tomography) use ionising radiation. The health risks from the radiation the imaging equipment uses are generally very low, and usually outweighed by the benefits of getting the right diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Nevertheless, there is evidence that exposure to diagnostic x-rays slightly increases the risk of getting diagnosed with cancer many years or decades later. About 6 in 1,000 cancers in the UK are caused by diagnostic radiation.  The dose received from medical imaging is usually less than what we'd be exposed to naturally over a few days or years (depending on the type of imaging technique used and the part of the body being scanned). Although medical x-rays add some extra radiation on top of natural radiation exposure, they also bring great benefits to patients. But unnecessary x-rays or medical scans should be avoided.  Common types of medical x-rays  There are different types of medical imaging tests using x-rays that you may come across:  Radiography to look at broken bones or your teeth and chest  Mammography to screen for breast cancers  Computed tomography (CT) to detect different diseases, including some cancers  Fluoroscopy, such as barium x-rays, to look at your digestive system  How much radiation does an x-ray give out?  These tests all involve different amounts of radiation. The level of risk from the radiation you receive will depend on:  The type of scan you have – for example a chest x-ray poses a lower risk than a CT scan of the chest  The area of the body – for example dental x-rays pose a lower risk than chest x-rays  Age – young patients are at more risk. Unborn babies are also at higher risk so you should tell your doctor if you’re pregnant  Gender – women have a slightly higher lifetime risk of developing radiation-induced cancers than men  In the UK, the Public Health England monitors the amount of radiation we receive from x-rays and makes sure they are as safe as possible. You can find out more about radiation from medical x-rays on the Public Health England website .  Are there ways to limit radiation if I need an x-ray?  When possible, your doctors will recommend other types of imaging that don’t use radiation, for example using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan). But in some cases an x-ray is the best way to do the job.  If you are concerned about having a large number of x-rays, you should talk to your doctor about it. You should also tell your doctor of previous x-rays you may have had. They may be useful for diagnosing, managing or treating your current condition. And they may mean that you do not need to have more x-ray tests.  What are the risks of commercially available body scans?  Some commercial companies offer ‘full body’ CT and PET (positron emission tomography) scans to the public. These are available to people who are willing to pay privately, even if the scans aren’t recommended by their doctor and aren’t medically necessary. These scans have risks, and when they are not needed or done on people with no medical symptoms, they are likely to do more harm than good.  A ‘full body’ PET CT scan (in which a PET and a CT scan are done at the same time) uses more than 1000 times the amount of radiation of a single chest x-ray. This may be necessary for people with a genuine medical need. But for healthy people without symptoms, the risks generally outweigh the benefits. And while scans are helpful for finding out what is causing a symptom, in people with no symptoms these scans can flag up harmless abnormalities, or conditions which would never have caused any problems. So they may lead to unnecessary tests and treatment.  Can air travel increase the risk of cancer?  Travelling by plane is a safe way to travel and is unlikely to affect your risk of cancer.  Does air travel expose people to radiation?  The Earth receives a lot of ‘cosmic radiation’ from space, but our atmosphere shields us from most of this. The atmosphere thins the higher you get, so someone flying in a plane would receive more cosmic radiation than someone on the ground.  A passenger would get a very small extra amount of radiation, but the low level of radiation that they would experience is very unlikely to seriously affect their cancer risk, even if they were a frequent flyer.  Do airport body scanners use radiation?  Body scanners are used in many airports across the UK and abroad. There are two types of scanner in the UK. One type uses millimetre radio waves that can “see” through clothing. The other type uses a very low dose of ionising radiation. Neither type has been shown to pose a risk to people’s health.  The first type of scanner uses radio waves, which are a form of non-ionising radiation that does not cause health effects at the low doses given off by airport scanners. Read more about non-ionising radiation, such as that used in mobile phones, wifi and power lines here.  The second type uses ionising radiation, which in high doses can be harmful. But the levels used in airport scanners are about 100,000 times lower than what an average UK person would naturally be exposed to each year. This dose is so low that it makes no noticeable difference to a person’s risk of cancer.  Can living near a nuclear power plant increase the risk of cancer?  So far, the evidence shows that it is unlikely that people who live near nuclear power plants are at a higher risk of cancer.  What does the evidence say?  Most of the evidence to date comes from small studies looking at childhood cancers, particularly childhood leukaemia. Larger studies on this topic are difficult to do, as there aren’t that many children living near nuclear power plants who develop leukaemia or other cancers.  Recently, a group of researchers combined the evidence from several small European studies, showing that overall there is no increased risk for those aged under 15 years living within 25km of a nuclear power plant.  But for children under 5 who live closer (within 5km) to a nuclear power plant the evidence is more mixed. Some studies found a small but increased risk of leukaemia, while others did not. This may have to do with different study designs, differences between the countries in which the studies were done, or other factors that could influence the risk of leukaemia (such as infections).  Based on the evidence available at the moment, the government’s Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) has concluded that “there is no evidence to support the view that there is an increased risk of childhood leukaemia and other cancers in the vicinity of nuclear power plants in Great Britain”.  Nuclear disasters and cancer  Nuclear disasters are events that may expose populations to higher levels of ionising radiation. Examples include the nuclear power plant accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima , as well as the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Studies of survivors of these events have found that the risk of developing thyroid cancer is higher in these populations, particularly in those who were aged less than 18 at the time of the disasters. But because cancers usually take a number of years to develop after radiation exposure, it’s difficult to say with certainty which cancers were caused by the extra radiation. And there is also evidence that – at least in the case of Fukushima – increased screening efforts can lead to the detection of more thyroid cancers, including cancers that weren’t caused by radiation and that would never have caused harm in someone's lifetime – this is called overdiagnosis.  There is no evidence that the risk of other cancer types rises considerably by exposure to ionising radiation from nuclear accidents in people in the general population – mostly because the doses received are too low to have major effects. But there is some evidence from Chernobyl that clean-up workers, who were exposed to very high levels of radiation, have a higher risk of some types of cancer, particularly leukaemia. For survivors of the nuclear bombings, risk of some types of cancer is also increased.  Studies looking at the long-term effects of nuclear disasters, particularly the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011, are still ongoing.

Cancer Do X-Rays Increase My Risk of Cancer? The risks are real—but usually outweighed by the benefits. SHARE TWEET Markham Heid Jan 18 2018, 5:00pm Caspar Benson/Getty Images One irony of modern medicine is that, the more effective a treatment or technology becomes, the more we take it for granted and focus on its downsides—real or imagined.  The most glaring example is vaccines, which have saved millions of lives, but which some people— based on zero credible science —continue to blame for autism and other developmental issues in children. The cancer concerns associated with X-ray radiation aren’t nearly so overblown. But before digging into those concerns, it’s important to recognize how much CT scans and other forms of X-ray imaging have revolutionized health care.  Search for lists of the medical innovations that most improved patient care during the last 50 years, and computer tomography—the X-ray technology used to perform CT scans—will always land at or near the top of the list. “It changed the practice of medicine,” says Sanjay Saini, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School. Whether isolating a tumor and mapping its growth, or revealing diseases of the bowels or internal organs, a CT scan is much more likely to save your life than imperil it.  That said, there are legitimate cancer risks associated with CT imaging. But those risks are “very small,” says David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Medical Center.  According to a 2007 study Brenner published in the New England Journal of Medicine , if you’re under 30 at the time of a CT, your risk for cancer may jump anywhere from .01% to .14%. (If you’re older, your cancer risks from CT are lower.) But Brenner says that, thanks to advances in CT technology, his 2007 risk estimates are probably too high. “I would characterize our best estimates of the risks of cancer associated with a CT today in the range of one chance in 2,000 to one chance in 20,000,” he says.  He adds that the cancer risks associated with CT are “not on the same scale” as the risks associated with smoking or other well-established carcinogens.  Researchers single out CT because this form of imaging exposes you to levels of radiation “orders of magnitude” higher than traditional X-ray, Saini explains. While old-school X-rays are designed to grab a single snapshot of your insides, CT scans work by taking a series of 2D images from many different angles, which are then assembled to form a 3D image. “Five hundred chest X-rays are equal to one CT scan,” Saini says. (When it comes to the dentist office X-rays of your teeth—the ones where they drape you with that discomfiting lead vest—the radiation exposures are in the realm of chest X-rays, he adds.) Saini points out that the whole planet is mildly radioactive, and you’re exposed to more of that radiation when you spend time at high altitudes. “If you take an airplane from Boston to the West Coast, the amount of [radiation] exposure is about what you’d get from a chest X-ray,” he says. There’s no evidence that pilots or flight attendants experience elevated cancer rates due to increased radiation exposure. So as far as basic X-rays are concerned, your cancer risks are minute—if not zero, he says.  Also important to note: Not all medical imaging exposes you to radiation. MRI, for example, uses magnetic resonance—not electromagnetic radiation—to peer inside your body. MRIs are not associated with any cancer risks whatsoever, Brenner explains.  So should you freak out about CT scans? Both Brenner and Siani say radiation exposure and cancer have a linear relationship—meaning the more you’re exposed, the greater your risks. Some researchers dispute this . But a large-scale study from Australia found having a single CT scan before age 20 raises a person’s relative lifetime risk for cancer by 24%. The higher the radiation exposure and the younger the person, the greater the risk.  Yes, that 24 percent figure is frightening. But the actual number of study participants who developed cancer was quite small. Out of the more than 680,000 young people who had a CT scan, the Aussie researchers turned up just 3,150 total cancer cases among them.  Taking into account the recent advancements in CT technology—advancements that allow for lower doses of radiation—the odds that you’ll develop cancer from a CT scan are extremely low, especially if you’re an adult, Brenner says. Still, he worries about the overuse of CT. “I think there are many situations where people are prescribed CT when not needing it,” he says. “The percentage [of needless CT scans] may be as high as 20 or 25 percent, and given that there are 80 million CT scans performed every year, that’s a big number.”  He says young people who undergo multiple CT scans are most at risk. “People who get kidney stones tend to get them again and again,” he says. The first time a patient has a kidney stone, a CT is needed to rule out other health issues. “But the third and fourth and fifth time these patients have a kidney stone, they don’t need a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis,” he says.  Saini says young people and pregnant women also need to be cautious. “We know that cells replicating are more likely to be injured [by radiation exposure] than those that are not,” he says. This cell injury can lead to the formation of tumors or cancer cells. And because cell reproduction is more common in fetuses and young people, CT scans should not be performed on these patient populations if it can be helped, he says.  So what are you supposed to do if your doctor recommends a CT scan? “There’s no reason you shouldn’t ask your physician if CT is medically justified,” Brenner says. He mentions the appropriateness criteria established by the American College of Radiologists, which are basically a set of evidence-based rules for when to perform a CT, and when it’s not necessary. If your doctor’s justification doesn’t convince you, it may be worth seeking a second opinion before undergoing the CT (assuming it’s not an emergency situation).  “The bottom line is, when you need a CT scan, you absolutely should have one because the benefits are huge and the risks are small,” Brenner says. “But if you don’t need a CT scan, the benefits are zero, and so even small risks outweigh the benefits.” Read This Next: Exactly What Happens When Your Body Is Exposed to Radiation SHARE TWEET Tagged: DOCTORS radiation x-ray body guide to healthcare Welcome to Club Tonic.

Radiation from the Environment  Background radiation  Background radiation refers to radiation that naturally occurs in our environment and does not come from any manufactured devices.  Radiation is emitted from the earth, sun, our galaxy, and other galaxies.  Even the human body naturally contains some radioactive elements. 8  People who receive few or no high-dose radiation medical tests usually get more exposure to radiation from the natural environment than from any manufactured device. 9  This is because we are constantly exposed to a very low dose radiation for our whole lives, while devices such as x-ray tests expose you to radiation for a very short period of time.  On the other hand, one CT scan can be equal to several years of background radiation exposures, so many people receive much higher doses of radiation from medical devices than they do from the natural environment.  The risk of developing cancer from a lifetime exposure of background radiation is about 1 in 100, or 1% of the population. 10 It is impossible to avoid all background radiation, but the best ways to limit unnecessary exposure to radiation from the environment is to prevent your exposure to radon and repeated unprotected sun exposure.  Radon  Radon is a color less, odorless gas that comes from decaying rocks and soil.  For the average person, radon accounts for over half their annual exposure to radiation.  Radon comes up from the ground and gets trapped in houses and buildings.  Exposure to a small amount of radon inside is normal, but high levels can cause lung cancer.  Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer (smoking is the leading cause), and approximately 1 in every 15 houses have too much radon.  The only way to know if you have a safe level of radon in your house is to get it tested. 11  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation is radiation that comes from the galaxy and from the earth.  It makes up about 8% of our average yearly exposure to radiation. 12 Cosmic radiation includes ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun that cause tans and sunburns.  UV rays can also damage the DNA in our skin cells and lead to skin cancer. 13 Although we cannot avoid UV rays all the time, limiting exposure to direct sun light can reduce your risk of skin cancer.  Tanning beds are also a common source of UV radiation and are just as dangerous as radiation from the sun.  For more information on tanning beds, please read: Tanning Beds: Safe Alternative to Sun?  Being at higher altitudes, such as flying on a plane or living in a “mile high” location, will exposure you to higher levels of cosmic radiation than being at sea level.  While there is technically no “safe” dose of ionizing radiation, the chances of getting cancer from frequent plane trips is very slim.  Studies of airline crew members have not found a significant increase in risk of cancer after many years of working on airplane. 14  In addition, living in Denver or other high altitude locations that receive higher doses of cosmic radiation has not been shown to increase the risk of cancer. 15   How to Reduce Radiation Exposure from the Environment  Radon :  Test the level of radon inside your house to make sure it is not too high.  You can hire a professional to do this or you can purchase a “do-it-yourself” radon testing kit.  It generally takes only a few minutes and is easy to do.  If there is too high a level of radon in your house, people usually install an active soil depressurization (ASD) system, which is basically a ventilation system. 2  UV Radiation: Some of the best ways to reduce your exposure to harmful UV rays are to:   Wear sunscreen (at least SPF 15) year-round in all areas of your body that are exposed to the sun. (However, it is good to get vitamin D from the sun for 15 minutes each day.)  Stay in the shade, especially when the sun is at it’s strongest (between 10am and 4pm)  Wear protective clothing, such as broad-brimmed hats and tightly-woven clothes that cover your hands and legs.    Medical Devices that Use Radiation  X-rays  X-rays use ionizing radiation and are used for many types of diagnostic tests such as CT scans, mammograms, fluoroscopy, and simple x-rays.  These tests allow your doctor to see potential problems inside your body and choose an appropriate treatment.  They can help doctors make life-saving decisions, but some doctors are performing unnecessary scans or are using doses of radiation that are too high. 16 Since x-rays use ionizing radiation, they can cause damage to our cells and DNA. X-ray tests can lead to cancer, but several common tests (such as mammograms and bone x-rays) use very low doses that have not been shown to cause a significant increased risk of cancer when administered properly.  Over the past few decades, the average level of radiation that Americans are exposed to has increased rapidly due to increased use of medical diagnostic tests such as x-rays (including dental x-rays and mammograms) and CT scans and cancer treatments.  Diagnostic tests and treatments can help improve patients’ quality and length of life, but there are also risks.  Usually, the benefit of receiving one of these tests outweighs the risk, but patients and doctors need to be wary of performing unnecessary tests, particularly if the test uses high doses of radiation.  Not all imaging tests use radiation that has been linked to cancer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) and ultrasounds do not use x-rays.  Instead, they use non-ionizing radiation and have not been found to increase the risk of cancer or other health problems. 17  MRIs and Ultrasounds are a safer alternative to diagnostics tests that use x-rays or other ionizing radiation.  Children, young adults, and fetuses of pregnant women should be particularly careful about getting any x-ray tests.  Children, young adults, and fetuses are more sensitive to radiation, and their young age also allows a longer period of time for cancer to develop. 18 , 19 , 20  Pregnant women should avoid any x-ray exposure, particularly when they are less than 20 weeks pregnant, since radiation exposure in the womb can lead to mental retardation, growth retardation, leukemia, and other cancers later in life. 21 If it is necessary for a pregnant women to be x-rayed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states a single x-ray test does not harm the fetus, but a protective lead apron should be used to cover the abdomen. 22 However, high-dose, multiple-dose, or x-rays of the pelvic region should be avoided for pregnant women, whenever possible.  Many people get simple x-ray tests, such as an arm, leg, chest, or dental x-ray that look for broken bones or other problems.  Simple x-ray tests use very low doses of radiation, 23   and studies have not found an increase risk of cancer among humans who have received a very low dose of radiation. 24 Although the dose of radiation used to x-ray different parts of the body will vary, most simple x-rays use less radiation than other types of x-ray scans (such as a mammogram or CT scan).  Mammograms  Mammograms are an x-ray test that is used to detect breast cancer.  This test uses a higher dose of radiation than a simple x-ray, but less than a CT scan or Fluoroscopy.  According to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, a woman above age 50 who is at average risk of breast cancer should get a mammogram test once every two years  until age 74 . 25 These new guidelines would expose women to less than half the amount of radiation from mammograms than following previous recommendations (which included annual mammograms starting at age 40 for women at average risk).  While these doses of radiation could cause new cases of breast cancer, the appropriate use of mammograms has resulted in lives saved, and the benefits of getting regular mammograms are likely to be even greater than the risks when the frequency of mammograms is reduced to every other year.  Women who are carriers of the BRCA genetic mutation were previously recommended to begin yearly mammograms at age 25-30, since this mutation puts them at much higher risk of getting breast cancer.  Newer studies have found that starting yearly mammograms before age 35 has no benefit to these women and may instead be harmful.  They end up with higher exposure to radiation over their lifetime, which increases the chance of getting radiation-induced breast cancer that they may not have gotten otherwise. 26  Fluoroscopy  Fluoroscopyis an x-ray test that allows doctors to see a continuous x-ray image of your body (like a movie, rather than just a picture as with other x-ray tests).  Fluoroscopy uses an x-ray absorbing dye that is either drunk or injected into the body, which allows doctors to see a better outline of the organ.  This procedure is used to view the digestive system (such as stomach, kidneys, or colon), arteries, or joints. 27  Since this test sends x-ray beams over an extended period of time (usually 20-60 minutes), 28 it exposes people to much higher doses of radiation than a simple x-ray test, although the doses vary widely depending on the test.  Fluoroscopy and CT scans both use high doses of radiation and pose the greatest and most avoidable risk of radiation-induced cancer.  Limiting the number of CT and fluoroscopy tests you receive is one of the best ways you can avoid getting cancer from radiation.  In addition to increasing cancer risk, this test can damage the skin and cause burns. 29  Computed Tomographic (CT) scans  CT Scans are a relatively new type of diagnostic imaging technology that allows doctors to view 3-dimentional pictures of various organs in your body.  CT scans use higher doses of radiation than most other types of diagnostic test and are likely to cause new cancers in some patients, compared to their risk if they had not received a CT scan.  Today, an American’s average lifetime dose of radiation from diagnostic procedures is six times higher than it was in the 1980s. 30 This is largely due to the increased use of CT scans. Everyday, 19,500 CT scans are performed in the U.S. and this number continues to climb. Each CT scan is equivalent to 30 – 442 chest x-rays, depending on the dose used for the CT scan. 31 One study projected that CT scans performed in the U.S. in 2007 alone will result in 29,000 new cancer cases and roughly 15,000 deaths that would not have occurred if they had not received a CT scan. 32 These risks would increase with each additional CT scan a person receives.  Low-dose CT scans, which expose patients to less radiation, are now being used to screen for lung cancer, with concerns about whether the benefits outweigh the risks.  For more information on low-dose CTs, click here .  Unfortunately, there is no established guideline for how much radiation should be used for each procedure.  Different scans require different levels of radiation in order to get a clear image, but some doctors are using more radiation than is necessary.  One study found that different medical facilities had huge variations in the dose of radiation used for the same procedure.  On average, the highest dose given for a CT scan was 13 times higher than the lowest does given for the same type of scan. 33 The researchers found no pattern in why this dose variation occurred, and no scientific justification.  Children’s exposure to radiation from CT scans is particularly worrisome because children have many more years to develop cancer than adults receiving CT scans and are more sensitive to the effects of radiation.  A June 2012 study found that children receiving higher doses of radiation — through multiple CT scans– were more likely to develop brain tumors and leukemia than children who had only one CT scan. 34 However, brain tumors and leukemia are very rare conditions and the increased risk due to CT scans was relatively small: for every 10,000 CT scans performed on children under 10 years-old, there will be one additional diagnosis of leukemia and one additional diagnosis of a brain tumor. The researchers concluded that the benefits of children having necessary CT scans outweighed the risks of later developing cancer.  A study published in May 2013 looked at children from infancy to 19 years of age in Australia and compared those who had undergone CT scans to those who had never had any. 35 Ten years after getting scanned,  there were 24% more cases of cancer among  the 680,000 children and teenagers who had CT scans than among the 10 million children and teenagers who did not undergo CT scans. Young people who had CT scans during the 12-month period before being diagnosed with cancer were not counted because the decision to scan them may have had to do with cancer symptoms.  Children 4 and under had the highest increased risk in cancer, and risk for all increased with the number of scans. The researchers concluded that for every 1,800 people under 20 who had a CT scan, there was 1 additional case of cancer that would not have occurred without the radiation from the CT scan. The CT scans in this study took place between 1985 and 2005 when radiation doses where generally higher than they are today.  Parents should make sure that CT scans ordered for their children are medically necessary and ask their doctors if lower-radiation alternatives exist. While parents should not stop their children from receiving a necessary CT scan because of radiation concerns, they should think about keeping the number of scans below age 20 to a minimum.  The FDA and investigative journalists have also released warnings about occurrence of extreme accidental overdoses of radiation from CT scans. 36 , 37  In January 2010, the FDA reported that over 250 patients at 4 facilities had received as much as 8 times the amount of radiation that they were supposed to receive. 38 Accidental radiation overdoses can result in skin redness, hair loss, increased risk of various cancers and cataracts in the future, and death.  While extreme overdoses of radiation are rare, these avoidable mistakes have lead many health professionals to call for more standardized and comprehensive methods of overseeing medical radiation. 39  ( Click here for more information on heart CT scans and cancer risk ).  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans  PET scans differ from other types of diagnostic imaging in that they allow doctors to see how an organ or system is functioning rather than just seeing the structure .  This test works in a very different way than other tests and does not use x-rays-rather, it uses gamma rays, which usually have a higher level of energy than x-rays.  PET scans work by injecting (or swallowing) small amounts of radioactive material, which then spreads throughout the body. The PET scanner is then used to detect the radiation that is emitting from the radioactive material in your body. Procedures that use radioactive material to diagnose and treat patients is referred to as “nuclear medicine.” 40  The dose of radiation from a PET scan is similar to CT, and therefore exposes people to a relatively high dose of radiation in comparison to other types of scans.  Using Radiation to Treat Cancer:  Radiation therapy  Radiation therapy uses high doses of radiation to treat various types of cancers.  Beams of radiation are directed at the cancer to kill off cancerous cells.  This can save lives and prevent recurrence of cancer, but healthy cells that are exposed to radiation may develop into a new cancer.  Fortunately, new cancers caused by radiation therapy are not thought to be very common since radiation technology can precisely irradiate a small part of the body that contains cancer, minimizing the amount of healthy cells that are exposed to radiation. 41  Another concern about radiation therapy and diagnostic tests are errors in using this technology. Although relatively uncommon, some patients will accidently receive doses that are too high.  In addition to being at increased risk of developing cancer in the future, the incorrect doses can cause serious wounds to the skin, bone, and other organs, as well as death. 42 , 43  Between 1950 and 2006, the frequency of diagnostic radiation increased 10-fold. 44 As health professionals continue to find new uses for medical devices that use radiation, people will be exposed to radiation more often. For example, many radiologists have recently started promoting the use of CT scans to screen for colon cancer (known as a virtual colonoscopy), although the FDA has not approved CT scans for this purpose. 45  Although many patients would prefer this non-invasive procedure over the traditional direct examinations, it would expose people to high doses of radiation that is roughly equal to 100 chest x-rays (or 3 years of background radiation. 46 This means more people are likely to be diagnosed with cancers that are caused by radiation than they would not have gotten otherwise.  Other Manufactured Devices that Use Radiation  Airport and Building X-ray Scans  Backscatter and millimeter scanners have begun replacing metal detectors and are designed to scan a person to determine what weapons or explosives they may have beneath their clothing. Currently, there are about 250 backscatter and 264 millimeter wave scanners in the United States. The TSA hopes to have 1,800 scanners of either type installed by the end of 2014 – which would mean that nearly every airport in the country will have one.  Backscatter scanners look like two large blue boxes:  (Source: Transportation Security Administration)  People raise their arms and stand sideways between these two boxes when they are scanned.  In contrast, millimeter wave scanners look like circular glass phone booths, and the person being scanned stands with their arms raised while part of the scanner rotates around them:  (Source: Transportation Security Administration, from http://www.tsa.gov/videos/travel-tips-advanced-imaging-technology)  If you are not sure which scanner is in use at your airport, ask a TSA official at the security checkpoint.  While metal detectors and millimeter scans both use non-ionizing radiation, which until recently was assumed to be safe (see our article Can Cell Phones Harm our Health? ), backscatter scans use ionizing radiation, which is used in x-rays and known to potentially increase the risk of cancer. Backscatter scans work a little differently from x-rays. X-rays work by sending high-energy radiation to the body and recording the radiation that passes through the body. Dense parts of the body (like bones) block some of the radiation, resulting in lighter areas on the recorded image.  Backscatter scanners also send radiation toward the body, but at much lower energy than an x-ray. Because it is not as strong as the radiation used in x-rays, the radiation does not pass through the body. Instead, the outer layers of the body “scatter” the radiation, which bounces off the body and back toward the machine. People receive most of the radiation that is absorbed by the body is deposited in the outer layers (like the skin and ribs), although a 2012 study showed that radiation from these scans may penetrate to other organs. 47 Because the radiation is concentrated in the skin, there are concerns that this could cause skin cancer.  All data on backscatter scans are provided by TSA, a government agency that does not allow independent researchers to examine the machines they use. 48 Researchers must therefore make educated guesses using data provided by the TSA, or they must make models of the scanners based on information that the agency releases.  The TSA states that backscatter scans use such low doses of radiation that estimating the potential effects of the scan is extremely difficult. 49 , 50 A 2011 report using information from the TSA found that these backscatter scans expose people to the same amount of radiation that they receive from 3 to 9 minutes of normal daily life or from 1 to 3 minutes of flight. 51 To put this into perspective, we would expect only 6 of the 100 million airline passengers each year to develop a cancer in their entire lives due to the backscatter scans.  Dr. David Brenner, a researcher at Columbia University, produced a different estimate based on the risk that the scanners are to the entire population, not just to an individual. 52 Dr. Brenner multiplied the risk associated with one scan by the number of scans conducted each year to estimate the number of people who may develop cancer in one year because of the scanners. Because up to one billion scans may be performed each year, Brenner estimated that each year 100 people would develop cancer because of their exposure.  In April 2010, a group of scientists from the University of California, San Francisco wrote a letter of concern to Dr. John Holdren, the Assistant to President Obama for Science and Technology, about the backscatter scans. These researchers pointed out that because backscatter scans only penetrate outer layers of the body, it is possible that these layers receive a higher concentration of radiation than previously believed.  The scientists also expressed concern that sperm may mutate because the testicles are close to the surface of the skin and are exposed to radiation during these backscatter scans. In addition, they noted that the effects of radiation on the cornea (the outer surface of the eye) and the thymus (a part of the immune system located in the chest) have not been studied. While this letter only outlined concerns of the scientists and did not present new data, it called for further testing of backscatter scans.  The scientists called for more rigorous and independent studies to ensure that the scans are safe for the entire population, as well as for all parts of the body.  In a joint reply with the TSA, the FDA stated that the radiation exposures from the backscatter scans were within established legal limits, even for frequent fliers. 53 In reply to the scientists’ concerns that the radiation dose to the skin would be higher, the FDA wrote that their calculations showed that a person would have to pass through the scanner 1000 times in a year in order to begin to absorb the annual limit of what is considered safe. 54  Not everyone agrees with the FDA, and some people have pointed out that TSA agents operating the scanners may improperly manage the devices or that mechanical errors may occur, either of which could cause the machines to emit more radiation than they are supposed to. From May 2010 to May 2011, there were 3,778 calls for mechanical problems on backscatter machines, but only 2% of those machines were evaluated for radiation safety. 55  For a more in-depth look at airport security and radiation, read here .  Microwaves, Cell Phones, and Other Manufactured Devices  There is still much debate among scientists about whether non-ionizing (low-energy) radiation such as microwaves can increase your risk of cancer or other health problems. The concern is not about microwave ovens, but rather the long-term exposures to microwaves from other sources, such as communication towers and cell phones. 56 Cell phones emit very low doses of microwave radiation, which was long assumed to be safe.  Although generally safer than ionizing radiation, the much longer-term exposure could make these products potentially dangerous. There are studies indicating that long-term exposures to low doses of non-ionizing radiation can damage DNA and may cause cancers and neurological and reproductive harm. 57 , 58  The rapid increase in use of cell phones and other wireless devices intensifies the need for further research on potential health effects of these non-ionizing radiation sources. Click here to get more information on cell phones and health.  Tobacco, fertilizer, welding rods, smoke detectors, and several other consumer products also contain some radiation, but radiation from these sources is generally very low (approximately 3% of our yearly radiation dose.

The accumulated exposure to 1 rem [10 mSv] of radiation, would increase that number to about 2005 or 2006.” [33]  All articles are reviewed and approved by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and other senior staff.

Researchers reevaluate the safety of radiation used in medical imaging By Carina Storrs on July 1, 2013 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: Shannon Freshwater Advertisement  Ever since physicians started regularly ordering CT (computed tomography) scans four decades ago, researchers have worried that the medical imaging procedure could increase a patient's risk of developing cancer. CT scanners bombard the human body with x-ray beams, which can damage DNA and create mutations that spur cells to grow into tumors.  Doctors have always assumed, however, that the benefits outweigh the risks. The x-rays, which rotate around the head, chest or another body part, help to create a three-dimensional image that is much more detailed than pictures from a standard x-ray machine. But a single CT scan subjects the human body to between 150 and 1,100 times the radiation of a conventional x-ray, or around a year's worth of exposure to radiation from both natural and artificial sources in the environment.  A handful of studies published in the past decade have rekindled concerns. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute estimate that 29,000 future cancer cases could be attributed to the 72 million CT scans performed in the country in 2007. That increase is equivalent to about 2 percent of the total 1.7 million cancers diagnosed nationwide every year. A 2009 study of medical centers in the San Francisco Bay Area also calculated an elevated risk: one extra case of cancer for every 400 to 2,000 routine chest CT exams.  The reliability of such predictions depends, of course, on how scientists measure the underlying link between radiation and cancer in the first place. In fact, most estimates of the excess cancer risk from CT scans over the past several decades rely largely on a potentially misleading data set: cancer rates among the long-term survivors of the atomic bomb blasts in World War II.  “There are major concerns with taking the atomic bomb survivor data and trying to understand what the risk might be to people exposed to CT scans,” says David Richardson, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health who has done research on the atomic bomb survivors.  About 25,000 atomic bomb survivors were exposed to relatively low doses of radiation comparable to between one and three CT scans. The number of cancer cases that developed over the rest of their lives is not, however, large enough to provide the necessary statistical power to reliably predict the cancer risk associated with CT scans in the general population today. Given these difficulties, as well as renewed concerns about radiation levels and the lack of mandatory standards for safe CT exposure (in contrast to such procedures as mammography), a dozen groups of investigators around the world have decided to reevaluate the risk of CT radiation based on more complete evidence.  A growing number of clinicians and medical associations are not waiting for definitive results about health risks and have already begun figuring out how to reduce radiation levels. Two radiologists at Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, think that they can decrease the x-ray dosage of at least one common type of CT scan by 75 percent without significantly reducing image quality. Likewise, a few medical associations are trying to limit superfluous imaging and prevent clinicians from using too much radiation when CT scanning is necessary.  Outdated Data  For obvious ethical reasons, researchers cannot irradiate people solely to estimate the cancer risk of CT. So scientists turned to data about survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people died during the detonations and in the months following them. Most individuals within one kilometer of the bombings perished from acute radiation poisoning, falling debris or fires that erupted in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Some people within 2.5 kilometers of ground zero lived for years after exposure to varying levels of gamma rays, from a high end of more than three sieverts (Sv)—which can burn skin and cause hair loss—to a low end of five millisieverts (mSv), which is in the middle of the typical range for CT scans today (2 to 10 mSv). A sievert is an international unit for measuring the effects of different kinds of radiation on living tissue: 1 Sv of gamma rays causes the same amount of tissue damage as 1 Sv of x-rays.  Several years after the blasts, researchers began tracking rates of disease and death among more than 120,000 survivors. The results demonstrated, for the first time, that the cancer risk from radiation depends on the dose and that even very small doses can up the odds. Based on such data, a 2006 report from the National Research Council has estimated that exposure to 10 mSv—the approximate dose from a CT scan of the abdomen—increases the lifetime risk of developing any cancer by 0.1 percent. Using the same basic information, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that 10 mSv increases the risk of a fatal cancer by 0.05 percent. Because these risks are tiny compared with the natural incidence of cancer in the general population, they do not seem alarming. Any one person in the U.S. has a 20 percent chance of dying from cancer. Therefore, a single CT scan increases the average patient's risk of developing a fatal tumor from 20 to 20.05 percent.  All these estimates share a serious flaw. Among survivors exposed to 100 mSv of radiation or less—including the doses typical for CT scans—the numbers of cancer cases and deaths are so small that it becomes virtually impossible to be certain that they are significantly higher than the rate of cancer in the general population. To compensate, the National Research Council and others based their estimates primarily on data from survivors who were exposed to levels of radiation in the range of 100 mSv to 2 Sv. The fundamental assumption is that cancer risk and radiation dose have a similar relationship in high and low ranges—but that is not necessarily true.  Another complicating factor is that the atomic bombs exposed people's entire body to one large blast of gamma rays, whereas many patients receive multiple CT scans that concentrate several x-rays on one region of their body, making accurate comparisons tricky. Compounding this issue, the atomic bomb survivors typically had much poorer nutrition and less access to medical care compared with today's general U.S. population. Thus, the same level of radiation might correspond to greater illness in an atomic bomb survivor than in an otherwise healthy person from today.  Dialing Down the Dose  To conclusively determine the risk of low radiation doses and set new safety standards for CT radiation, researchers are beginning to abandon the atomic bomb survivor data and directly investigate the number of cancers among people who have received CT scans. About a dozen such studies from different countries examining rates of various cancers following CT scans will be published in the next few years.  In the meantime, some researchers have started testing whether good images can be produced with radiation doses lower than those generated in typical CT scans. Sarabjeet Singh, a radiologist at Mass General, and his fellow radiologist Mannudeep Kalra have an unusual way of conducting such investigations. Rather than recruiting living, breathing human volunteers for their studies, they work with cadavers. In that way, they can scan bodies many times without worrying about making people sick and can perform an autopsy to check whether the scan has correctly identified a medical problem.  So far the researchers have discovered that they can diagnose certain abnormal growths in the lungs and perform routine chest exams with about 75 percent less radiation than usual—a strategy Mass General has since adopted. Singh and Kalra are now sharing their methods with radiologists and technologists from hospitals and scanning centers across the U.S. and around the globe.  Medical associations are stepping in to help as well. Because the FDA does not regulate how CT scanners are used or set dose limits, different centers end up using an array of radiation doses—some of which seem unnecessarily high. In the past year the American Association of Physicists in Medicine has rolled out standardized procedures for adult CT exams that should rein in some of these outlier centers, Singh says. Furthermore, an increasing number of CT facilities across the U.S. receive accreditation from the American College of Radiology, which sets limits for radiation doses and evaluates image quality. In 2012 accreditation became mandatory for outpatient clinics that accept Medicare Part B if the facilities want to get reimbursed for scans.  No matter how much clinicians lower the levels of radiation used in individual CT exams, however, a problem remains. Many people still receive unnecessary CT scans and, along with them, unneeded doses of radiation. Bruce Hillman of the University of Virginia and other researchers worry that emergency room physicians in particular order too many CT scans, making quick decisions in high-pressure situations. In a 2004 poll 91 percent of ER doctors did not think a CT scan posed any cancer risk. Doctors and their patients may finally be getting the message. A 2012 analysis of Medicare data suggests that the previously rampant growth in CT procedures is flattening out and possibly waning.  “The jury is still out on whether there is a small cancer risk,” says Donald Frush, chief of pediatric radiology at Duke University Medical Center. “But the safest thing is to assume that no amount of radiation is safe. And if we find out in 20 years that a little bit was not harmful, then what did we lose by trying to minimize the dose?”   This article was originally published with the title "Do CT Scans Cause Cancer?"

The main risks are those associated with test results that demonstrate a benign or incidental finding , leading to unneeded, possibly invasive, follow-up tests that may present additional risks and the increased possibility of cancer induction from x-ray radiation exposure. The probability for absorbed x-rays to induce cancer or heritable mutations leading to genetically associated diseases in offspring is thought to be very small for radiation doses of the magnitude that are associated with CT procedures. Such estimates of cancer and genetically heritable risk from x-ray exposure have a broad range of statistical uncertainty, and there is some scientific controversy regarding the effects from very low doses and dose rates as discussed below. To date, there is no evidence of genetically heritable risk in humans from exposure to x-rays.  Under some rare circumstances of prolonged, high-dose exposure, x-rays can cause other adverse health effects, such as skin erythema (reddening), skin tissue injury, and birth defects following in-utero exposure. But at the exposure levels associated with most medical imaging procedures, including most CT procedures, these other adverse effects do not occur. Because of the rapidly growing use of pediatric CT and the potential for increased radiation exposure to children undergoing these scans, special considerations should be applied when using pediatric CT. Among children who have undergone CT scans, approximately one-third have had at least three scans. The National Cancer Institute and The Society for Pediatric Radiology developed a brochure, Radiation Risks and Pediatric Computed Tomography: A Guide for Health Care Providers , and the FDA issued a Public Health Notification, Reducing Radiation Risk from Computed Tomography for Pediatric and Small Adult Patients , that discuss the value of CT and the importance of minimizing the radiation dose, especially in children. See a recent article from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) titled, "Computed Tomography (CT) - An Increasing Source of Radiation Exposure" . Radiation Dose from CT Examinations The quantity most relevant for assessing the risk of cancer detriment from a CT procedure is the "effective dose" . The unit of measurement for effective dose is millisieverts (abbreviated mSv). Effective dose allows for comparison of the risk estimates associated with partial or whole-body radiation exposures. It also incorporates the different radiation sensitivities of the various organs in the body. Radiation dose from CT procedures varies from patient to patient. The particular radiation dose will depend on the size of the body part examined, the type of procedure, and the type of CT equipment and its operation. Typical values cited for radiation dose should be considered as estimates that cannot be precisely associated with any individual patient, examination, or type of CT system. The actual dose from a procedure could be two or three times larger or smaller than the estimates. Facilities performing "screening" procedures may adjust the radiation dose used to levels less (by factors such as 1/2 to 1/5 for so called "low dose CT scans") than those typically used for diagnostic CT procedures. However, no comprehensive data is available to permit estimation of the extent of this practice and reducing the dose can have an adverse impact on the image quality produced. Such reduced image quality may be acceptable in certain imaging applications. Estimates of the effective dose from a diagnostic CT procedure can vary by a factor of 10 or more depending on the type of CT procedure, patient size and the CT system and its operating technique. A list of representative diagnostic procedures and associated doses are given in Table 1. Table 1 - Radiation Dose Comparisons Diagnostic Procedure Typical Effective Dose (mSv) 1  Chest x-ray (PA film) 0.02 Lumbar spine 1.5 I.V. urogram 3 Upper G.I. exam 6 Barium enema 8 CT head 2 CT chest 7 CT abdomen 8 Coronary artery calcification CT 3 Coronary CT angiogram 16 1. Average effective dose in millisieverts (mSv) from McCollough CH, Bushberg JT, Fletcher JG, Eckel LJ. Answers to common questions about the use and safety of CT scans. Mayo Clin Proc. 2015;90(10):1380-92. The effective doses from diagnostic CT procedures are typically estimated to be in the range of 1 to 10 mSv. This range is not much less than the lowest doses of 5 to 20 mSv received by some of the Japanese survivors of the atomic bombs. These survivors, who are estimated to have experienced doses only slightly larger than those encountered in CT, have demonstrated a small but increased radiation-related excess relative risk for cancer mortality . Risk Estimates The effective doses from diagnostic CT procedures are typically estimated to be in the range of 1 to 10 mSv. This range is not much less than the lowest doses of 5 to 20 mSv estimated to have been received by some of the Japanese survivors of the atomic bombs. These survivors, who are estimated to have experienced doses slightly larger than those encountered in CT, have demonstrated a small but increased radiation-related excess relative risk for cancer mortality. The risk of developing cancer as a result of exposure to radiation depends on the part of the body exposed, the individual’s age at exposure, and the individual’s gender. For the purpose of radiation protection, a conservative approach that is generally used is to assume that the risk for adverse health effects from cancer is proportional to the amount of radiation dose absorbed and that there is no amount of radiation that is completely without risk. This conservative approach is called the “linear non-threshold” model. The amount of dose depends on the type of x-ray examination . A CT examination with an effective dose of 10 millisieverts (abbreviated mSv; 1 mSv = 1 mGy in the case of x-rays.) may be associated with an increase in the possibility of fatal cancer of approximately 1 chance in 2000. This increase in the possibility of a fatal cancer from radiation can be compared to the natural incidence of fatal cancer in the U.S. population, about 1 chance in 5 (equal to 400 chances in 2000). In other words, for any one person the risk of radiation-induced cancer is much smaller than the natural risk of cancer. If you combine the natural risk of a fatal cancer and the estimated risk from a 10 mSv CT scan, the total risk may increase from 400 chances in 2000 to 401 chances in 2000. Nevertheless, this small increase in radiation-associated cancer risk for an individual can become a public health concern if large numbers of people undergo increased numbers of CT screening procedures of uncertain benefit. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the risk estimates for low levels of radiation exposure as commonly experienced in diagnostic radiology procedures. This is because the risk is quite low compared to the natural risk of cancer. At low doses, the radiation-related excess risk, which is thought to be proportional to dose, tends to be dwarfed by statistical and other variation in the background risk level. To obtain adequate evidence for a statistically valid estimate of cancer risk from exposure to low doses of radiation would require studying millions of people for many years. There are some who question whether there is adequate evidence for a risk of cancer induction at low doses. Some scientists believe that low doses of radiation do not increase the risk of developing cancer at all, but this is a minority view.

Megan Alcalay   Health           Did you know? Medical procedures amount to 96% of man-made radiation that humans are exposed to. Wow. Studies show that radiation exposure from imaging tests, like x-rays or CT scans, is never safe. Yet, these tests provide valuable information about your health, and allow your physician to make accurate diagnoses. X-rays and CT scans are necessary tools in medicine... they are also classified as carcinogens. X-ray medical tests have been around for 120 years, when it was discovered that producing a concentrated beam of electrons through the body onto metal film resulted in an internal image of the body. CT scans were developed in the 1970’s and consist of multiple x-rays and thus significantly higher radiation exposure. The radiation emitted during these procedures is called ionizing radiation – radiation with so much energy, that during interaction with an atom, removes electrons from the atom’s orbit. The atom becomes charged or ionized. When this occurs within the human body, the cell either dies, repairs itself, or mutates incorrectly and can become cancerous. Your Normal Medical Exposure and Associated Risk Numerous studies have validated the positive correlation between radiation exposure and cancer risk. Based on these studies, the FDA estimates that exposure to 10 millisieverts (mSv) from an x-ray or CT scan increases the risk of death from cancer by 1 in 2000 (.05%) , a relatively small amount. According to cancer.org , a “study in England of exposure to radiation from CT scans found that children who received a dose of at least 30 mSv to the bone marrow had 3 times the risk of leukemia compared to those who received a dose of 5 mSv or less. For brain tumors, a dose of 50 mSv or more to the brain was linked to more than 3 times the risk.” The average radiation exposure per x-ray is .28 mSv . You would need approximately 36 x-rays throughout your lifetime to raise your risk of cancer by .05% . The average radiation exposure per CT scan is 6.3 mSv . After approximately two CT scans, your risk of cancer increases by .05% . CT scans are far more risky than x-rays, yet they are a noninvasive way to study all parts of the body and assist doctors in diagnosing and treating vascular diseases, cancer, spinal problems, internal injuries, trauma and more. [Note: MRI’s, another common diagnostic tool, do not use ionizing radiation. ] Some Perspective – Airport Scanners The most common airport scanners – the old-school metal detectors and new-school millimeter scanners (the plastic booth) – do not use ionizing radiation . Backscatter scanners (where you stand between the two boxes) average between 0.00005 to 0.0001 mSv per scan. You would need 1,000 to 2,000 airport (backscatter) scans to get a dose equivalent to a single chest x-ray ! Is there a definitive threshold where x-rays go from safe to dangerous? Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. There is no scientifically validated number of x-rays or CT scans that you are granted in your lifetime without risk of harm. Each test varies in its levels of emitted radiation, and tissues and organs vary in sensitivity to the radiation exposure. But, here’s a very helpful chart that provides details about common imaging tests and their corresponding effective radiation doses. The Bottom Line | TL;DR To optimize your longevity and vitality, we recommend avoiding known carcinogens, including radiation, whenever possible . We encourage you to be informed about your tests, understand how much lifetime medical radiation you’ve been exposed to, and be cautious and inquisitive with young children and radiation exposure. However, remember it takes almost 40 x-rays or two CT scans to increase your risk of cancer by .05%. When requested by a physician as a medical tool, you shouldn’t be scared of medical x-rays or CT scans as a cancer risk . Take Initiative With Medical Radiation Ask questions. Ask your physician why an imaging test will help them determine your treatment. If your doctor explains why it is needed, do not refuse an x-ray or CT scan. In many situations, the risk of not getting a scan (and thus proper treatment) far outweighs the risk of the radiation exposure. Don’t insist on an x-ray or CT scan. Sometimes physicians will order an x-ray because their patient insists on one. Don’t be this patient. Allow your physician to do their job. If you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Radiation exposure is riskier to an unborn baby than to an adult. If pregnant and in need of an imaging test, clearly understand the risks and ask if there are ways to protect the developing fetus. Ask if a gonad shield can be used. Often there are ways to shield the more sensitive tissues and organs. Stay informed to minimize your cancer risk. We are surrounded by carcinogens. There is no scientific evidence enabling us to pinpoint exactly what will keep us healthy and what will make us ill. However, study after study points to actions we can take daily to maintain harmony in our environment, from lifestyle choices, to diet and stress reduction.

Radiation from the Environment  Background radiation  Background radiation refers to radiation that naturally occurs in our environment and does not come from any manufactured devices.  Radiation is emitted from the earth, sun, our galaxy, and other galaxies.  Even the human body naturally contains some radioactive elements. 8  People who receive few or no high-dose radiation medical tests usually get more exposure to radiation from the natural environment than from any manufactured device. 9  This is because we are constantly exposed to a very low dose radiation for our whole lives, while devices such as x-ray tests expose you to radiation for a very short period of time.  On the other hand, one CT scan can be equal to several years of background radiation exposures, so many people receive much higher doses of radiation from medical devices than they do from the natural environment.  The risk of developing cancer from a lifetime exposure of background radiation is about 1 in 100, or 1% of the population. 10 It is impossible to avoid all background radiation, but the best ways to limit unnecessary exposure to radiation from the environment is to prevent your exposure to radon and repeated unprotected sun exposure.  Radon  Radon is a color less, odorless gas that comes from decaying rocks and soil.  For the average person, radon accounts for over half their annual exposure to radiation.  Radon comes up from the ground and gets trapped in houses and buildings.  Exposure to a small amount of radon inside is normal, but high levels can cause lung cancer.  Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer (smoking is the leading cause), and approximately 1 in every 15 houses have too much radon.  The only way to know if you have a safe level of radon in your house is to get it tested. 11  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation is radiation that comes from the galaxy and from the earth.  It makes up about 8% of our average yearly exposure to radiation. 12 Cosmic radiation includes ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun that cause tans and sunburns.  UV rays can also damage the DNA in our skin cells and lead to skin cancer. 13 Although we cannot avoid UV rays all the time, limiting exposure to direct sun light can reduce your risk of skin cancer.  Tanning beds are also a common source of UV radiation and are just as dangerous as radiation from the sun.  For more information on tanning beds, please read: Tanning Beds: Safe Alternative to Sun?  Being at higher altitudes, such as flying on a plane or living in a “mile high” location, will exposure you to higher levels of cosmic radiation than being at sea level.  While there is technically no “safe” dose of ionizing radiation, the chances of getting cancer from frequent plane trips is very slim.  Studies of airline crew members have not found a significant increase in risk of cancer after many years of working on airplane. 14  In addition, living in Denver or other high altitude locations that receive higher doses of cosmic radiation has not been shown to increase the risk of cancer. 15   How to Reduce Radiation Exposure from the Environment  Radon :  Test the level of radon inside your house to make sure it is not too high.  You can hire a professional to do this or you can purchase a “do-it-yourself” radon testing kit.  It generally takes only a few minutes and is easy to do.  If there is too high a level of radon in your house, people usually install an active soil depressurization (ASD) system, which is basically a ventilation system. 2  UV Radiation: Some of the best ways to reduce your exposure to harmful UV rays are to:   Wear sunscreen (at least SPF 15) year-round in all areas of your body that are exposed to the sun. (However, it is good to get vitamin D from the sun for 15 minutes each day.)  Stay in the shade, especially when the sun is at it’s strongest (between 10am and 4pm)  Wear protective clothing, such as broad-brimmed hats and tightly-woven clothes that cover your hands and legs.    Medical Devices that Use Radiation  X-rays  X-rays use ionizing radiation and are used for many types of diagnostic tests such as CT scans, mammograms, fluoroscopy, and simple x-rays.  These tests allow your doctor to see potential problems inside your body and choose an appropriate treatment.  They can help doctors make life-saving decisions, but some doctors are performing unnecessary scans or are using doses of radiation that are too high. 16 Since x-rays use ionizing radiation, they can cause damage to our cells and DNA. X-ray tests can lead to cancer, but several common tests (such as mammograms and bone x-rays) use very low doses that have not been shown to cause a significant increased risk of cancer when administered properly.  Over the past few decades, the average level of radiation that Americans are exposed to has increased rapidly due to increased use of medical diagnostic tests such as x-rays (including dental x-rays and mammograms) and CT scans and cancer treatments.  Diagnostic tests and treatments can help improve patients’ quality and length of life, but there are also risks.  Usually, the benefit of receiving one of these tests outweighs the risk, but patients and doctors need to be wary of performing unnecessary tests, particularly if the test uses high doses of radiation.  Not all imaging tests use radiation that has been linked to cancer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) and ultrasounds do not use x-rays.  Instead, they use non-ionizing radiation and have not been found to increase the risk of cancer or other health problems. 17  MRIs and Ultrasounds are a safer alternative to diagnostics tests that use x-rays or other ionizing radiation.  Children, young adults, and fetuses of pregnant women should be particularly careful about getting any x-ray tests.  Children, young adults, and fetuses are more sensitive to radiation, and their young age also allows a longer period of time for cancer to develop. 18 , 19 , 20  Pregnant women should avoid any x-ray exposure, particularly when they are less than 20 weeks pregnant, since radiation exposure in the womb can lead to mental retardation, growth retardation, leukemia, and other cancers later in life. 21 If it is necessary for a pregnant women to be x-rayed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states a single x-ray test does not harm the fetus, but a protective lead apron should be used to cover the abdomen. 22 However, high-dose, multiple-dose, or x-rays of the pelvic region should be avoided for pregnant women, whenever possible.  Many people get simple x-ray tests, such as an arm, leg, chest, or dental x-ray that look for broken bones or other problems.  Simple x-ray tests use very low doses of radiation, 23   and studies have not found an increase risk of cancer among humans who have received a very low dose of radiation. 24 Although the dose of radiation used to x-ray different parts of the body will vary, most simple x-rays use less radiation than other types of x-ray scans (such as a mammogram or CT scan).  Mammograms  Mammograms are an x-ray test that is used to detect breast cancer.  This test uses a higher dose of radiation than a simple x-ray, but less than a CT scan or Fluoroscopy.  According to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, a woman above age 50 who is at average risk of breast cancer should get a mammogram test once every two years  until age 74 . 25 These new guidelines would expose women to less than half the amount of radiation from mammograms than following previous recommendations (which included annual mammograms starting at age 40 for women at average risk).  While these doses of radiation could cause new cases of breast cancer, the appropriate use of mammograms has resulted in lives saved, and the benefits of getting regular mammograms are likely to be even greater than the risks when the frequency of mammograms is reduced to every other year.  Women who are carriers of the BRCA genetic mutation were previously recommended to begin yearly mammograms at age 25-30, since this mutation puts them at much higher risk of getting breast cancer.  Newer studies have found that starting yearly mammograms before age 35 has no benefit to these women and may instead be harmful.  They end up with higher exposure to radiation over their lifetime, which increases the chance of getting radiation-induced breast cancer that they may not have gotten otherwise. 26  Fluoroscopy  Fluoroscopyis an x-ray test that allows doctors to see a continuous x-ray image of your body (like a movie, rather than just a picture as with other x-ray tests).  Fluoroscopy uses an x-ray absorbing dye that is either drunk or injected into the body, which allows doctors to see a better outline of the organ.  This procedure is used to view the digestive system (such as stomach, kidneys, or colon), arteries, or joints. 27  Since this test sends x-ray beams over an extended period of time (usually 20-60 minutes), 28 it exposes people to much higher doses of radiation than a simple x-ray test, although the doses vary widely depending on the test.  Fluoroscopy and CT scans both use high doses of radiation and pose the greatest and most avoidable risk of radiation-induced cancer.  Limiting the number of CT and fluoroscopy tests you receive is one of the best ways you can avoid getting cancer from radiation.  In addition to increasing cancer risk, this test can damage the skin and cause burns. 29  Computed Tomographic (CT) scans  CT Scans are a relatively new type of diagnostic imaging technology that allows doctors to view 3-dimentional pictures of various organs in your body.  CT scans use higher doses of radiation than most other types of diagnostic test and are likely to cause new cancers in some patients, compared to their risk if they had not received a CT scan.  Today, an American’s average lifetime dose of radiation from diagnostic procedures is six times higher than it was in the 1980s. 30 This is largely due to the increased use of CT scans. Everyday, 19,500 CT scans are performed in the U.S. and this number continues to climb. Each CT scan is equivalent to 30 – 442 chest x-rays, depending on the dose used for the CT scan. 31 One study projected that CT scans performed in the U.S. in 2007 alone will result in 29,000 new cancer cases and roughly 15,000 deaths that would not have occurred if they had not received a CT scan. 32 These risks would increase with each additional CT scan a person receives.  Low-dose CT scans, which expose patients to less radiation, are now being used to screen for lung cancer, with concerns about whether the benefits outweigh the risks.  For more information on low-dose CTs, click here .  Unfortunately, there is no established guideline for how much radiation should be used for each procedure.  Different scans require different levels of radiation in order to get a clear image, but some doctors are using more radiation than is necessary.  One study found that different medical facilities had huge variations in the dose of radiation used for the same procedure.  On average, the highest dose given for a CT scan was 13 times higher than the lowest does given for the same type of scan. 33 The researchers found no pattern in why this dose variation occurred, and no scientific justification.  Children’s exposure to radiation from CT scans is particularly worrisome because children have many more years to develop cancer than adults receiving CT scans and are more sensitive to the effects of radiation.  A June 2012 study found that children receiving higher doses of radiation — through multiple CT scans– were more likely to develop brain tumors and leukemia than children who had only one CT scan. 34 However, brain tumors and leukemia are very rare conditions and the increased risk due to CT scans was relatively small: for every 10,000 CT scans performed on children under 10 years-old, there will be one additional diagnosis of leukemia and one additional diagnosis of a brain tumor. The researchers concluded that the benefits of children having necessary CT scans outweighed the risks of later developing cancer.  A study published in May 2013 looked at children from infancy to 19 years of age in Australia and compared those who had undergone CT scans to those who had never had any. 35 Ten years after getting scanned,  there were 24% more cases of cancer among  the 680,000 children and teenagers who had CT scans than among the 10 million children and teenagers who did not undergo CT scans. Young people who had CT scans during the 12-month period before being diagnosed with cancer were not counted because the decision to scan them may have had to do with cancer symptoms.  Children 4 and under had the highest increased risk in cancer, and risk for all increased with the number of scans. The researchers concluded that for every 1,800 people under 20 who had a CT scan, there was 1 additional case of cancer that would not have occurred without the radiation from the CT scan. The CT scans in this study took place between 1985 and 2005 when radiation doses where generally higher than they are today.  Parents should make sure that CT scans ordered for their children are medically necessary and ask their doctors if lower-radiation alternatives exist. While parents should not stop their children from receiving a necessary CT scan because of radiation concerns, they should think about keeping the number of scans below age 20 to a minimum.  The FDA and investigative journalists have also released warnings about occurrence of extreme accidental overdoses of radiation from CT scans. 36 , 37  In January 2010, the FDA reported that over 250 patients at 4 facilities had received as much as 8 times the amount of radiation that they were supposed to receive. 38 Accidental radiation overdoses can result in skin redness, hair loss, increased risk of various cancers and cataracts in the future, and death.  While extreme overdoses of radiation are rare, these avoidable mistakes have lead many health professionals to call for more standardized and comprehensive methods of overseeing medical radiation. 39  ( Click here for more information on heart CT scans and cancer risk ).  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans  PET scans differ from other types of diagnostic imaging in that they allow doctors to see how an organ or system is functioning rather than just seeing the structure .  This test works in a very different way than other tests and does not use x-rays-rather, it uses gamma rays, which usually have a higher level of energy than x-rays.  PET scans work by injecting (or swallowing) small amounts of radioactive material, which then spreads throughout the body. The PET scanner is then used to detect the radiation that is emitting from the radioactive material in your body. Procedures that use radioactive material to diagnose and treat patients is referred to as “nuclear medicine.” 40  The dose of radiation from a PET scan is similar to CT, and therefore exposes people to a relatively high dose of radiation in comparison to other types of scans.  Using Radiation to Treat Cancer:  Radiation therapy  Radiation therapy uses high doses of radiation to treat various types of cancers.  Beams of radiation are directed at the cancer to kill off cancerous cells.  This can save lives and prevent recurrence of cancer, but healthy cells that are exposed to radiation may develop into a new cancer.  Fortunately, new cancers caused by radiation therapy are not thought to be very common since radiation technology can precisely irradiate a small part of the body that contains cancer, minimizing the amount of healthy cells that are exposed to radiation. 41  Another concern about radiation therapy and diagnostic tests are errors in using this technology. Although relatively uncommon, some patients will accidently receive doses that are too high.  In addition to being at increased risk of developing cancer in the future, the incorrect doses can cause serious wounds to the skin, bone, and other organs, as well as death. 42 , 43  Between 1950 and 2006, the frequency of diagnostic radiation increased 10-fold. 44 As health professionals continue to find new uses for medical devices that use radiation, people will be exposed to radiation more often. For example, many radiologists have recently started promoting the use of CT scans to screen for colon cancer (known as a virtual colonoscopy), although the FDA has not approved CT scans for this purpose. 45  Although many patients would prefer this non-invasive procedure over the traditional direct examinations, it would expose people to high doses of radiation that is roughly equal to 100 chest x-rays (or 3 years of background radiation. 46 This means more people are likely to be diagnosed with cancers that are caused by radiation than they would not have gotten otherwise.  Other Manufactured Devices that Use Radiation  Airport and Building X-ray Scans  Backscatter and millimeter scanners have begun replacing metal detectors and are designed to scan a person to determine what weapons or explosives they may have beneath their clothing. Currently, there are about 250 backscatter and 264 millimeter wave scanners in the United States. The TSA hopes to have 1,800 scanners of either type installed by the end of 2014 – which would mean that nearly every airport in the country will have one.  Backscatter scanners look like two large blue boxes:  (Source: Transportation Security Administration)  People raise their arms and stand sideways between these two boxes when they are scanned.  In contrast, millimeter wave scanners look like circular glass phone booths, and the person being scanned stands with their arms raised while part of the scanner rotates around them:  (Source: Transportation Security Administration, from http://www.tsa.gov/videos/travel-tips-advanced-imaging-technology)  If you are not sure which scanner is in use at your airport, ask a TSA official at the security checkpoint.  While metal detectors and millimeter scans both use non-ionizing radiation, which until recently was assumed to be safe (see our article Can Cell Phones Harm our Health? ), backscatter scans use ionizing radiation, which is used in x-rays and known to potentially increase the risk of cancer. Backscatter scans work a little differently from x-rays. X-rays work by sending high-energy radiation to the body and recording the radiation that passes through the body. Dense parts of the body (like bones) block some of the radiation, resulting in lighter areas on the recorded image.  Backscatter scanners also send radiation toward the body, but at much lower energy than an x-ray. Because it is not as strong as the radiation used in x-rays, the radiation does not pass through the body. Instead, the outer layers of the body “scatter” the radiation, which bounces off the body and back toward the machine. People receive most of the radiation that is absorbed by the body is deposited in the outer layers (like the skin and ribs), although a 2012 study showed that radiation from these scans may penetrate to other organs. 47 Because the radiation is concentrated in the skin, there are concerns that this could cause skin cancer.  All data on backscatter scans are provided by TSA, a government agency that does not allow independent researchers to examine the machines they use. 48 Researchers must therefore make educated guesses using data provided by the TSA, or they must make models of the scanners based on information that the agency releases.  The TSA states that backscatter scans use such low doses of radiation that estimating the potential effects of the scan is extremely difficult. 49 , 50 A 2011 report using information from the TSA found that these backscatter scans expose people to the same amount of radiation that they receive from 3 to 9 minutes of normal daily life or from 1 to 3 minutes of flight. 51 To put this into perspective, we would expect only 6 of the 100 million airline passengers each year to develop a cancer in their entire lives due to the backscatter scans.  Dr. David Brenner, a researcher at Columbia University, produced a different estimate based on the risk that the scanners are to the entire population, not just to an individual. 52 Dr. Brenner multiplied the risk associated with one scan by the number of scans conducted each year to estimate the number of people who may develop cancer in one year because of the scanners. Because up to one billion scans may be performed each year, Brenner estimated that each year 100 people would develop cancer because of their exposure.  In April 2010, a group of scientists from the University of California, San Francisco wrote a letter of concern to Dr. John Holdren, the Assistant to President Obama for Science and Technology, about the backscatter scans. These researchers pointed out that because backscatter scans only penetrate outer layers of the body, it is possible that these layers receive a higher concentration of radiation than previously believed.  The scientists also expressed concern that sperm may mutate because the testicles are close to the surface of the skin and are exposed to radiation during these backscatter scans. In addition, they noted that the effects of radiation on the cornea (the outer surface of the eye) and the thymus (a part of the immune system located in the chest) have not been studied. While this letter only outlined concerns of the scientists and did not present new data, it called for further testing of backscatter scans.  The scientists called for more rigorous and independent studies to ensure that the scans are safe for the entire population, as well as for all parts of the body.  In a joint reply with the TSA, the FDA stated that the radiation exposures from the backscatter scans were within established legal limits, even for frequent fliers. 53 In reply to the scientists’ concerns that the radiation dose to the skin would be higher, the FDA wrote that their calculations showed that a person would have to pass through the scanner 1000 times in a year in order to begin to absorb the annual limit of what is considered safe. 54  Not everyone agrees with the FDA, and some people have pointed out that TSA agents operating the scanners may improperly manage the devices or that mechanical errors may occur, either of which could cause the machines to emit more radiation than they are supposed to. From May 2010 to May 2011, there were 3,778 calls for mechanical problems on backscatter machines, but only 2% of those machines were evaluated for radiation safety. 55  For a more in-depth look at airport security and radiation, read here .  Microwaves, Cell Phones, and Other Manufactured Devices  There is still much debate among scientists about whether non-ionizing (low-energy) radiation such as microwaves can increase your risk of cancer or other health problems. The concern is not about microwave ovens, but rather the long-term exposures to microwaves from other sources, such as communication towers and cell phones. 56 Cell phones emit very low doses of microwave radiation, which was long assumed to be safe.  Although generally safer than ionizing radiation, the much longer-term exposure could make these products potentially dangerous. There are studies indicating that long-term exposures to low doses of non-ionizing radiation can damage DNA and may cause cancers and neurological and reproductive harm. 57 , 58  The rapid increase in use of cell phones and other wireless devices intensifies the need for further research on potential health effects of these non-ionizing radiation sources. Click here to get more information on cell phones and health.  Tobacco, fertilizer, welding rods, smoke detectors, and several other consumer products also contain some radiation, but radiation from these sources is generally very low (approximately 3% of our yearly radiation dose.

The accumulated exposure to 1 rem [10 mSv] of radiation, would increase that number to about 2005 or 2006.” [33]  All articles are reviewed and approved by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and other senior staff.

Signs and Symptoms of Bone Cancer    Tests for Bone Cancer    Bone Cancer Stages    Survival Statistics for Bone Cancer    Questions To Ask About Bone Cancer             Bone Cancer  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging             Tests for Bone Cancer      Symptoms, a physical exam, and the results of imaging tests , and blood tests might suggest that a person has bone cancer . But in most cases, doctors must confirm this  by testing a tissue or cell sample and checking it with a microscope (a procedure known as a biopsy ).  Accurate diagnosis of a bone tumor often depends on combining information about what bone is affected and which part of the bone is involved, how it looks on x-rays, and what the cells look like under a microscope.   Other diseases, like bone infections, can cause symptoms and imaging results that might be confused with bone cancer.  Bone metastasis can also look like primary bone cancer. Bone tumors are more often caused by cancer that has spread to the bone from some other part of the body. This is a bone metastasis. A single bone metastasis can have the same signs and symptoms as a primary bone tumor, so many doctors require a biopsy to diagnose a patient’s first bone metastasis. After that, new bone metastases can usually be diagnosed based on x-rays and other imaging tests.  Imaging tests  X-rays  Most bone cancers show up on x-rays of the bone. The bone at the site of the cancer may look “ragged” instead of solid. The cancer can also appear as a hole in the bone. Sometimes doctors can see a tumor around the defect in the bone that might extend into nearby tissues (such as muscle or fat). The radiologist (doctor who specializes in reading x-rays) can often tell if a tumor is malignant by the way it appears on the x-ray, but only a biopsy can tell for sure.  A chest x-ray is often done to see if bone cancer has spread to the lungs.  Computed tomography (CT) scans  CT scans are helpful in staging cancer . They help show if the bone cancer has spread to your lungs, liver, or other organs. The scans show the lymph nodes and distant organs where there might be cancer spread.  CT scans can also be used to guide a biopsy needle into a tumor. This is called a CT-guided needle biopsy. For this test, you stay on the CT scanning table while a radiologist moves a biopsy needle toward the tumor. CT scans are repeated until the tip of the needle is within the mass. (See Needle biopsy below.)  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans  MRI scans are often the best test for outlining a bone tumor. They are very helpful for looking at the brain and spinal cord.  Radionuclide bone scans  Bone scans can show if a cancer has spread to other bones. It can find smaller areas of metastasis than regular x-rays. Bone scans also can show how much damage the cancer has caused in the bone.  Areas of diseased bone will be seen on the bone scan as dense, gray to black areas, called “hot spots.” These areas suggest  cancer is present, but arthritis, infection, or other bone diseases can also cause hot spots. Other imaging tests or a bone biopsy may be needed to know what's causing the change.  Positron emission tomography (PET or PET) scans  PET scans use glucose (a form of sugar) that's attached to a radioactive atom. A special camera can detect the radioactivity. Cancer cells absorb a lot of the radioactive sugar because of their high rate of metabolism. PET scans are useful in looking for cancer throughout your entire body. It can sometimes help tell if a tumor is cancer or not cancer (benign). It's often combined with CT scans to better pinpoint some kinds of cancer.  Biopsy  A biopsy takes a piece of tissue  from a tumor so that it can be looked at with a microscope and tested in the lab. This is the only way to know that the tumor is cancer and not another bone disease.  If it is cancer, the biopsy can tell the doctor if it's a primary bone cancer or cancer that started somewhere else and spread to the bone (metastasis). Many  types of tissue and cell samples are used to diagnose bone cancer. It's very important that your biopsy be done by a surgeon with experience in diagnosing and treating bone tumors.  The type of biopsy done is based on whether the tumor looks benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer) and exactly what type of tumor it most likely is (based on  x-rays, the patient’s age, and where the tumor is). Some kinds of bone tumors can be diagnosed from needle biopsy samples, but larger samples (from a surgical biopsy) are often needed to diagnose other types.  Whether the surgeon plans to remove the entire tumor during the  biopsy will also impact the type of biopsy done. Sometimes the wrong kind of biopsy can  make it hard  for the surgeon to later remove all of the cancer without having to also remove all or part of the arm or leg containing the tumor. It also may cause the cancer to spread.  Needle biopsy  There are 2 types of needle biopsies: fine (aspiration) and core . For both types, a drug is first used to numb the area for the biopsy.  For fine needle aspiration (FNA), the doctor uses a very thin needle and a syringe to take out a small amount of fluid and some cells from the tumor. Sometimes, the doctor can aim the needle by feeling the  tumor if it's near the surface of the body. If the tumor  is too deep to feel, the doctor can guide the needle while looking a CT scan. This is called a CT guided needle biopsy and it is often done by an x-ray specialist known as an interventional radiologist.  In a core needle biopsy , the doctor uses a larger needle to remove a small cylinder of tissue (about 1/16 inch in diameter and 1/2 inch long). Many experts feel that a core needle biopsy is better than FNA to diagnose a primary bone cancer.  Surgical bone biopsy  In this procedure, a surgeon needs to cut through the skin to reach the tumor  to remove a small piece of tissue. This is also called an incisional biopsy . If the entire tumor is removed (not just a small piece), it's called an excisional biopsy .  These biopsies are often done with the patient under general anesthesia (drugs are used to put you into a deep asleep). They can also be done using a nerve block, which numbs a large area. If this type of biopsy is needed, it's important that the surgeon who will later remove the cancer also be the one to do the biopsy.

[1] Additionally, the vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation . Ultraviolet's position on the electromagnetic spectrum is on the boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones , electric power transmission , and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization 's International Agency for Research on Cancer , but the link remains unproven. [2]  Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to increase the future incidence of cancer, particularly leukemia . The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial. The most widely accepted model posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with effective radiation dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert . [3] If the linear model is correct, then natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second.

Typical contributors to such risk include natural background radiation, medical procedures, occupational exposures, nuclear accidents, and many others. Some major contributors are discussed below.  Background [ edit ]  Radon is responsible for the worldwide majority of the mean public exposure to ionizing radiation . It is often the single largest contributor to an individual's background radiation dose, and is the most variable from location to location. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as attics, and basements. It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs. [4]  Epidemiological evidence shows a clear link between lung cancer and high concentrations of radon, with 21,000 radon-induced U.S. lung cancer deaths per year—second only to cigarette smoking—according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency . [5] Thus in geographic areas where radon is present in heightened concentrations, radon is considered a significant indoor air contaminant.  Residential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as passive smoking . [6] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco. [6]  Medical [ edit ]  In industrialized countries, Medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. Collective dose to Americans from medical imaging grew by a factor of six from 1990 to 2006, mostly due to growing use of 3D scans that impart much more dose per procedure than traditional radiographs . [7] CT scans alone, which account for half the medical imaging dose to the public, are estimated to be responsible for 0.4% of current cancers in the United States, and this may increase to as high as 1.5-2% with 2007 rates of CT usage; [8] however, this estimate is disputed. [9] Other nuclear medicine techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream, and radiotherapy treatments deliberately deliver lethal doses (on a cellular level) to tumors and surrounding tissues.  It has been estimated that CT scans performed in the US in 2007 alone will result in 29,000 new cancer cases in future years. [10] [11] This estimate is criticized by the American College of Radiology (ACR), which maintains that the life expectancy of CT scanned patients is not that of the general population and that the model of calculating cancer is based on total-body radiation exposure and thus faulty. [11]  Occupational [ edit ]  In accordance with ICRP recommendations, most regulators permit nuclear energy workers to receive up to 20 times more radiation dose than is permitted for the general public. [3] Higher doses are usually permitted when responding to an emergency. The majority of workers are routinely kept well within regulatory limits, while a few essential technicians will routinely approach their maximum each year. Accidental overexposures beyond regulatory limits happen globally several times a year. [12] Astronauts on long missions are at higher risk of cancer, see cancer and spaceflight .  Some occupations are exposed to radiation without being classed as nuclear energy workers. Airline crews receive occupational exposures from cosmic radiation because of reduced atmospheric shielding at altitude. Mine workers receive occupational exposures to radon, especially in uranium mines. Anyone working in a granite building, such as the US Capitol , is likely to receive a dose from natural uranium in the granite. [13]  Accidental [ edit ]     Chernobyl radiation map from 1996    Nuclear accidents can have dramatic consequences to their surroundings, but their global impact on cancer is less than that of natural and medical exposures.  The most severe nuclear accident is probably the Chernobyl disaster . In addition to conventional fatalities and acute radiation syndrome fatalities, nine children died of thyroid cancer , and it is estimated that there may be up to 4,000 excess cancer deaths among the approximately 600,000 most highly exposed people. [14] [15] Of the 100 million curies (4 exabecquerels ) of radioactive material, the short lived radioactive isotopes such as 131 I Chernobyl released were initially the most dangerous. Due to their short half-lives of 5 and 8 days they have now decayed, leaving the more long-lived 137 Cs (with a half-life of 30.07 years) and 90 Sr (with a half-life of 28.78 years) as main dangers.  In March 2011, an earthquake and tsunami caused damage that led to explosions and partial meltdowns at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. Significant release of radioactive material took place following hydrogen explosions at three reactors, as technicians tried to pump in seawater to keep the uranium fuel rods cool, and bled radioactive gas from the reactors in order to make room for the seawater. [16] Concerns about the large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in 20 km exclusion zone being set up around the power plant and people within the 20–30 km zone being advised to stay indoors. On March 24, 2011, Japanese officials announced that "radioactive iodine-131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 water-purification plants in Tokyo and five other prefectures". [17]  Other serious radiation accidents include the Kyshtym disaster (estimated 49 to 55 cancer deaths), [18] and the Windscale fire (an estimated 33 cancer deaths). [19] [20]  The Transit 5BN-3 SNAP 9A accident . On April 21, 1964, the satellite containing plutonium burnt up in the atmosphere. Dr. John Gofman claimed it increased the rate of lung cancer worldwide. He said "Although it is impossible to estimate [ dubious  – discuss ] the number of lung cancers induced by the accident, there is no question that the dispersal of so much Plutonium238 would add to the number of lung cancer diagnosed over many subsequent decades." [21] [22]  Mechanism [ edit ]  Cancer is a stochastic effect of radiation, meaning that the probability of occurrence increases with effective radiation dose , but the severity of the cancer is independent of dose. The speed at which cancer advances, the prognosis , the degree of pain, and every other feature of the disease are not functions of the radiation dose to which the person is exposed. This contrasts with the deterministic effects of acute radiation syndrome which increase in severity with dose above a threshold. Cancer starts with a single cell whose operation is disrupted. Normal cell operation is controlled by the chemical structure of DNA molecules, also called chromosomes .  When radiation deposits enough energy in organic tissue to cause ionization , this tends to break molecular bonds, and thus alter the molecular structure of the irradiated molecules. Less energetic radiation, such as visible light, only causes excitation , not ionization, which is usually dissipated as heat with relatively little chemical damage. Ultraviolet light is usually categorized as non-ionizing, but it is actually in an intermediate range that produces some ionization and chemical damage. Hence the carcinogenic mechanism of ultraviolet radiation is similar to that of ionizing radiation.  Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, penetrating radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. [note 1] Molecules broken by radiation can become highly reactive free radicals that cause further chemical damage. Some of this direct and indirect damage will eventually impact chromosomes and epigenetic factors that control the expression of genes. Cellular mechanisms will repair some of this damage, but some repairs will be incorrect and some chromosome abnormalities will turn out to be irreversible.  DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generally accepted to be the most biologically significant lesion by which ionizing radiation causes cancer. [6] In vitro experiments show that ionizing radiation cause DSBs at a rate of 35 DSBs per cell per Gray , [23] and removes a portion of the epigenetic markers of the DNA, [24] which regulate the gene expression. Most of the induced DSBs are repaired within 24h after exposure, however, 25% of the repaired strands are repaired incorrectly and about 20% of fibroblast cells that were exposed to 200mGy died within 4 days after exposure. [25] [26] [27] A portion of the population possess a flawed DNA repair mechanism, and thus suffer a greater insult due to exposure to radiation. [23]  Major damage normally results in the cell dying or being unable to reproduce. This effect is responsible for acute radiation syndrome, but these heavily damaged cells cannot become cancerous. Lighter damage may leave a stable, partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and eventually developing into cancer, especially if tumor suppressor genes are damaged. [6] [28] [29] [30] The latest research suggests that mutagenic events do not occur immediately after irradiation. Instead, surviving cells appear to have acquired a genomic instability which causes an increased rate of mutations in future generations. The cell will then progress through multiple stages of neoplastic transformation that may culminate into a tumor after years of incubation. The neoplastic transformation can be divided into three major independent stages: morphological changes to the cell, acquisition of cellular immortality (losing normal, life-limiting cell regulatory processes), and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor. [6]  In some cases, a small radiation dose reduces the impact of a subsequent, larger radiation dose. This has been termed an 'adaptive response' and is related to hypothetical mechanisms of hormesis . [31]  A latent period of decades may elapse between radiation exposure and the detection of cancer. Those cancers that may develop as a result of radiation exposure are indistinguishable from those that occur naturally or as a result of exposure to other carcinogens . Furthermore, National Cancer Institute literature indicates that chemical and physical hazards and lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet, significantly contribute to many of these same diseases. Evidence from uranium miners suggests that smoking may have a multiplicative, rather than additive, interaction with radiation. [6] Evaluations of radiation's contribution to cancer incidence can only be done through large epidemiological studies with thorough data about all other confounding risk factors.  Skin cancer [ edit ]  Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies. [32] Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB , as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers , which are the most common forms of cancer in the world. [32]  Skin cancer may occur following ionizing radiation exposure following a latent period averaging 20 to 40 years. [33] [34] A Chronic radiation keratosis is a precancerous keratotic skin lesion that may arise on the skin many years after exposure to ionizing radiation . [35] : 729 Various malignancies may develop, most frequency basal-cell carcinoma followed by squamous-cell carcinoma . [33] [36] [37] Elevated risk is confined to the site of radiation exposure. [38] Several studies have also suggested the possibility of a causal relationship between melanoma and ionizing radiation exposure. [39] The degree of carcinogenic risk arising from low levels of exposure is more contentious, but the available evidence points to an increased risk that is approximately proportional to the dose received. [40]  Radiologists and radiographers are among the earliest occupational groups exposed to radiation. It was the observation of the earliest radiologists that led to the recognition of radiation-induced skin cancer—the first solid cancer linked to radiation—in 1902. [41] While the incidence of skin cancer secondary to medical ionizing radiation was higher in the past, there is also some evidence that risks of certain cancers, notably skin cancer, may be increased among more recent medical radiation workers, and this may be related to specific or changing radiologic practices. [41] Available evidence indicates that the excess risk of skin cancer lasts for 45 years or more following irradiation. [42]  Epidemiology [ edit ]  Cancer is a stochastic effect of radiation, meaning that it only has a probability of occurrence, as opposed to deterministic effects which always happen over a certain dose threshold. The consensus of the nuclear industry, nuclear regulators, and governments, is that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with effective radiation dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert . [3] Individual studies, alternate models, and earlier versions of the industry consensus have produced other risk estimates scattered around this consensus model. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this. [43] [44] This model is widely accepted for external radiation, but its application to internal contamination is disputed. For example, the model fails to account for the low rates of cancer in early workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory who were exposed to plutonium dust, and the high rates of thyroid cancer in children following the Chernobyl accident , both of which were internal exposure events. The European Committee on Radiation Risk calls the ICRP model "fatally flawed" when it comes to internal exposure. [45]  Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced leukemias typically require 2–10 years to appear. [6] [46] Some people, such as those with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or retinoblastoma , are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure. [6] Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect. [6]  Radiation exposure can cause cancer in any living tissue, but high-dose whole-body external exposure is most closely associated with leukemia , [47] reflecting the high radiosensitivity of bone marrow. Internal exposures tend to cause cancer in the organs where the radioactive material concentrates, so that radon predominantly causes lung cancer , iodine-131 is most likely to cause thyroid cancer , etc.  Data sources [ edit ]     Increased Risk of Solid Cancer with Dose for A-bomb survivors    The associations between ionizing radiation exposure and the development of cancer are based primarily on the " LSS cohort " of Japanese atomic bomb survivors , the largest human population ever exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation. However this cohort was also exposed to high heat, both from the initial nuclear flash of infrared light and following the blast due their exposure to the firestorm and general fires that developed in both cities respectively, so the survivors also underwent Hyperthermia therapy to various degrees. Hyperthermia, or heat exposure following irradiation is well known in the field of radiation therapy to markedly increase the severity of free-radical insults to cells following irradiation. Presently however no attempts have been made to cater for this confounding factor, it is not included or corrected for in the dose-response curves for this group.  Additional data has been collected from recipients of selected medical procedures and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster . There is a clear link (see the UNSCEAR 2000 Report, Volume 2: Effects ) between the Chernobyl accident and the unusually large number, approximately 1,800, of thyroid cancers reported in contaminated areas, mostly in children.  For low levels of radiation, the biological effects are so small they may not be detected in epidemiological studies. Although radiation may cause cancer at high doses and high dose rates, public health data regarding lower levels of exposure, below about 10 mSv (1,000 mrem), are harder to interpret. To assess the health impacts of lower radiation doses , researchers rely on models of the process by which radiation causes cancer; several models that predict differing levels of risk have emerged.  Studies of occupational workers exposed to chronic low levels of radiation, above normal background, have provided mixed evidence regarding cancer and transgenerational effects. Cancer results, although uncertain, are consistent with estimates of risk based on atomic bomb survivors and suggest that these workers do face a small increase in the probability of developing leukemia and other cancers. One of the most recent and extensive studies of workers was published by Cardis, et al. in 2005 . [48] There is evidence that low level, brief radiation exposures are not harmful. [49]  Modelling [ edit ]     Alternative assumptions for the extrapolation of the cancer risk vs. radiation dose to low-dose levels, given a known risk at a high dose: supra-linearity (A), linear (B), linear-quadratic (C) and hormesis (D).    The linear dose-response model suggests that any increase in dose, no matter how small, results in an incremental increase in risk. The linear no-threshold model (LNT) hypothesis is accepted by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and regulators around the world. [50] According to this model, about 1% of the global population develop cancer as a result of natural background radiation at some point in their lifetime. For comparison, 13% of deaths in 2008 are attributed to cancer, so background radiation could plausibly be a small contributor. [51]  Many parties have criticized the ICRP's adoption of the linear no-threshold model for exaggerating the effects of low radiation doses. The most frequently cited alternatives are the “linear quadratic” model and the “hormesis” model. The linear quadratic model is widely viewed in radiotherapy as the best model of cellular survival, [52] and it is the best fit to leukemia data from the LSS cohort. [6]    Linear no-threshold  F(D)=α⋅D    Linear quadratic  F(D)=α⋅D+β⋅D 2    Hormesis  F(D)=α⋅[D−β]    In all three cases, the values of alpha and beta must be determined by regression from human exposure data. Laboratory experiments on animals and tissue samples is of limited value. Most of the high quality human data available is from high dose individuals, above 0.1 Sv, so any use of the models at low doses is an extrapolation that might be under-conservative or over-conservative. There is not enough human data available to settle decisively which of these model might be most accurate at low doses. The consensus has been to assume linear no-threshold because it the simplest and most conservative of the three.  Radiation hormesis is the conjecture that a low level of ionizing radiation (i.e., near the level of Earth's natural background radiation) helps "immunize" cells against DNA damage from other causes (such as free radicals or larger doses of ionizing radiation), and decreases the risk of cancer. The theory proposes that such low levels activate the body's DNA repair mechanisms, causing higher levels of cellular DNA-repair proteins to be present in the body, improving the body's ability to repair DNA damage. This assertion is very difficult to prove in humans (using, for example, statistical cancer studies) because the effects of very low ionizing radiation levels are too small to be statistically measured amid the "noise" of normal cancer rates.  The idea of radiation hormesis is considered unproven by regulatory bodies. If the hormesis model turns out to be accurate, it is conceivable that current regulations based on the LNT model will prevent or limit the hormetic effect, and thus have a negative impact on health. [53]  Other non-linear effects have been observed, particularly for internal doses . For example, iodine-131 is notable in that high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous than low doses, since they tend to kill thyroid tissues that would otherwise become cancerous as a result of the radiation. Most studies of very-high-dose I-131 for treatment of Graves disease have failed to find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is linear increase in thyroid cancer risk with I-131 absorption at moderate doses. [54]  Public safety [ edit ]  Low-dose exposures, such as living near a nuclear power plant or a coal-fired power plant , which has higher emissions than nuclear plants, are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development, barring accidents. [6] Greater concerns include radon in buildings and overuse of medical imaging.  The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends limiting artificial irradiation of the public to an average of 1 mSv (0.001 Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures. [3] For comparison, radiation levels inside the US capitol building are 0.85 mSv/yr, close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the granite structure. [13] According to the ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk. (20 yr X 0.85 mSv/yr X 0.001 Sv/mSv X 5.5%/Sv = ~0.1%) That "existing risk" is much higher; an average American would have a one in ten chance of getting cancer during this same 20-year period, even without any exposure to artificial radiation.  Internal contamination due to ingestion, inhalation, injection, or absorption is a particular concern because the radioactive material may stay in the body for an extended period of time, "committing" the subject to accumulating dose long after the initial exposure has ceased, albeit at low dose rates. Over a hundred people, including Eben Byers and the radium girls , have received committed doses in excess of 10 Gy and went on to die of cancer or natural causes, whereas the same amount of acute external dose would invariably cause an earlier death by acute radiation syndrome . [55]  Internal exposure of the public is controlled by regulatory limits on the radioactive content of food and water. These limits are typically expressed in becquerel /kilogram, with different limits set for each contaminant.  History [ edit ]  Although radiation was discovered in late 19th century, the dangers of radioactivity and of radiation were not immediately recognized. Acute effects of radiation were first observed in the use of X-rays when Wilhelm Röntgen intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he attributed them to ozone rather than to X-rays. His injuries healed later.  The genetic effects of radiation, including the effects on cancer risk, were recognized much later. In 1927 Hermann Joseph Muller published research showing genetic effects, [56] and in 1946 was awarded the Nobel prize for his findings. Radiation was soon linked to bone cancer in the radium dial painters , but this was not confirmed until large-scale animal studies after World War II. The risk was then quantified through long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors .  Before the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicians and corporations had begun marketing radioactive substances as patent medicine and radioactive quackery . Examples were radium enema treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. Marie Curie spoke out against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later died of acute radiation syndrome , not cancer. Eben Byers , a famous American socialite, died of multiple cancers in 1932 after consuming large quantities of radium over several years; his death drew public attention to dangers of radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death in enthusiasts, radium-containing medical products had nearly vanished from the market.  In the United States, the experience of the so-called Radium Girls , where thousands of radium-dial painters contracted oral cancers, popularized the warnings of occupational health associated with radiation hazards. Robley D. Evans , at MIT, developed the first standard for permissible body burden of radium, a key step in the establishment of nuclear medicine as a field of study. With the development of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons in the 1940s, heightened scientific attention was given to the study of all manner of radiation effects.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In the case of internal contamination with alpha emitters , the distribution may not be so random. Transuranic elements are believed to have a chemical affinity for DNA, and any radioactive element could be part of a chemical compound that targets certain molecules.

Sun and Other Types of Radiation  X-rays, Gamma Rays, and Cancer Risk             Do x-rays and gamma rays cause cancer?    Yes. X-rays and gamma rays are known human carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). The evidence for this comes from many different sources, including studies of atomic bomb survivors in Japan, people exposed during the Chernobyl nuclear accident, people treated with high doses of radiation for cancer and other conditions, and people exposed to high levels of radiation at work, such as uranium miners.  Most studies on radiation and cancer risk have looked at people exposed to high doses of radiation in the settings above. It is harder to measure the much smaller increase in cancer risk that might come from much lower levels of radiation exposure. Most studies have not been able to detect an increased risk of cancer among people exposed to low levels of radiation. For example, people living at high altitudes, who are exposed to more natural background radiation from cosmic rays than people living at sea level, do not have noticeably higher cancer rates.  Still, most scientists and regulatory agencies agree that even small doses of gamma and x-radiation increase cancer risk, although by a very small amount. In general, the risk of cancer from radiation exposure increases as the dose of radiation increases. Likewise, the lower the exposure is, the smaller the increase in risk. But there is no threshold below which this kind of radiation is thought to be totally safe.  What do the studies show?  Atomic bomb survivors  Much of what we know about cancer risks from radiation is based on studies of the survivors of the atomic bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. These people had higher risks of some, but not all cancers. Studies have found an increased risk of the following cancers (from higher to lower risk):   Most types of leukemia (although not chronic lymphocytic leukemia)  Multiple myeloma  Thyroid cancer  Bladder cancer  Breast cancer  Lung cancer  Ovarian cancer  Colon cancer (but not rectal cancer)  Esophageal cancer  Stomach cancer  Liver cancer  Lymphoma  Skin cancer (besides melanoma)   For most of these cancers, the risk was highest for those exposed as children, and was lower as the age at exposure increased. Those exposed while still in the womb (in utero) had lower risks than those exposed during childhood.  Higher radiation exposure was linked to higher risk of cancer, but even low amounts of radiation were linked to an increased risk of getting and dying from cancer. There was no clear cut-off for safe radiation exposure.  These cancers took years to develop, but some cancers appeared sooner than others. Deaths from leukemia went up about 2 to 3 years after exposure, with the number of cases peaking after about 10 years and going down after that. Solid tumors took longer to develop. For example, excess deaths from lung cancer began to be seen about 20 years after exposure.  Chernobyl accident  Children and adolescents living near the Chernobyl plant at the time of the accident had an increased risk of thyroid cancer linked to exposure to radioactive iodine. The risk was higher in areas that were iodine deficient. This increased risk was not seen in adults living in the area.  Workers employed in cleanup operations from 1986-1990 had an increased risk of leukemia (all types). These individuals had higher and more prolonged radiation exposures that the population residing around the plant.  Nuclear weapons testing  Studies suggest that some people who were children during the period of above ground nuclear testing in the US may develop thyroid cancer as a result of exposure to radioactive iodine in milk.  Radiation therapy  To treat benign conditions  Although radiation therapy is now mostly used to treat cancer, it was used to treat a number of benign (non-cancerous) diseases before the risks were clearer. Studies of these patients have helped us learn about how radiation affects cancer risk.  Peptic ulcer disease: A large study of people who were treated with high doses of radiation (an average of 15 Gy or 15,000 mSv) for the treatment of peptic ulcers found a higher risk of cancer of the stomach and pancreas.  Ringworm of the scalp: Studies of people who were treated with radiation to treat a fungal infection of the scalp (called scalp  ringworm or tinea capitis ) have found an increased risk of basal cell skin cancers. The risk was lower in people who were older when treated. This increased risk was seen only in white patients, and the cancers occurred more often in sun-exposed skin of the head and neck (as opposed to the scalp), which implies that ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a role in these cancers as well.  Ankylosing spondylitis: Studies have looked at the cancer risks of patients with the autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis who were injected with a form of radium.  In one study, patients who received a high dose (average bone dose of 31,000 mGy) had an increased risk of bone sarcoma. The risks of some other cancers, such as breast, liver, kidney, bladder, and other sarcomas, may also have been increased. About one-quarter of the patients in this study were younger than 20 years of age when they were treated with radiation.  In another study, patients treated with a lower dose of radium (average bone dose of 6,000 mGy) had a higher risk of leukemia, but not of any other cancers. Most of the patients in this study were adults at the time of treatment.  Other studies: Treatment of the head and neck area with radiation for benign conditions has also been linked to cancers of the salivary gland and brain and spinal cord in adults in some studies. Children treated with radiation to this area also have an increased risk of thyroid cancer.  To treat cancer  Studies have linked radiation therapy to treat cancer with an increased risk of leukemia, thyroid cancer, early-onset breast cancer, and some other cancers. The risk of cancer depends on a number of factors, include the dose of radiation, the part of the body being treated, the age of the person getting it (younger people are generally at greater risk), and the use of other treatments such as chemotherapy.  For example, people who get pelvic radiation therapy would not be expected to have higher rates of cancers in the head and neck because these areas weren’t exposed to the radiation from the treatment. Other factors might also play a role in how likely a person exposed to radiation is to develop cancer. For example, some genetic conditions can mean that a person’s cells are more vulnerable to radiation damage, which might in turn raise their risk more than in someone without these gene changes.  If cancer does develop after radiation therapy, it does not happen right away. For leukemias, most cases develop within 5 to 9 years after exposure. In contrast, other cancers often take much longer to develop. Most of these cancers are not seen for at least 10 years after radiation therapy, and some are diagnosed even more than 15 years later.  When considering radiation exposure from radiation therapy treatment for cancer, the benefits generally outweigh the risks. Overall, radiation therapy alone does not appear to be a very strong cause of second cancers. This is probably due to the fact that doctors try to focus the radiation on the cancer cells as much as possible, which means few normal cells are exposed to radiation. However, some combinations of radiation therapy and chemotherapy are more risky than others. Doctors do their best to ensure the treatment that is given destroys the cancer while limiting the risk that a secondary cancer will develop later on.  For more information, see Second Cancers in Adults .  Imaging tests  Some studies have estimated the risk of radiation exposure from imaging tests based on the risks from similar amounts of radiation exposure in the studies of the atomic bomb survivors. Based on these studies, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that exposure to 10 mSv from an imaging test would be expected to increase the risk of death from cancer by about 1 chance in 2000.  It can be difficult to study cancer risks from imaging studies that use radiation. In order to see small risks (such as 1 in 2000), a study would have to look at 10s or 100s of thousands of people. Information about other exposures that could be cancer risk factors would be needed, to see if it was likely that the cancer came from the radiation exposure. Since cancers from radiation take years to develop, the study would need to follow the patients for many years.  Often, scientists use questionnaire studies to look for possible causes of cancer. These studies compare exposures among people who have a certain cancer to those who don’t. They may instead compare people who had a certain exposure (like to radiation) to those who didn’t. However, this is difficult to do for diagnostic radiation exposure since many people cannot accurately recall information about things that happened many years before (such as in childhood) and information about all the imaging tests that were done is often not available. There is also a concern that people with cancer tend to over report exposures that they worry may have caused their cancers.  Studies that have found increased risk of cancer after imaging tests that use x-rays often involve people who had multiple tests or high dose procedures, including:  Fluoroscopy  Studies of women who had been imaged many times with fluoroscopy as a teenager or young woman during treatment for tuberculosis have found an increased risk of breast cancer years later.  Spine x-rays  Teenagers and young women who had many x-rays of the spine to monitor scoliosis have been found to have an increased risk of breast cancer later on.  Dental x-rays  A study compared a group of people with meningioma (a brain tumor that is most often benign) with a group without the tumors. It found that the people who had the tumors were more likely to have had a type of dental x-ray called a bite-wing, and to have had bite-wing or Panorex x-rays every year.  CT scans  A study in England of exposure to radiation from CT scans found that children who received a dose of at least 30 mGy (the same as 30 mSv) to the bone marrow had 3 times the risk of leukemia compared to those who received a dose of 5 mGy or less. For brain tumors, a dose of 50 mGy or more to the brain was linked to more than 3 times the risk.  A study in Australia of exposure to radiation from CT scans in childhood and adolescence found that after an average of about 9 ½ years, those who had a CT scan had a 24% higher risk of cancer overall. The risk of cancer was higher the more CT scans the person had, and it was also higher the younger the person was at the time of the CT scan. Still, the overall risk of cancer was still low.  A study from Taiwan found that children and teens who had a CT scan of the head did not have a higher risk of brain cancer or leukemia, but were more likely to be diagnosed with a benign brain tumor.  What do expert agencies say?  Several agencies (national and international) study different substances in the environment to determine if they can cause cancer. (A substance that causes cancer or helps cancer grow is called a carcinogen .) The American Cancer Society looks to these organizations to evaluate the risks based on evidence from laboratory, animal, and human research studies.  Based on animal and human evidence, several expert agencies have evaluated the cancer-causing nature of x-rays and gamma rays.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). Its major goal is to identify causes of cancer. Based on the data available, IARC classifies x- and gamma radiation as a “known human carcinogen.”  The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is formed from parts of several different US government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NTP has classified x- and gamma radiation as “known to be a human carcinogen.”  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits for exposure to x-rays and gamma rays in part because it recognizes that this form of radiation can cause cancer.

First, though, remember that without radiation exposure , the odds of getting cancer are 1 in 2.4 (or 42 percent). This means that of 100 average people I know, including me, 42 of us may get cancer at some time in our lives. In addition, if I go to the doctor and have a pelvic CT scan ( dose <= 1 rem ), my cancer odds stay 1 in 2.4 (or 42 percent). If I have 10 CT scans, my cancer odds are now 1 in 2.3 (or 43.7 percent). If I live next to the perimeter fence around a nuclear power plant for 40 years, my cancer odds are 1 in 2.4, the same as baseline with no extra radiation exposure .  With that information we now have a better understanding of the approximate risks of radiation doses. We can see that radiation doses less than 10 rem are unlikely to cause harmful effects and only slightly increase our chances of getting cancer. Whether to be concerned or not is still a personal decision. Taking steps to keep our exposure to any potentially harmful agent reasonably small is important. It is a personal responsibility for ourselves and our families.  We must, however, try to make informed decisions based on the real and not the perceived risks in our everyday lives. When we do that, we can lower or eliminate the higher risks over which we have control and not agonize over lowering risks that are already low. Often, we believe that if radiation is present there is a high risk . As can be seen from the charts and the information in this section, we know this is not true. To compare the chances of getting cancer from radiation exposure to other more common chances of diseases or accidents, see our Probability Table .  X Rays & Cancer  Let’s look at the risk of cancer, then, from some basic x rays . Here are the radiation sources, the approximate dose of radiation you get from them, and how much your chances of getting cancer increases in your lifetime as a result of that radiation dose . Remember, with no extra radiation dose , your odds of getting cancer in your lifetime are about 10 out of 24 (or 1 in 2.4) or 42 percent.      Radiation Source  Effective Dose  Additional Chances of Getting Cancer‡*     bitewing dental film  annual dose living at nuclear power plant perimeter  skull x ray  chest x ray    Less than (<) or equal to (=) 0.01 rem    <=1 in 60,000      spine x ray  abdominal x ray  pelvis x ray  hip x ray  mammogram    <=0.1 rem    <=1 in 6,000      kidney series of x rays  most barium-related x rays  head CT +   any spine x-ray series  one year’s worth of natural background radiation  most nuclear medicine liver, kidney, bone, brain, or lung scans    <=0.5 rem    <=1 in 1,200      barium enema  chest, abdomen, or pelvic CT +     <=1.0 rem    <=1 in 600      cardiac catheterization  coronary angiogram  other heart x-ray studies  most nuclear medicine heart scans    <=5.0 rem    <=1 in 120        ‡The “odds” numbers in this column are estimated numbers of increased cancers; the real number in each case may be zero up to the number cited. For instance, the odds of 1 in 120 really are “zero up to 1” in 120.  *Numbers from the National Radiation Protection Board (now the United Kingdom Health Protection Authority)   + CT = computerized tomography; a specialized x-ray exam.       So, you can see that even with many types of radiation exposures and medical exams, the ordinary everyday odds of getting a cancer (1 in 2.4) are much higher than the added chances of getting cancer from radiation exposure .     ©2007 RadiationAnswers.org .

Ionising radiation is a type of radiation called ‘high energy’. The high energy that ionising radiation has means it can affect our cells, including mutating DNA which can lead to cancer. This is different to non-ionising radiation , which has less energy.  There are different types of ionising radiation, including gamma rays and x-rays.  It’s important to remember that we are exposed to radiation from natural sources every day. Radon gas from the earth’s crust contributes the largest amount of natural radiation to most people living in the UK. Cosmic rays from the sun, stars and outer space, natural radiation from the food we eat, the water we drink and the ground we walk on, also contribute to our natural exposure every day. Watch our video to find out more.  To help avoid the potential health effects of ionising radiation, any man-made exposures are tightly regulated.  Can X-rays and medical imaging increase the risk of cancer?  Medical x-rays and other types of imaging are very important to help diagnose different illnesses, including cancer. Some types of imaging, including X-rays and CT scans (Computed Tomography) use ionising radiation. The health risks from the radiation the imaging equipment uses are generally very low, and usually outweighed by the benefits of getting the right diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Nevertheless, there is evidence that exposure to diagnostic x-rays slightly increases the risk of getting diagnosed with cancer many years or decades later. About 6 in 1,000 cancers in the UK are caused by diagnostic radiation.  The dose received from medical imaging is usually less than what we'd be exposed to naturally over a few days or years (depending on the type of imaging technique used and the part of the body being scanned). Although medical x-rays add some extra radiation on top of natural radiation exposure, they also bring great benefits to patients. But unnecessary x-rays or medical scans should be avoided.  Common types of medical x-rays  There are different types of medical imaging tests using x-rays that you may come across:  Radiography to look at broken bones or your teeth and chest  Mammography to screen for breast cancers  Computed tomography (CT) to detect different diseases, including some cancers  Fluoroscopy, such as barium x-rays, to look at your digestive system  How much radiation does an x-ray give out?  These tests all involve different amounts of radiation. The level of risk from the radiation you receive will depend on:  The type of scan you have – for example a chest x-ray poses a lower risk than a CT scan of the chest  The area of the body – for example dental x-rays pose a lower risk than chest x-rays  Age – young patients are at more risk. Unborn babies are also at higher risk so you should tell your doctor if you’re pregnant  Gender – women have a slightly higher lifetime risk of developing radiation-induced cancers than men  In the UK, the Public Health England monitors the amount of radiation we receive from x-rays and makes sure they are as safe as possible. You can find out more about radiation from medical x-rays on the Public Health England website .  Are there ways to limit radiation if I need an x-ray?  When possible, your doctors will recommend other types of imaging that don’t use radiation, for example using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan). But in some cases an x-ray is the best way to do the job.  If you are concerned about having a large number of x-rays, you should talk to your doctor about it. You should also tell your doctor of previous x-rays you may have had. They may be useful for diagnosing, managing or treating your current condition. And they may mean that you do not need to have more x-ray tests.  What are the risks of commercially available body scans?  Some commercial companies offer ‘full body’ CT and PET (positron emission tomography) scans to the public. These are available to people who are willing to pay privately, even if the scans aren’t recommended by their doctor and aren’t medically necessary. These scans have risks, and when they are not needed or done on people with no medical symptoms, they are likely to do more harm than good.  A ‘full body’ PET CT scan (in which a PET and a CT scan are done at the same time) uses more than 1000 times the amount of radiation of a single chest x-ray. This may be necessary for people with a genuine medical need. But for healthy people without symptoms, the risks generally outweigh the benefits. And while scans are helpful for finding out what is causing a symptom, in people with no symptoms these scans can flag up harmless abnormalities, or conditions which would never have caused any problems. So they may lead to unnecessary tests and treatment.  Can air travel increase the risk of cancer?  Travelling by plane is a safe way to travel and is unlikely to affect your risk of cancer.  Does air travel expose people to radiation?  The Earth receives a lot of ‘cosmic radiation’ from space, but our atmosphere shields us from most of this. The atmosphere thins the higher you get, so someone flying in a plane would receive more cosmic radiation than someone on the ground.  A passenger would get a very small extra amount of radiation, but the low level of radiation that they would experience is very unlikely to seriously affect their cancer risk, even if they were a frequent flyer.  Do airport body scanners use radiation?  Body scanners are used in many airports across the UK and abroad. There are two types of scanner in the UK. One type uses millimetre radio waves that can “see” through clothing. The other type uses a very low dose of ionising radiation. Neither type has been shown to pose a risk to people’s health.  The first type of scanner uses radio waves, which are a form of non-ionising radiation that does not cause health effects at the low doses given off by airport scanners. Read more about non-ionising radiation, such as that used in mobile phones, wifi and power lines here.  The second type uses ionising radiation, which in high doses can be harmful. But the levels used in airport scanners are about 100,000 times lower than what an average UK person would naturally be exposed to each year. This dose is so low that it makes no noticeable difference to a person’s risk of cancer.  Can living near a nuclear power plant increase the risk of cancer?  So far, the evidence shows that it is unlikely that people who live near nuclear power plants are at a higher risk of cancer.  What does the evidence say?  Most of the evidence to date comes from small studies looking at childhood cancers, particularly childhood leukaemia. Larger studies on this topic are difficult to do, as there aren’t that many children living near nuclear power plants who develop leukaemia or other cancers.  Recently, a group of researchers combined the evidence from several small European studies, showing that overall there is no increased risk for those aged under 15 years living within 25km of a nuclear power plant.  But for children under 5 who live closer (within 5km) to a nuclear power plant the evidence is more mixed. Some studies found a small but increased risk of leukaemia, while others did not. This may have to do with different study designs, differences between the countries in which the studies were done, or other factors that could influence the risk of leukaemia (such as infections).  Based on the evidence available at the moment, the government’s Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) has concluded that “there is no evidence to support the view that there is an increased risk of childhood leukaemia and other cancers in the vicinity of nuclear power plants in Great Britain”.  Nuclear disasters and cancer  Nuclear disasters are events that may expose populations to higher levels of ionising radiation. Examples include the nuclear power plant accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima , as well as the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Studies of survivors of these events have found that the risk of developing thyroid cancer is higher in these populations, particularly in those who were aged less than 18 at the time of the disasters. But because cancers usually take a number of years to develop after radiation exposure, it’s difficult to say with certainty which cancers were caused by the extra radiation. And there is also evidence that – at least in the case of Fukushima – increased screening efforts can lead to the detection of more thyroid cancers, including cancers that weren’t caused by radiation and that would never have caused harm in someone's lifetime – this is called overdiagnosis.  There is no evidence that the risk of other cancer types rises considerably by exposure to ionising radiation from nuclear accidents in people in the general population – mostly because the doses received are too low to have major effects. But there is some evidence from Chernobyl that clean-up workers, who were exposed to very high levels of radiation, have a higher risk of some types of cancer, particularly leukaemia. For survivors of the nuclear bombings, risk of some types of cancer is also increased.  Studies looking at the long-term effects of nuclear disasters, particularly the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011, are still ongoing.

Cancer Do X-Rays Increase My Risk of Cancer? The risks are real—but usually outweighed by the benefits. SHARE TWEET Markham Heid Jan 18 2018, 5:00pm Caspar Benson/Getty Images One irony of modern medicine is that, the more effective a treatment or technology becomes, the more we take it for granted and focus on its downsides—real or imagined.  The most glaring example is vaccines, which have saved millions of lives, but which some people— based on zero credible science —continue to blame for autism and other developmental issues in children. The cancer concerns associated with X-ray radiation aren’t nearly so overblown. But before digging into those concerns, it’s important to recognize how much CT scans and other forms of X-ray imaging have revolutionized health care.  Search for lists of the medical innovations that most improved patient care during the last 50 years, and computer tomography—the X-ray technology used to perform CT scans—will always land at or near the top of the list. “It changed the practice of medicine,” says Sanjay Saini, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School. Whether isolating a tumor and mapping its growth, or revealing diseases of the bowels or internal organs, a CT scan is much more likely to save your life than imperil it.  That said, there are legitimate cancer risks associated with CT imaging. But those risks are “very small,” says David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Medical Center.  According to a 2007 study Brenner published in the New England Journal of Medicine , if you’re under 30 at the time of a CT, your risk for cancer may jump anywhere from .01% to .14%. (If you’re older, your cancer risks from CT are lower.) But Brenner says that, thanks to advances in CT technology, his 2007 risk estimates are probably too high. “I would characterize our best estimates of the risks of cancer associated with a CT today in the range of one chance in 2,000 to one chance in 20,000,” he says.  He adds that the cancer risks associated with CT are “not on the same scale” as the risks associated with smoking or other well-established carcinogens.  Researchers single out CT because this form of imaging exposes you to levels of radiation “orders of magnitude” higher than traditional X-ray, Saini explains. While old-school X-rays are designed to grab a single snapshot of your insides, CT scans work by taking a series of 2D images from many different angles, which are then assembled to form a 3D image. “Five hundred chest X-rays are equal to one CT scan,” Saini says. (When it comes to the dentist office X-rays of your teeth—the ones where they drape you with that discomfiting lead vest—the radiation exposures are in the realm of chest X-rays, he adds.) Saini points out that the whole planet is mildly radioactive, and you’re exposed to more of that radiation when you spend time at high altitudes. “If you take an airplane from Boston to the West Coast, the amount of [radiation] exposure is about what you’d get from a chest X-ray,” he says. There’s no evidence that pilots or flight attendants experience elevated cancer rates due to increased radiation exposure. So as far as basic X-rays are concerned, your cancer risks are minute—if not zero, he says.  Also important to note: Not all medical imaging exposes you to radiation. MRI, for example, uses magnetic resonance—not electromagnetic radiation—to peer inside your body. MRIs are not associated with any cancer risks whatsoever, Brenner explains.  So should you freak out about CT scans? Both Brenner and Siani say radiation exposure and cancer have a linear relationship—meaning the more you’re exposed, the greater your risks. Some researchers dispute this . But a large-scale study from Australia found having a single CT scan before age 20 raises a person’s relative lifetime risk for cancer by 24%. The higher the radiation exposure and the younger the person, the greater the risk.  Yes, that 24 percent figure is frightening. But the actual number of study participants who developed cancer was quite small. Out of the more than 680,000 young people who had a CT scan, the Aussie researchers turned up just 3,150 total cancer cases among them.  Taking into account the recent advancements in CT technology—advancements that allow for lower doses of radiation—the odds that you’ll develop cancer from a CT scan are extremely low, especially if you’re an adult, Brenner says. Still, he worries about the overuse of CT. “I think there are many situations where people are prescribed CT when not needing it,” he says. “The percentage [of needless CT scans] may be as high as 20 or 25 percent, and given that there are 80 million CT scans performed every year, that’s a big number.”  He says young people who undergo multiple CT scans are most at risk. “People who get kidney stones tend to get them again and again,” he says. The first time a patient has a kidney stone, a CT is needed to rule out other health issues. “But the third and fourth and fifth time these patients have a kidney stone, they don’t need a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis,” he says.  Saini says young people and pregnant women also need to be cautious. “We know that cells replicating are more likely to be injured [by radiation exposure] than those that are not,” he says. This cell injury can lead to the formation of tumors or cancer cells. And because cell reproduction is more common in fetuses and young people, CT scans should not be performed on these patient populations if it can be helped, he says.  So what are you supposed to do if your doctor recommends a CT scan? “There’s no reason you shouldn’t ask your physician if CT is medically justified,” Brenner says. He mentions the appropriateness criteria established by the American College of Radiologists, which are basically a set of evidence-based rules for when to perform a CT, and when it’s not necessary. If your doctor’s justification doesn’t convince you, it may be worth seeking a second opinion before undergoing the CT (assuming it’s not an emergency situation).  “The bottom line is, when you need a CT scan, you absolutely should have one because the benefits are huge and the risks are small,” Brenner says. “But if you don’t need a CT scan, the benefits are zero, and so even small risks outweigh the benefits.” Read This Next: Exactly What Happens When Your Body Is Exposed to Radiation SHARE TWEET Tagged: DOCTORS radiation x-ray body guide to healthcare Welcome to Club Tonic.

Radiation from the Environment  Background radiation  Background radiation refers to radiation that naturally occurs in our environment and does not come from any manufactured devices.  Radiation is emitted from the earth, sun, our galaxy, and other galaxies.  Even the human body naturally contains some radioactive elements. 8  People who receive few or no high-dose radiation medical tests usually get more exposure to radiation from the natural environment than from any manufactured device. 9  This is because we are constantly exposed to a very low dose radiation for our whole lives, while devices such as x-ray tests expose you to radiation for a very short period of time.  On the other hand, one CT scan can be equal to several years of background radiation exposures, so many people receive much higher doses of radiation from medical devices than they do from the natural environment.  The risk of developing cancer from a lifetime exposure of background radiation is about 1 in 100, or 1% of the population. 10 It is impossible to avoid all background radiation, but the best ways to limit unnecessary exposure to radiation from the environment is to prevent your exposure to radon and repeated unprotected sun exposure.  Radon  Radon is a color less, odorless gas that comes from decaying rocks and soil.  For the average person, radon accounts for over half their annual exposure to radiation.  Radon comes up from the ground and gets trapped in houses and buildings.  Exposure to a small amount of radon inside is normal, but high levels can cause lung cancer.  Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer (smoking is the leading cause), and approximately 1 in every 15 houses have too much radon.  The only way to know if you have a safe level of radon in your house is to get it tested. 11  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation  Cosmic and terrestrial radiation is radiation that comes from the galaxy and from the earth.  It makes up about 8% of our average yearly exposure to radiation. 12 Cosmic radiation includes ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun that cause tans and sunburns.  UV rays can also damage the DNA in our skin cells and lead to skin cancer. 13 Although we cannot avoid UV rays all the time, limiting exposure to direct sun light can reduce your risk of skin cancer.  Tanning beds are also a common source of UV radiation and are just as dangerous as radiation from the sun.  For more information on tanning beds, please read: Tanning Beds: Safe Alternative to Sun?  Being at higher altitudes, such as flying on a plane or living in a “mile high” location, will exposure you to higher levels of cosmic radiation than being at sea level.  While there is technically no “safe” dose of ionizing radiation, the chances of getting cancer from frequent plane trips is very slim.  Studies of airline crew members have not found a significant increase in risk of cancer after many years of working on airplane. 14  In addition, living in Denver or other high altitude locations that receive higher doses of cosmic radiation has not been shown to increase the risk of cancer. 15   How to Reduce Radiation Exposure from the Environment  Radon :  Test the level of radon inside your house to make sure it is not too high.  You can hire a professional to do this or you can purchase a “do-it-yourself” radon testing kit.  It generally takes only a few minutes and is easy to do.  If there is too high a level of radon in your house, people usually install an active soil depressurization (ASD) system, which is basically a ventilation system. 2  UV Radiation: Some of the best ways to reduce your exposure to harmful UV rays are to:   Wear sunscreen (at least SPF 15) year-round in all areas of your body that are exposed to the sun. (However, it is good to get vitamin D from the sun for 15 minutes each day.)  Stay in the shade, especially when the sun is at it’s strongest (between 10am and 4pm)  Wear protective clothing, such as broad-brimmed hats and tightly-woven clothes that cover your hands and legs.    Medical Devices that Use Radiation  X-rays  X-rays use ionizing radiation and are used for many types of diagnostic tests such as CT scans, mammograms, fluoroscopy, and simple x-rays.  These tests allow your doctor to see potential problems inside your body and choose an appropriate treatment.  They can help doctors make life-saving decisions, but some doctors are performing unnecessary scans or are using doses of radiation that are too high. 16 Since x-rays use ionizing radiation, they can cause damage to our cells and DNA. X-ray tests can lead to cancer, but several common tests (such as mammograms and bone x-rays) use very low doses that have not been shown to cause a significant increased risk of cancer when administered properly.  Over the past few decades, the average level of radiation that Americans are exposed to has increased rapidly due to increased use of medical diagnostic tests such as x-rays (including dental x-rays and mammograms) and CT scans and cancer treatments.  Diagnostic tests and treatments can help improve patients’ quality and length of life, but there are also risks.  Usually, the benefit of receiving one of these tests outweighs the risk, but patients and doctors need to be wary of performing unnecessary tests, particularly if the test uses high doses of radiation.  Not all imaging tests use radiation that has been linked to cancer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) and ultrasounds do not use x-rays.  Instead, they use non-ionizing radiation and have not been found to increase the risk of cancer or other health problems. 17  MRIs and Ultrasounds are a safer alternative to diagnostics tests that use x-rays or other ionizing radiation.  Children, young adults, and fetuses of pregnant women should be particularly careful about getting any x-ray tests.  Children, young adults, and fetuses are more sensitive to radiation, and their young age also allows a longer period of time for cancer to develop. 18 , 19 , 20  Pregnant women should avoid any x-ray exposure, particularly when they are less than 20 weeks pregnant, since radiation exposure in the womb can lead to mental retardation, growth retardation, leukemia, and other cancers later in life. 21 If it is necessary for a pregnant women to be x-rayed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states a single x-ray test does not harm the fetus, but a protective lead apron should be used to cover the abdomen. 22 However, high-dose, multiple-dose, or x-rays of the pelvic region should be avoided for pregnant women, whenever possible.  Many people get simple x-ray tests, such as an arm, leg, chest, or dental x-ray that look for broken bones or other problems.  Simple x-ray tests use very low doses of radiation, 23   and studies have not found an increase risk of cancer among humans who have received a very low dose of radiation. 24 Although the dose of radiation used to x-ray different parts of the body will vary, most simple x-rays use less radiation than other types of x-ray scans (such as a mammogram or CT scan).  Mammograms  Mammograms are an x-ray test that is used to detect breast cancer.  This test uses a higher dose of radiation than a simple x-ray, but less than a CT scan or Fluoroscopy.  According to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, a woman above age 50 who is at average risk of breast cancer should get a mammogram test once every two years  until age 74 . 25 These new guidelines would expose women to less than half the amount of radiation from mammograms than following previous recommendations (which included annual mammograms starting at age 40 for women at average risk).  While these doses of radiation could cause new cases of breast cancer, the appropriate use of mammograms has resulted in lives saved, and the benefits of getting regular mammograms are likely to be even greater than the risks when the frequency of mammograms is reduced to every other year.  Women who are carriers of the BRCA genetic mutation were previously recommended to begin yearly mammograms at age 25-30, since this mutation puts them at much higher risk of getting breast cancer.  Newer studies have found that starting yearly mammograms before age 35 has no benefit to these women and may instead be harmful.  They end up with higher exposure to radiation over their lifetime, which increases the chance of getting radiation-induced breast cancer that they may not have gotten otherwise. 26  Fluoroscopy  Fluoroscopyis an x-ray test that allows doctors to see a continuous x-ray image of your body (like a movie, rather than just a picture as with other x-ray tests).  Fluoroscopy uses an x-ray absorbing dye that is either drunk or injected into the body, which allows doctors to see a better outline of the organ.  This procedure is used to view the digestive system (such as stomach, kidneys, or colon), arteries, or joints. 27  Since this test sends x-ray beams over an extended period of time (usually 20-60 minutes), 28 it exposes people to much higher doses of radiation than a simple x-ray test, although the doses vary widely depending on the test.  Fluoroscopy and CT scans both use high doses of radiation and pose the greatest and most avoidable risk of radiation-induced cancer.  Limiting the number of CT and fluoroscopy tests you receive is one of the best ways you can avoid getting cancer from radiation.  In addition to increasing cancer risk, this test can damage the skin and cause burns. 29  Computed Tomographic (CT) scans  CT Scans are a relatively new type of diagnostic imaging technology that allows doctors to view 3-dimentional pictures of various organs in your body.  CT scans use higher doses of radiation than most other types of diagnostic test and are likely to cause new cancers in some patients, compared to their risk if they had not received a CT scan.  Today, an American’s average lifetime dose of radiation from diagnostic procedures is six times higher than it was in the 1980s. 30 This is largely due to the increased use of CT scans. Everyday, 19,500 CT scans are performed in the U.S. and this number continues to climb. Each CT scan is equivalent to 30 – 442 chest x-rays, depending on the dose used for the CT scan. 31 One study projected that CT scans performed in the U.S. in 2007 alone will result in 29,000 new cancer cases and roughly 15,000 deaths that would not have occurred if they had not received a CT scan. 32 These risks would increase with each additional CT scan a person receives.  Low-dose CT scans, which expose patients to less radiation, are now being used to screen for lung cancer, with concerns about whether the benefits outweigh the risks.  For more information on low-dose CTs, click here .  Unfortunately, there is no established guideline for how much radiation should be used for each procedure.  Different scans require different levels of radiation in order to get a clear image, but some doctors are using more radiation than is necessary.  One study found that different medical facilities had huge variations in the dose of radiation used for the same procedure.  On average, the highest dose given for a CT scan was 13 times higher than the lowest does given for the same type of scan. 33 The researchers found no pattern in why this dose variation occurred, and no scientific justification.  Children’s exposure to radiation from CT scans is particularly worrisome because children have many more years to develop cancer than adults receiving CT scans and are more sensitive to the effects of radiation.  A June 2012 study found that children receiving higher doses of radiation — through multiple CT scans– were more likely to develop brain tumors and leukemia than children who had only one CT scan. 34 However, brain tumors and leukemia are very rare conditions and the increased risk due to CT scans was relatively small: for every 10,000 CT scans performed on children under 10 years-old, there will be one additional diagnosis of leukemia and one additional diagnosis of a brain tumor. The researchers concluded that the benefits of children having necessary CT scans outweighed the risks of later developing cancer.  A study published in May 2013 looked at children from infancy to 19 years of age in Australia and compared those who had undergone CT scans to those who had never had any. 35 Ten years after getting scanned,  there were 24% more cases of cancer among  the 680,000 children and teenagers who had CT scans than among the 10 million children and teenagers who did not undergo CT scans. Young people who had CT scans during the 12-month period before being diagnosed with cancer were not counted because the decision to scan them may have had to do with cancer symptoms.  Children 4 and under had the highest increased risk in cancer, and risk for all increased with the number of scans. The researchers concluded that for every 1,800 people under 20 who had a CT scan, there was 1 additional case of cancer that would not have occurred without the radiation from the CT scan. The CT scans in this study took place between 1985 and 2005 when radiation doses where generally higher than they are today.  Parents should make sure that CT scans ordered for their children are medically necessary and ask their doctors if lower-radiation alternatives exist. While parents should not stop their children from receiving a necessary CT scan because of radiation concerns, they should think about keeping the number of scans below age 20 to a minimum.  The FDA and investigative journalists have also released warnings about occurrence of extreme accidental overdoses of radiation from CT scans. 36 , 37  In January 2010, the FDA reported that over 250 patients at 4 facilities had received as much as 8 times the amount of radiation that they were supposed to receive. 38 Accidental radiation overdoses can result in skin redness, hair loss, increased risk of various cancers and cataracts in the future, and death.  While extreme overdoses of radiation are rare, these avoidable mistakes have lead many health professionals to call for more standardized and comprehensive methods of overseeing medical radiation. 39  ( Click here for more information on heart CT scans and cancer risk ).  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans  PET scans differ from other types of diagnostic imaging in that they allow doctors to see how an organ or system is functioning rather than just seeing the structure .  This test works in a very different way than other tests and does not use x-rays-rather, it uses gamma rays, which usually have a higher level of energy than x-rays.  PET scans work by injecting (or swallowing) small amounts of radioactive material, which then spreads throughout the body. The PET scanner is then used to detect the radiation that is emitting from the radioactive material in your body. Procedures that use radioactive material to diagnose and treat patients is referred to as “nuclear medicine.” 40  The dose of radiation from a PET scan is similar to CT, and therefore exposes people to a relatively high dose of radiation in comparison to other types of scans.  Using Radiation to Treat Cancer:  Radiation therapy  Radiation therapy uses high doses of radiation to treat various types of cancers.  Beams of radiation are directed at the cancer to kill off cancerous cells.  This can save lives and prevent recurrence of cancer, but healthy cells that are exposed to radiation may develop into a new cancer.  Fortunately, new cancers caused by radiation therapy are not thought to be very common since radiation technology can precisely irradiate a small part of the body that contains cancer, minimizing the amount of healthy cells that are exposed to radiation. 41  Another concern about radiation therapy and diagnostic tests are errors in using this technology. Although relatively uncommon, some patients will accidently receive doses that are too high.  In addition to being at increased risk of developing cancer in the future, the incorrect doses can cause serious wounds to the skin, bone, and other organs, as well as death. 42 , 43  Between 1950 and 2006, the frequency of diagnostic radiation increased 10-fold. 44 As health professionals continue to find new uses for medical devices that use radiation, people will be exposed to radiation more often. For example, many radiologists have recently started promoting the use of CT scans to screen for colon cancer (known as a virtual colonoscopy), although the FDA has not approved CT scans for this purpose. 45  Although many patients would prefer this non-invasive procedure over the traditional direct examinations, it would expose people to high doses of radiation that is roughly equal to 100 chest x-rays (or 3 years of background radiation. 46 This means more people are likely to be diagnosed with cancers that are caused by radiation than they would not have gotten otherwise.  Other Manufactured Devices that Use Radiation  Airport and Building X-ray Scans  Backscatter and millimeter scanners have begun replacing metal detectors and are designed to scan a person to determine what weapons or explosives they may have beneath their clothing. Currently, there are about 250 backscatter and 264 millimeter wave scanners in the United States. The TSA hopes to have 1,800 scanners of either type installed by the end of 2014 – which would mean that nearly every airport in the country will have one.  Backscatter scanners look like two large blue boxes:  (Source: Transportation Security Administration)  People raise their arms and stand sideways between these two boxes when they are scanned.  In contrast, millimeter wave scanners look like circular glass phone booths, and the person being scanned stands with their arms raised while part of the scanner rotates around them:  (Source: Transportation Security Administration, from http://www.tsa.gov/videos/travel-tips-advanced-imaging-technology)  If you are not sure which scanner is in use at your airport, ask a TSA official at the security checkpoint.  While metal detectors and millimeter scans both use non-ionizing radiation, which until recently was assumed to be safe (see our article Can Cell Phones Harm our Health? ), backscatter scans use ionizing radiation, which is used in x-rays and known to potentially increase the risk of cancer. Backscatter scans work a little differently from x-rays. X-rays work by sending high-energy radiation to the body and recording the radiation that passes through the body. Dense parts of the body (like bones) block some of the radiation, resulting in lighter areas on the recorded image.  Backscatter scanners also send radiation toward the body, but at much lower energy than an x-ray. Because it is not as strong as the radiation used in x-rays, the radiation does not pass through the body. Instead, the outer layers of the body “scatter” the radiation, which bounces off the body and back toward the machine. People receive most of the radiation that is absorbed by the body is deposited in the outer layers (like the skin and ribs), although a 2012 study showed that radiation from these scans may penetrate to other organs. 47 Because the radiation is concentrated in the skin, there are concerns that this could cause skin cancer.  All data on backscatter scans are provided by TSA, a government agency that does not allow independent researchers to examine the machines they use. 48 Researchers must therefore make educated guesses using data provided by the TSA, or they must make models of the scanners based on information that the agency releases.  The TSA states that backscatter scans use such low doses of radiation that estimating the potential effects of the scan is extremely difficult. 49 , 50 A 2011 report using information from the TSA found that these backscatter scans expose people to the same amount of radiation that they receive from 3 to 9 minutes of normal daily life or from 1 to 3 minutes of flight. 51 To put this into perspective, we would expect only 6 of the 100 million airline passengers each year to develop a cancer in their entire lives due to the backscatter scans.  Dr. David Brenner, a researcher at Columbia University, produced a different estimate based on the risk that the scanners are to the entire population, not just to an individual. 52 Dr. Brenner multiplied the risk associated with one scan by the number of scans conducted each year to estimate the number of people who may develop cancer in one year because of the scanners. Because up to one billion scans may be performed each year, Brenner estimated that each year 100 people would develop cancer because of their exposure.  In April 2010, a group of scientists from the University of California, San Francisco wrote a letter of concern to Dr. John Holdren, the Assistant to President Obama for Science and Technology, about the backscatter scans. These researchers pointed out that because backscatter scans only penetrate outer layers of the body, it is possible that these layers receive a higher concentration of radiation than previously believed.  The scientists also expressed concern that sperm may mutate because the testicles are close to the surface of the skin and are exposed to radiation during these backscatter scans. In addition, they noted that the effects of radiation on the cornea (the outer surface of the eye) and the thymus (a part of the immune system located in the chest) have not been studied. While this letter only outlined concerns of the scientists and did not present new data, it called for further testing of backscatter scans.  The scientists called for more rigorous and independent studies to ensure that the scans are safe for the entire population, as well as for all parts of the body.  In a joint reply with the TSA, the FDA stated that the radiation exposures from the backscatter scans were within established legal limits, even for frequent fliers. 53 In reply to the scientists’ concerns that the radiation dose to the skin would be higher, the FDA wrote that their calculations showed that a person would have to pass through the scanner 1000 times in a year in order to begin to absorb the annual limit of what is considered safe. 54  Not everyone agrees with the FDA, and some people have pointed out that TSA agents operating the scanners may improperly manage the devices or that mechanical errors may occur, either of which could cause the machines to emit more radiation than they are supposed to. From May 2010 to May 2011, there were 3,778 calls for mechanical problems on backscatter machines, but only 2% of those machines were evaluated for radiation safety. 55  For a more in-depth look at airport security and radiation, read here .  Microwaves, Cell Phones, and Other Manufactured Devices  There is still much debate among scientists about whether non-ionizing (low-energy) radiation such as microwaves can increase your risk of cancer or other health problems. The concern is not about microwave ovens, but rather the long-term exposures to microwaves from other sources, such as communication towers and cell phones. 56 Cell phones emit very low doses of microwave radiation, which was long assumed to be safe.  Although generally safer than ionizing radiation, the much longer-term exposure could make these products potentially dangerous. There are studies indicating that long-term exposures to low doses of non-ionizing radiation can damage DNA and may cause cancers and neurological and reproductive harm. 57 , 58  The rapid increase in use of cell phones and other wireless devices intensifies the need for further research on potential health effects of these non-ionizing radiation sources.

Tobacco, fertilizer, welding rods, smoke detectors, and several other consumer products also contain some radiation, but radiation from these sources is generally very low (approximately 3% of our yearly radiation dose.

Researchers reevaluate the safety of radiation used in medical imaging By Carina Storrs on July 1, 2013 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: Shannon Freshwater Advertisement  Ever since physicians started regularly ordering CT (computed tomography) scans four decades ago, researchers have worried that the medical imaging procedure could increase a patient's risk of developing cancer. CT scanners bombard the human body with x-ray beams, which can damage DNA and create mutations that spur cells to grow into tumors.  Doctors have always assumed, however, that the benefits outweigh the risks. The x-rays, which rotate around the head, chest or another body part, help to create a three-dimensional image that is much more detailed than pictures from a standard x-ray machine. But a single CT scan subjects the human body to between 150 and 1,100 times the radiation of a conventional x-ray, or around a year's worth of exposure to radiation from both natural and artificial sources in the environment.  A handful of studies published in the past decade have rekindled concerns. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute estimate that 29,000 future cancer cases could be attributed to the 72 million CT scans performed in the country in 2007. That increase is equivalent to about 2 percent of the total 1.7 million cancers diagnosed nationwide every year. A 2009 study of medical centers in the San Francisco Bay Area also calculated an elevated risk: one extra case of cancer for every 400 to 2,000 routine chest CT exams.  The reliability of such predictions depends, of course, on how scientists measure the underlying link between radiation and cancer in the first place. In fact, most estimates of the excess cancer risk from CT scans over the past several decades rely largely on a potentially misleading data set: cancer rates among the long-term survivors of the atomic bomb blasts in World War II.  “There are major concerns with taking the atomic bomb survivor data and trying to understand what the risk might be to people exposed to CT scans,” says David Richardson, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health who has done research on the atomic bomb survivors.  About 25,000 atomic bomb survivors were exposed to relatively low doses of radiation comparable to between one and three CT scans. The number of cancer cases that developed over the rest of their lives is not, however, large enough to provide the necessary statistical power to reliably predict the cancer risk associated with CT scans in the general population today. Given these difficulties, as well as renewed concerns about radiation levels and the lack of mandatory standards for safe CT exposure (in contrast to such procedures as mammography), a dozen groups of investigators around the world have decided to reevaluate the risk of CT radiation based on more complete evidence.  A growing number of clinicians and medical associations are not waiting for definitive results about health risks and have already begun figuring out how to reduce radiation levels. Two radiologists at Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, think that they can decrease the x-ray dosage of at least one common type of CT scan by 75 percent without significantly reducing image quality. Likewise, a few medical associations are trying to limit superfluous imaging and prevent clinicians from using too much radiation when CT scanning is necessary.  Outdated Data  For obvious ethical reasons, researchers cannot irradiate people solely to estimate the cancer risk of CT. So scientists turned to data about survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people died during the detonations and in the months following them. Most individuals within one kilometer of the bombings perished from acute radiation poisoning, falling debris or fires that erupted in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Some people within 2.5 kilometers of ground zero lived for years after exposure to varying levels of gamma rays, from a high end of more than three sieverts (Sv)—which can burn skin and cause hair loss—to a low end of five millisieverts (mSv), which is in the middle of the typical range for CT scans today (2 to 10 mSv). A sievert is an international unit for measuring the effects of different kinds of radiation on living tissue: 1 Sv of gamma rays causes the same amount of tissue damage as 1 Sv of x-rays.  Several years after the blasts, researchers began tracking rates of disease and death among more than 120,000 survivors. The results demonstrated, for the first time, that the cancer risk from radiation depends on the dose and that even very small doses can up the odds. Based on such data, a 2006 report from the National Research Council has estimated that exposure to 10 mSv—the approximate dose from a CT scan of the abdomen—increases the lifetime risk of developing any cancer by 0.1 percent. Using the same basic information, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that 10 mSv increases the risk of a fatal cancer by 0.05 percent. Because these risks are tiny compared with the natural incidence of cancer in the general population, they do not seem alarming. Any one person in the U.S. has a 20 percent chance of dying from cancer. Therefore, a single CT scan increases the average patient's risk of developing a fatal tumor from 20 to 20.05 percent.  All these estimates share a serious flaw. Among survivors exposed to 100 mSv of radiation or less—including the doses typical for CT scans—the numbers of cancer cases and deaths are so small that it becomes virtually impossible to be certain that they are significantly higher than the rate of cancer in the general population. To compensate, the National Research Council and others based their estimates primarily on data from survivors who were exposed to levels of radiation in the range of 100 mSv to 2 Sv. The fundamental assumption is that cancer risk and radiation dose have a similar relationship in high and low ranges—but that is not necessarily true.  Another complicating factor is that the atomic bombs exposed people's entire body to one large blast of gamma rays, whereas many patients receive multiple CT scans that concentrate several x-rays on one region of their body, making accurate comparisons tricky. Compounding this issue, the atomic bomb survivors typically had much poorer nutrition and less access to medical care compared with today's general U.S. population. Thus, the same level of radiation might correspond to greater illness in an atomic bomb survivor than in an otherwise healthy person from today.  Dialing Down the Dose  To conclusively determine the risk of low radiation doses and set new safety standards for CT radiation, researchers are beginning to abandon the atomic bomb survivor data and directly investigate the number of cancers among people who have received CT scans. About a dozen such studies from different countries examining rates of various cancers following CT scans will be published in the next few years.  In the meantime, some researchers have started testing whether good images can be produced with radiation doses lower than those generated in typical CT scans. Sarabjeet Singh, a radiologist at Mass General, and his fellow radiologist Mannudeep Kalra have an unusual way of conducting such investigations. Rather than recruiting living, breathing human volunteers for their studies, they work with cadavers. In that way, they can scan bodies many times without worrying about making people sick and can perform an autopsy to check whether the scan has correctly identified a medical problem.  So far the researchers have discovered that they can diagnose certain abnormal growths in the lungs and perform routine chest exams with about 75 percent less radiation than usual—a strategy Mass General has since adopted. Singh and Kalra are now sharing their methods with radiologists and technologists from hospitals and scanning centers across the U.S. and around the globe.  Medical associations are stepping in to help as well. Because the FDA does not regulate how CT scanners are used or set dose limits, different centers end up using an array of radiation doses—some of which seem unnecessarily high. In the past year the American Association of Physicists in Medicine has rolled out standardized procedures for adult CT exams that should rein in some of these outlier centers, Singh says. Furthermore, an increasing number of CT facilities across the U.S. receive accreditation from the American College of Radiology, which sets limits for radiation doses and evaluates image quality. In 2012 accreditation became mandatory for outpatient clinics that accept Medicare Part B if the facilities want to get reimbursed for scans.  No matter how much clinicians lower the levels of radiation used in individual CT exams, however, a problem remains. Many people still receive unnecessary CT scans and, along with them, unneeded doses of radiation. Bruce Hillman of the University of Virginia and other researchers worry that emergency room physicians in particular order too many CT scans, making quick decisions in high-pressure situations. In a 2004 poll 91 percent of ER doctors did not think a CT scan posed any cancer risk. Doctors and their patients may finally be getting the message. A 2012 analysis of Medicare data suggests that the previously rampant growth in CT procedures is flattening out and possibly waning.  “The jury is still out on whether there is a small cancer risk,” says Donald Frush, chief of pediatric radiology at Duke University Medical Center. “But the safest thing is to assume that no amount of radiation is safe. And if we find out in 20 years that a little bit was not harmful, then what did we lose by trying to minimize the dose?”   This article was originally published with the title "Do CT Scans Cause Cancer?"

The main risks are those associated with test results that demonstrate a benign or incidental finding , leading to unneeded, possibly invasive, follow-up tests that may present additional risks and the increased possibility of cancer induction from x-ray radiation exposure. The probability for absorbed x-rays to induce cancer or heritable mutations leading to genetically associated diseases in offspring is thought to be very small for radiation doses of the magnitude that are associated with CT procedures. Such estimates of cancer and genetically heritable risk from x-ray exposure have a broad range of statistical uncertainty, and there is some scientific controversy regarding the effects from very low doses and dose rates as discussed below. To date, there is no evidence of genetically heritable risk in humans from exposure to x-rays.  Under some rare circumstances of prolonged, high-dose exposure, x-rays can cause other adverse health effects, such as skin erythema (reddening), skin tissue injury, and birth defects following in-utero exposure. But at the exposure levels associated with most medical imaging procedures, including most CT procedures, these other adverse effects do not occur. Because of the rapidly growing use of pediatric CT and the potential for increased radiation exposure to children undergoing these scans, special considerations should be applied when using pediatric CT. Among children who have undergone CT scans, approximately one-third have had at least three scans. The National Cancer Institute and The Society for Pediatric Radiology developed a brochure, Radiation Risks and Pediatric Computed Tomography: A Guide for Health Care Providers , and the FDA issued a Public Health Notification, Reducing Radiation Risk from Computed Tomography for Pediatric and Small Adult Patients , that discuss the value of CT and the importance of minimizing the radiation dose, especially in children. See a recent article from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) titled, "Computed Tomography (CT) - An Increasing Source of Radiation Exposure" . Radiation Dose from CT Examinations The quantity most relevant for assessing the risk of cancer detriment from a CT procedure is the "effective dose" . The unit of measurement for effective dose is millisieverts (abbreviated mSv). Effective dose allows for comparison of the risk estimates associated with partial or whole-body radiation exposures. It also incorporates the different radiation sensitivities of the various organs in the body. Radiation dose from CT procedures varies from patient to patient. The particular radiation dose will depend on the size of the body part examined, the type of procedure, and the type of CT equipment and its operation. Typical values cited for radiation dose should be considered as estimates that cannot be precisely associated with any individual patient, examination, or type of CT system. The actual dose from a procedure could be two or three times larger or smaller than the estimates. Facilities performing "screening" procedures may adjust the radiation dose used to levels less (by factors such as 1/2 to 1/5 for so called "low dose CT scans") than those typically used for diagnostic CT procedures. However, no comprehensive data is available to permit estimation of the extent of this practice and reducing the dose can have an adverse impact on the image quality produced. Such reduced image quality may be acceptable in certain imaging applications. Estimates of the effective dose from a diagnostic CT procedure can vary by a factor of 10 or more depending on the type of CT procedure, patient size and the CT system and its operating technique. A list of representative diagnostic procedures and associated doses are given in Table 1.

Average effective dose in millisieverts (mSv) from McCollough CH, Bushberg JT, Fletcher JG, Eckel LJ. Answers to common questions about the use and safety of CT scans. Mayo Clin Proc. 2015;90(10):1380-92. The effective doses from diagnostic CT procedures are typically estimated to be in the range of 1 to 10 mSv. This range is not much less than the lowest doses of 5 to 20 mSv received by some of the Japanese survivors of the atomic bombs. These survivors, who are estimated to have experienced doses only slightly larger than those encountered in CT, have demonstrated a small but increased radiation-related excess relative risk for cancer mortality . Risk Estimates The effective doses from diagnostic CT procedures are typically estimated to be in the range of 1 to 10 mSv. This range is not much less than the lowest doses of 5 to 20 mSv estimated to have been received by some of the Japanese survivors of the atomic bombs. These survivors, who are estimated to have experienced doses slightly larger than those encountered in CT, have demonstrated a small but increased radiation-related excess relative risk for cancer mortality. The risk of developing cancer as a result of exposure to radiation depends on the part of the body exposed, the individual’s age at exposure, and the individual’s gender. For the purpose of radiation protection, a conservative approach that is generally used is to assume that the risk for adverse health effects from cancer is proportional to the amount of radiation dose absorbed and that there is no amount of radiation that is completely without risk. This conservative approach is called the “linear non-threshold” model. The amount of dose depends on the type of x-ray examination . A CT examination with an effective dose of 10 millisieverts (abbreviated mSv; 1 mSv = 1 mGy in the case of x-rays.) may be associated with an increase in the possibility of fatal cancer of approximately 1 chance in 2000. This increase in the possibility of a fatal cancer from radiation can be compared to the natural incidence of fatal cancer in the U.S. population, about 1 chance in 5 (equal to 400 chances in 2000). In other words, for any one person the risk of radiation-induced cancer is much smaller than the natural risk of cancer. If you combine the natural risk of a fatal cancer and the estimated risk from a 10 mSv CT scan, the total risk may increase from 400 chances in 2000 to 401 chances in 2000. Nevertheless, this small increase in radiation-associated cancer risk for an individual can become a public health concern if large numbers of people undergo increased numbers of CT screening procedures of uncertain benefit. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the risk estimates for low levels of radiation exposure as commonly experienced in diagnostic radiology procedures. This is because the risk is quite low compared to the natural risk of cancer. At low doses, the radiation-related excess risk, which is thought to be proportional to dose, tends to be dwarfed by statistical and other variation in the background risk level. To obtain adequate evidence for a statistically valid estimate of cancer risk from exposure to low doses of radiation would require studying millions of people for many years. There are some who question whether there is adequate evidence for a risk of cancer induction at low doses. Some scientists believe that low doses of radiation do not increase the risk of developing cancer at all, but this is a minority view.
