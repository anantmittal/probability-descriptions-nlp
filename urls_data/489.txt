Thompson  Palm Beach Post Staff Writer       1:26 p.m Monday, Dec. 16, 2013   Schools & Education                      0                 Like many of her friends and classmates, Chelsea Apparicio couldn’t wait to attend the University of Florida and become a member of Gator Nation.       The recent Suncoast High School grad thought she was a shoo-in. She was enrolled in the school’s International Baccalaureate diploma program. She was an honor society member. She scored 1900 on her SAT. She played varsity soccer since she was a freshman. She logged more than 500 community service hours and served as an ambassador for the school at functions as part of its Mr. and Miss Suncoast program.   “I was really well-rounded,” said Apparicio, 19. “I wasn’t just a book person.”   Florida State University accepted her. So did St. John’s University and the University of Central Florida.   But the University of Florida, Apparicio’s dream school, rejected her — even after she appealed the decision in person with letters of recommendations to the admissions office.   “My mom and I drove up at 4 a.m.,” said Apparicio, who lived in West Palm Beach while in high school. “I thought I deserved to get in and felt like it was a slap in the face.”   Apparicio, now a psychology and business major at FSU, is not alone.       With the Nov. 1 application deadline rapidly approaching, thousands of cream-of-the-crop high school seniors will once again be turned away by UF because competition to get into the state’s oldest school is at an all-time high. In recent years, admissions workers have been forced to choose among some of the brightest and most ambitious students in the state.   “The academic profile of students is getting stronger and stronger every year,” said Dr. Zina Evans, UF’s vice president for enrollment management and associate provost. “When you have more applications, but the same number of seats, then it does become that much more competitive.”   Last year, UF said it received more than 29,000 applications for only 6,400 openings. The university admitted a little over 11,000 students to fill those 6,400 spots. The school has more than 49,000 students for the fall semester.   “A lot of very qualified students simply can’t get in because we don’t have the resources for them,” said Steve Orlando, a UF spokesman. “We have a lot of demand and only limited space.”   Twenty years ago, about 13,000 applicants applied to UF. The school, when competition wasn’t as fierce, admitted a whopping 67 percent, considerably lower than the 43 percent UF accepted for the current fall term.   With the state encouraging dual enrollment, advanced placement courses and IB programs to better prepare high school students for college and beyond, more high achievers are applying to UF, said UF Provost Joseph Glover.   But as support for public colleges and universities dwindles, Glover said, UF, like so many other state universities, is handcuffed.   “We’re simply not in a position to accommodate that many students,” he said.   The university does not have the academic credentials of an Ivy League school, but to many Floridians, UF is the school to attend. The competition to get to Gainesville is becoming more like that at an Ivy League school.   Generations of Floridians, after all, have graduated from UF. Kids often want to attend UF because a parent or grandparent went there.   Clayton Lambert, a freshman aerospace major at UCF, wanted to go to UF for years. His older sister is a UF junior studying business.   “It’s the No. 1 school in the state, in my opinion,” said Lambert, who graduated from Atlantic High School in Delray Beach. “I would’ve felt like I was part of the same group when I was in high school. I would’ve felt right at home there.”   Like Apparicio, the 18-year-old Lambert believed he had the perfect high school resume for UF — swim team captain, cross-country team captain, chess team member, AP courses, IB program graduate.   But Lambert didn’t make the UF cut, either.   “I was heartbroken,” he said. “The year before, almost all the kids in the IB program at Atlantic got into UF and I know I had similar credentials. I thought it was unfair.”   UF, still the only Florida school to belong to the American Association of Universities, has the most rigorous admissions requirements of the state schools and is ranked highest nationally. It placed 17th among public universities and tied for 54th among all national universities in U.S. News & World Report ’s college rankings released last month. Last year, UF ranked 19th among public universities and 58th among all national universities. By turning away more than half of its freshman applicants, UF, some parents say, has developed a reputation of being an elite school.   School faculty, however, sniff at the snooty tag.   “I don’t think we’ve become elitist,” Evans said. “We don’t come into the year and say, ‘Gee, we want to have this academic profile.’ Quite frankly, it’s the students who are pushing this and taking more challenging courses and doing better and better.”   UF’s average freshman profile reads like this: 4.3 GPA, 1958 SAT score, 30 ACT score. According to princetonreview.com, the national average for the SAT is 1500 and 21 for ACT.   By comparison, the average GPA for freshmen entering UCF last fall was 3.8. It was 3.9 at FSU, 3.8 at USF and 3.7 at Florida International University.   But UF said it looks beyond test scores and grades when deciding whom to admit. The school said it’s looking for leaders, students who know how to set themselves apart and are willing to challenge themselves inside — and outside — the classroom.   “If you won your high school science fair, that’s wonderful,” Orlando said. “But if you tell us that you got a patent on something you invented, that’s the kind of thing we’re looking for.”   Evans said applicants should carefully note their high school accomplishments, not just their grades.   “Sometimes students will spend their time telling us that they took this class and got that grade, but we know that already because we have your transcript,” said Evans. “If there was something inspiring that came from the experience that we can’t find elsewhere, tell us that.”   Evans also said the school is turned off by potential students who believe it’s enough to simply list the clubs and organizations they’ve joined.   “We’re much more interested in the breadth and engagement than we are in a laundry list,” Evans said. “Listing 52 things you did for an hour here or there is not nearly as impressive as showing your commitment to a particular project or program. We’re looking at trends over time.”   That’s what Apparicio believes she did on her application. While appealing her decision, she said she was told in the admissions office that UF sets a cap on the number of students it can accept from each high school.   Orlando, however, disputed that claim.   “We don’t set quotas for specific high schools,” he said.   Still, Apparicio said she’s happy at FSU and decided against applying to UF again after her freshman year.   “At first it stunk that I didn’t get into UF,” she said. “But I fell in love with FSU and the psychology program.”   Lambert, who wants to design planes for a living, said he plans to stay at UCF.   “People seem more accepting here,” he said. “I visited UF recently and I was getting a lot of crap from all the kids who go there, saying how much better UF is than UCF. But things are going really well here for me.”   Meanwhile, Evans said she understands the frustration students feel when they’re rejected by their dream university.   “We acknowledge that many other students could do very well here,” she said. “We wish we could offer places for more of them but, unfortunately, we can’t.”                                         View Comments 0                            Most Read     Best Pizza in Every State: The winners are…    2018 NFL Draft: Miami Dolphins Rounds 1-3 Todd McShay Picks | The Daily Dolphin    Son arrested in missing Boca Raton man’s murder          Things To Do      Add Event +  See More                            Weather and Traffic       89  33401                    1                    Most Read     Best Pizza in Every State: The winners are…    2018 NFL Draft: Miami Dolphins Rounds 1-3 Todd McShay Picks | The Daily Dolphin    Son arrested in missing Boca Raton man’s murder          Things To Do      Add Event +  See More                        More from palmbeachpost.com    Topics         News     Sports     Life                  Sports    When will the nation’s No. 1 overall recruit return to LSU?

In this guide, we'll discuss what scores are needed for you to get admitted into University of Florida. You'll also get to calculate your own chances with our admissions calculator.  Location: Gainesville, FL  This school is also known as: UF   University of Florida Admissions Statistics  There are three critical numbers when considering your admissions chances: ACT scores, GPA, and acceptance rate . All these combine to tell you what you scores are required to get into University of Florida.    Average ACT: 28   The average ACT score composite at University of Florida is a 28 .   The 25th percentile ACT score is 27, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 31.  In other words, a 27 places you below average, while a 31 will move you up to above average. There's no absolute ACT requirement at University of Florida, but they really want to see at least a 27 to have a chance at being considered.

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Average GPA: 3.73   The average GPA at University of Florida is 3.73 . This makes University of Florida Strongly Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
    
    This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.73, University of Florida
      
      requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, with a leaning toward A's. If you took some AP or IB classes, this will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.73, you'll need a higher ACT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 48%   The acceptance rate at University of Florida is 48% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, 48 are admitted.   This means the school is somewhat selective . You should prepare your academic scores well, but you have an excellent chance if you impress them.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring at a 28 ACT or above will already give you a great shot at getting in. Scoring a 31 will nearly guarantee you admission, given that your GPA is roughly the average of 3.73.    Admissions Calculator    What are your chances of admission at University of Florida?   Chances of admission with these scores:   Here's our custom admissions calculator. Plug in your numbers to see what your chances of getting in are. Pick your test: ACT    ACT Score      Your GPA       Note: Your admission decision relies not only on your GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but also on your coursework difficulty, extracurriculars, letters of recommendation, and personal statements. This tool provides only a simplistic estimate of your chances of admission. Instead of treating this tool as a crystal ball, we recommend you consider the big picture of what your chance means:  80-100%: Safety school: Strong chance of getting in  50-80%: More likely than not getting in  20-50%: Lower but still good chance of getting in  5-20%: Reach school: Unlikely to get in, but still have a shot  0-5%: Hard reach school: Very difficult to get in  We recommend you apply to schools across a range of chances.

On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1874 .    University of Florida SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1250, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1420.

If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Average GPA: 3.71   The average GPA at University of Florida is 3.71 . This makes University of Florida Strongly Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
    
    This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.71, University of Florida
      
      requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, with a leaning toward A's. If you took some AP or IB classes, this will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.71, you'll need a higher SAT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 48%   The acceptance rate at University of Florida is 48% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, 48 are admitted.   This means the school is somewhat selective . You should prepare your academic scores well, but you have an excellent chance if you impress them.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring at a 1874 SAT or above will already give you a great shot at getting in. Scoring a 2020 will nearly guarantee you admission, given that your GPA is roughly the average of 3.71.

Pick your test: Old SAT  New SAT  ACT    SAT Score      Your GPA       Note: Your admission decision relies not only on your GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but also on your coursework difficulty, extracurriculars, letters of recommendation, and personal statements. This tool provides only a simplistic estimate of your chances of admission.

University of Florida typically requires applicants to be in the top 18 percent of SAT test takers .  The school consistently takes SAT composite scores down to 1250 on a 1600 scale, below which admission should be considered a reach.  We estimate some students could be accepted with SAT's as low as 1165.  The estimated average SAT composite for admitted freshman is 1335 out of 1600. A competitive SAT score is critical as 78 percent of applicants submit SAT scores to the school.

We estimate the school accepting minimum ACT composite scores around 25 in some instances.

I think they like the out-of-state tuition the students pay, so they're more lenient with their applications.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     sushipanda    Registered User  Posts: 117  Junior Member      June 2017    edited June 2017       The average weighted GPA this year was 4.45 and will likely be 4.5+ next year when students apply. I've seen people on this thread get in with 4.2 GPA's this year, but they all seem to be OOS kids. Someone told me that if you can afford to pay OOS tuition without any financial need, it'll boost your application, but I have no idea how the whole system works. Others told me that UF likes geographical diversity, etc.  They're all still rumors to me, but it's something to keep in mind, I guess.  Also, last year they didn't accept a single student who had below a 3.25-3 GPA, and only about 0.1% of the students they took had around a 3.3-3.5 GPA.

If your school (like mine) only allows you to take AP's in 11th and 12th your GPA will never be this high. Probably should mention UF is aware of rampant GPA inflation and will compare you to your classmates (GPA indicates how competitive you are within your school, ACT/SAT compares you with everyone else).  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     sushipanda    Registered User  Posts: 117  Junior Member      June 2017    edited June 2017        @Jnjrs Idk about the indicator thing within the school. They probably do compare you to your classmates but it doesn't seem like it has much weight. Half of my class has above a 4.5 UF GPA and they've regularly accepted at least 90% of our class each year for the past 10+ years, so even if my school is grade inflated (which it isn't), they still seem to have a preference for these schools.  They accept a lot more kids from schools who offer more APs as opposed to those that don't. Here in Alachua, our 3 main feeder schools allow their kids to take 22+ AP classes and basically everyone gets in, whereas my friend in Miami claims that UF only accepted 7 people from her school. The ACT/SAT thing isn't really used as a big indicator either. I think as long as you're in the top %'s of your class at a school that doesn't offer many APs, you'll be okay, but my guess is that they'd take the kid who has a 4.5 GPA and is Top-50% of his class over the kid with a 4.1 GPA and is Top-25%. Just a guess, though, but the evidence I've observed seems to support it.  On their common data set, UF flagged the SAT as less important than GPA and they even said on their website that they consider coursework and GPA to be the most important factors during admissions.  "Please note that the University of Florida considers classroom performance an excellent indicator of college coursework success, and therefore places more emphasis on grades and the challenge of the high school curriculum (including the senior-year schedule)."  Also, @mpancake UF doesn't consider major during admissions, it's only used for placement. I know that if you choose a PaCE major they know they can put you in PaCE, but that's about all it's used for, I think.   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     Jnjrs    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      June 2017        @sushipanda You make a good point. All i know is that an admissions officer told me they recieve your schools curriculum and judge you based on that. A 4.4 gpa is weighted differently depending on the school you go to, and is considered in conjunction with course rigor. A 4.4 will not be impressive to UF if all you took were easy honor classes. About your school: I do believe thats just a causal relationship. Better schools typically offer more AP's/harder courses, but not all schools that offer more AP's are better schools. Besides, UF's hollistic admissions means its practically impossible to accurately predict admissions based on academics.  PS. Is Harvard good because its Harvard? Or does the student make the institution? I don't believe UF likes a particular school more than another, rather if the students are very (insert what UF wants in 2017 here) the students will be accepted individually based on their own merits and not on school brand name. Your school sounds like one full with motivated students who would probably get accepted to UF regardless of where they attend.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     CaucAsianDad    Registered User  Posts: 616  Member      June 2017       I agree with @Jnjrs  I also think the GCs make a difference.  Some are better at advising, prepping and directing the right applicants to UF admission.  My D's school sends very few students to UF, not because it is not a good school, but I believe it is because the GCs do not advise the students well for UF admissions.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         Sign In or Register to comment.

New Discussion What are my chances of getting into UF?       idkwhatimdoin    Registered User  Posts: 21  New Member      January 27    edited January 27   in University of Florida      I guess it's pointless even asking this question, but I'm just curious.  So I got accepted into FSU, what are the chances of getting in UF in comparison? Do they have the same requirements?  I have pretty low test scores (compared to everyone else - 1250 on the SAT...I'm a bad test taker) but I have a really high GPA. I have a 3.9 unweighted and 4.7 weighted GPA. I'm number one in my class and I've taken 5 AP classes (all the AP classes my school offers) and 12 dual enrollment classes. I'm in a good amount of clubs, including Beta, National Honors Society, Theatre, Great Decisions, Teens for Change, and a few more. I go to a very small school (we only have 700 kids and the grades range from 6th to 12th), so this is 90% of the clubs it offers. However, I've never played any sport. I'm not the athletic type, haha. I believe my essay was pretty good, as well. Writing is my strong suit. I know I don't sound great compared to everyone else on here, but I'm just curious as to what my chances of getting into UF are. Also, I live in Florida, if that is relevant in any way. Thanks in advance! Good luck to everyone.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook      Replies to: What are my chances of getting into UF?       #1     danielle6849    Registered User  Posts: 72  Junior Member      January 28       Well, I'd be interested in hearing what others have to say because my son has almost the same exact stats. He's not number one in his class, but he's in the top 8%. 5.4 gpa, 3.92 unweighted. His SATs were only 1250, which is going to hurt his chances.  He did get into UMD, FSU (engineering), UDel (engineering), Rutgers (engineering), and USF (engineering). Of course he wants UF. Haha. I guess we'll find out in a few weeks! Good luck!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     Gator88NE    Registered User  Posts: 5,838  Senior Member      January 28       With holistic admissions, chancing is like reading tea leaves....  UF does put more importance's on GPA/Class Rigor, the essay and EC's, than on test scores. For example, 73% of enrolled freshman (2016-2017 CDS info), were in the top 10% of their class, 95% was in the top 25%.   MIDDLE 50% FOR THE CLASS OF 2021: Academic Core GPA: 4.3-4.6 SAT: 1280-1430 ACT: 28-32   Being in the middle 50% is no guarantee of acceptance, but it gives you an idea and a range to shoot for. Remember, about 50% of admissions is based on nonacademic factors.  Good Luck!   1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     shortnuke    Registered User  Posts: 407  Member      January 28       It looks like your SAT score is the only thing that doesn't "sound great compared to everyone else".  Fortunately, according to UF's Common Data Set, standardized test scores are considered "important" whereas GPA, class rigor, and essays are considered "very important" ( https://ir.aa.ufl.edu/media/iraaufledu/common-data-set/Main_cds2016-2017.pdf ).  Assuming you're using the same weighted GPA formula that UF uses, your grades are above the mid-range while your SAT scores are  just below ( http://www.admissions.ufl.edu/blog/2017/02/27/admitted-class-profile.html ).  I'd say you have a decent chance, but it's always difficult to guess with holistic admissions.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     idkwhatimdoin    Registered User  Posts: 21  New Member      January 28       Thanks for your input, everyone!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     idkwhatimdoin    Registered User  Posts: 21  New Member      February 9       Update: I got in! :)   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     hammer510    Registered User  Posts: 7  New Member      February 22       Congratulations!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     Parman37    Registered User  Posts: 121  Junior Member      February 23       So happy for you!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         Sign In or Register to comment.

New Discussion Chances for UF       JDGatorfan    Registered User  Posts: 22  Junior Member      November 2017   in University of Florida      Posting for my daughter as I'm a curious alum.  Unweighted GPA: 3.5 UF GPA: 3.94 SAT: 1270 State Of Residence: Florida Male / Female: Female Summer or Fall: Summer Class rank: 16%  AP's: World History, Environmental Science, Human Geography, Psychology, Language and Composition, Computer Science, Calculus, Literature  EC: Girl Scout Gold Award, project was 80+ hours, including creating an elementary school lesson plan on healthy eating and presenting the course to about 200 kids. Also built a website to sustain the project. She spent 10 years in Girl Scouts. She's also in other organizations like NHS and the future educators with another 100+ hours.  Volunteering- More than 350 hours at a university affiliated pre-school for kids with and without special needs.  Volunteered during three consecutive high school summers. Did it on her own with no prodding from her parents.  Awards: numerous for her community service including some high profile honors.  "Hooks": attended a pre-college program at UF (CPET) this past summer - they loved her.  From a family of Gators. Also went on the tour and spent a lot of time on the application.  Is UF first choice? Yes  Other schools applied for: Accepted to UNF, UCF, USF, FGCU. Pending at FSU and UF.  Major/Field of Study: Digital Arts and Sciences in Engineering  Comments: We know ii's a reach. GPA is the big weakness, but grades have improved each year.  She's a monster on meaningful, long-term ECs,and wrote her essay about what she learned from volunteering with kids.  Curious to hear thoughts from the group.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook      Replies to: Chances for UF       #1     Trisherella    Registered User  Posts: 1,096  Senior Member      November 2017       Clearly the GPA and test scores aren't in her favor (i.e. they won't be what gets her in). However they're not terrible, and UF likes to see its applicants challenge themselves in their coursework, which your daughter is definitely doing. (A 4.0 in all "regular" courses wouldn't be as impressive, IMO)  Her extracurriculars look super strong, and that IS something that will give her an edge in the applicant pool! (unfortunately being a legacy doesn't seem to count for much these days)  Also the girl scout project sounds really interesting, I hope she had time to touch on that in her essay. (Even if she didn't, hopefully she was able to briefly describe it elsewhere because it really does sound unusual) With a strong essay and a strong extracurrucular interest, I think her chances are pretty good.  Certainly not definite, but a very decent chance.  Fingers crossed for you!  2   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     GatorDad305    Registered User  Posts: 41  Junior Member      November 2017       thanks.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     JDGatorfan    Registered User  Posts: 22  Junior Member      January 7        @Gator88NE , would love your feedback as you seem like the UF goto!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     Gator88NE    Registered User  Posts: 5,838  Senior Member      January 7       Well, I think @Trisherella nailed it. Her GPA and test scores are a bit low, but class rigor and ECs are strong. The essay really matters, especially for your daughter, who's EC's are so strong.  It's really hard to say anything about her chances, other than she does have a chance, with students matching her stats getting into UF. So much depends on her EC's, and essay, which are subjective.  Check out section C of the Common Data set (if you haven't already):   https://ir.aa.ufl.edu/media/iraaufledu/common-data-set/CDS_2017-2018_UFMain_Dec2017.pdf  Keep in mind that 25% of the students admitted to UF have the same or lower test scores and GPA.  Even if not admitted, it's fairly easy (if you have the college grades) to transfer into UF's Digital Arts and Sciences in Engineering program (it's not crazy competitive like Mechanical engineering or finance), so going to UNF or UCF for a year or two (likely with a merit based scholarship to help pay for the cost) and then transferring to UF is not a bad option!  Good Luck!  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     JDGatorfan    Registered User  Posts: 22  Junior Member      January 7       Thank you @Gator88NE .  Excellent feedback and guidance.  I read the Washington Post article from this week, which you also shared, and one impression it gives is that the holistic admissions is meant to identify students with hardships of one kind or another but not necessarily late bloomers or kids with strong leadership yet borderline numbers.  It was a bit disheartening, to be honest.  thanks again to you and @Trisherella .  In a month, we will know for sure.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     Gator88NE    Registered User  Posts: 5,838  Senior Member      January 8       This holistic stuff is all mystic mumbo jumbo to me. :)  I've gone though waiting till the "2nd Friday in February" with two kids and it's never fun. It does help to have several other acceptances lined up, while you wait...  After listening to AO's on a few campus tours, etc., it's clear that they do value leadership (it's something they called out). In general, what they value is effort and time. They want to say, He/She had these grades while taking these courses and doing this stuff (EC, sports, etc.). That's why they value, something like work, as a plus. The student wasn't setting around all day playing video games and studying for class, they also worked, competed in sports, volunteered, etc. They are more impressed with someone with a 3.5 GPA that worked 20 hours a week, than someone with a 3.7 GPA that didn't.  Overcoming hardships is also highly valued (to what degree? who knows). I think (based on ZERO insider knowledge) it's used as a proxy to make the class more racially and socially (low income students) diversified (in the state of Florida, you can't use race in admissions). About 25% of UF's freshman receive Pell Grants.  On the other hand, I saw that one year about 35% to 40% of UF freshman were legacies..   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     JDGatorfan    Registered User  Posts: 22  Junior Member      February 9       End result: my daughter was offered Gator Engineering at Santa Fe.

I think you're ok.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #8     CORNandTOOTHPICK    -  Posts: 130  Junior Member      January 2013       I think UF GPA is what they consider most. While the range is 4.0 - 4.6, the dead average is 4.38. And for those who know statistics, apparently the modulus rests in 4.38 (meaning instead of people everywhere on the range and that average is 4.38, it is that so many people are dead on 4.38 with few spacing around the range (extrema)).  Normally, I'd say it wouldn't matter, but statistically your drawn back a bit. Still you have a chance.  I've also received my AA before HS, but I've heard dual enrollment isn't all that preferred if you hadn't taken much AP. (Luckily I did). Not sure about 4 APs. Your SAT is a bit below average, but your ACT is acceptable. Good ECs.  I should ask, how well do you think you did on essay and what is your race/ethnicity?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     itsalltina    Registered User  Posts: 20  New Member      January 2013       I'm not exactly sure how my essay turned out but I believe it was somewhat well written. And I'm Hispanic, and come from a low income family if that makes any difference.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     CORNandTOOTHPICK    -  Posts: 130  Junior Member      January 2013       Not sure but I think Hispanics are a minority so that might help. Being poor doesn't help (I'm poor too lol). It does for federal aid. :)   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     itsalltina    Registered User  Posts: 20  New Member      January 2013       I'm so nervous lol, thank you for the input!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #12     ilovethe47    -  Posts: 250  Junior Member      January 2013       Since you asked for an opinion I'll provide you mine. Based on my calculations your estimated University of Florida grade-point average is about a 4.1 . Since your grade point average and SAT scores are below average your chances are probably below average. But remember take this with a grain of salt. You will know for sure in a mat..ter of weeks good luck.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #13     Gailbeth7719    Registered User  Posts: 174  Junior Member      January 2013       just to know- my daughter got in last year and had a 3.91 weighted UF gap and a 25 act .  NO APs or dual anything and she is OOS.  Good luck- you never know and she loves it!!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #14     BornToBeaGator    Registered User  Posts: 125  Junior Member      January 2013       CORNANDTOOTHPICK is incorrect. The 25th-75th percentile range of UF GPA is 4.0- 4.4 with the "dead in the middle average" being a 4.2 UF GPA.  Source: University of Florida - Admissions  Also: UF does NOT take race into account. However, if you worked your financial disadvantage into your Essay and how you had to overcome it, that could help you. Your SAT is kind of low...but recalculate your UF GPA for a better "chance."  How to calculate: Only take academic courses, add 1 point to a 4.0 for AP classes, and .5 for Honors classes. An "A" in an AP is worth a 5.0. A "B" in an honors is worth a 3.5.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #15     itsalltina    Registered User  Posts: 20  New Member      January 2013       Again, if it helps, I have over 400 community service hours  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook        « 1 2 »      Go    This discussion has been closed.

Thompson  Palm Beach Post Staff Writer       1:26 p.m Monday, Dec. 16, 2013   Schools & Education                      0                 Like many of her friends and classmates, Chelsea Apparicio couldn’t wait to attend the University of Florida and become a member of Gator Nation.       The recent Suncoast High School grad thought she was a shoo-in. She was enrolled in the school’s International Baccalaureate diploma program. She was an honor society member. She scored 1900 on her SAT. She played varsity soccer since she was a freshman. She logged more than 500 community service hours and served as an ambassador for the school at functions as part of its Mr. and Miss Suncoast program.   “I was really well-rounded,” said Apparicio, 19. “I wasn’t just a book person.”   Florida State University accepted her. So did St. John’s University and the University of Central Florida.   But the University of Florida, Apparicio’s dream school, rejected her — even after she appealed the decision in person with letters of recommendations to the admissions office.   “My mom and I drove up at 4 a.m.,” said Apparicio, who lived in West Palm Beach while in high school. “I thought I deserved to get in and felt like it was a slap in the face.”   Apparicio, now a psychology and business major at FSU, is not alone.       With the Nov. 1 application deadline rapidly approaching, thousands of cream-of-the-crop high school seniors will once again be turned away by UF because competition to get into the state’s oldest school is at an all-time high. In recent years, admissions workers have been forced to choose among some of the brightest and most ambitious students in the state.   “The academic profile of students is getting stronger and stronger every year,” said Dr. Zina Evans, UF’s vice president for enrollment management and associate provost. “When you have more applications, but the same number of seats, then it does become that much more competitive.”   Last year, UF said it received more than 29,000 applications for only 6,400 openings. The university admitted a little over 11,000 students to fill those 6,400 spots. The school has more than 49,000 students for the fall semester.   “A lot of very qualified students simply can’t get in because we don’t have the resources for them,” said Steve Orlando, a UF spokesman. “We have a lot of demand and only limited space.”   Twenty years ago, about 13,000 applicants applied to UF. The school, when competition wasn’t as fierce, admitted a whopping 67 percent, considerably lower than the 43 percent UF accepted for the current fall term.   With the state encouraging dual enrollment, advanced placement courses and IB programs to better prepare high school students for college and beyond, more high achievers are applying to UF, said UF Provost Joseph Glover.   But as support for public colleges and universities dwindles, Glover said, UF, like so many other state universities, is handcuffed.   “We’re simply not in a position to accommodate that many students,” he said.   The university does not have the academic credentials of an Ivy League school, but to many Floridians, UF is the school to attend. The competition to get to Gainesville is becoming more like that at an Ivy League school.   Generations of Floridians, after all, have graduated from UF. Kids often want to attend UF because a parent or grandparent went there.   Clayton Lambert, a freshman aerospace major at UCF, wanted to go to UF for years. His older sister is a UF junior studying business.   “It’s the No. 1 school in the state, in my opinion,” said Lambert, who graduated from Atlantic High School in Delray Beach. “I would’ve felt like I was part of the same group when I was in high school. I would’ve felt right at home there.”   Like Apparicio, the 18-year-old Lambert believed he had the perfect high school resume for UF — swim team captain, cross-country team captain, chess team member, AP courses, IB program graduate.   But Lambert didn’t make the UF cut, either.   “I was heartbroken,” he said. “The year before, almost all the kids in the IB program at Atlantic got into UF and I know I had similar credentials. I thought it was unfair.”   UF, still the only Florida school to belong to the American Association of Universities, has the most rigorous admissions requirements of the state schools and is ranked highest nationally. It placed 17th among public universities and tied for 54th among all national universities in U.S. News & World Report ’s college rankings released last month. Last year, UF ranked 19th among public universities and 58th among all national universities. By turning away more than half of its freshman applicants, UF, some parents say, has developed a reputation of being an elite school.   School faculty, however, sniff at the snooty tag.   “I don’t think we’ve become elitist,” Evans said. “We don’t come into the year and say, ‘Gee, we want to have this academic profile.’ Quite frankly, it’s the students who are pushing this and taking more challenging courses and doing better and better.”   UF’s average freshman profile reads like this: 4.3 GPA, 1958 SAT score, 30 ACT score. According to princetonreview.com, the national average for the SAT is 1500 and 21 for ACT.   By comparison, the average GPA for freshmen entering UCF last fall was 3.8. It was 3.9 at FSU, 3.8 at USF and 3.7 at Florida International University.   But UF said it looks beyond test scores and grades when deciding whom to admit. The school said it’s looking for leaders, students who know how to set themselves apart and are willing to challenge themselves inside — and outside — the classroom.   “If you won your high school science fair, that’s wonderful,” Orlando said. “But if you tell us that you got a patent on something you invented, that’s the kind of thing we’re looking for.”   Evans said applicants should carefully note their high school accomplishments, not just their grades.   “Sometimes students will spend their time telling us that they took this class and got that grade, but we know that already because we have your transcript,” said Evans. “If there was something inspiring that came from the experience that we can’t find elsewhere, tell us that.”   Evans also said the school is turned off by potential students who believe it’s enough to simply list the clubs and organizations they’ve joined.   “We’re much more interested in the breadth and engagement than we are in a laundry list,” Evans said. “Listing 52 things you did for an hour here or there is not nearly as impressive as showing your commitment to a particular project or program. We’re looking at trends over time.”   That’s what Apparicio believes she did on her application. While appealing her decision, she said she was told in the admissions office that UF sets a cap on the number of students it can accept from each high school.   Orlando, however, disputed that claim.   “We don’t set quotas for specific high schools,” he said.   Still, Apparicio said she’s happy at FSU and decided against applying to UF again after her freshman year.   “At first it stunk that I didn’t get into UF,” she said. “But I fell in love with FSU and the psychology program.”   Lambert, who wants to design planes for a living, said he plans to stay at UCF.   “People seem more accepting here,” he said. “I visited UF recently and I was getting a lot of crap from all the kids who go there, saying how much better UF is than UCF. But things are going really well here for me.”   Meanwhile, Evans said she understands the frustration students feel when they’re rejected by their dream university.   “We acknowledge that many other students could do very well here,” she said. “We wish we could offer places for more of them but, unfortunately, we can’t.”                                         View Comments 0                            Most Read     Best Pizza in Every State: The winners are…    2018 NFL Draft: Miami Dolphins Rounds 1-3 Todd McShay Picks | The Daily Dolphin    Son arrested in missing Boca Raton man’s murder          Things To Do      Add Event +  See More                            Weather and Traffic       89  33401                    1                    Most Read     Best Pizza in Every State: The winners are…    2018 NFL Draft: Miami Dolphins Rounds 1-3 Todd McShay Picks | The Daily Dolphin    Son arrested in missing Boca Raton man’s murder          Things To Do      Add Event +  See More                        More from palmbeachpost.com    Topics         News     Sports     Life                  Sports    When will the nation’s No. 1 overall recruit return to LSU?

I'm in chemical engineering now. It's all math and chemistry. It's differential equations.  I don't mean to discourage you, but you need to think if that's even the route you want to go.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Tenzouu  4 points 5 points 6 points  1 year ago  (0 children) You seem pretty solid except for your class ranking. A very well written essay should guarantee you admission into at least the summer term.   permalink embed save give gold [–] ryrypk777  2 points 3 points 4 points  1 year ago  (0 children) Write a good essay   permalink embed save give gold [–] DwyaneWade305  1 point 2 points 3 points  1 year ago  (1 child) The only two flaws in your application is the low class rank and the (2?) D's on your transcript. The only thing you can do now to help your chances is write a great essay. If I could give you some advice do not stress about this throughout your senior year. I was getting so nervous/stressed that I just started looking at other schools and realized that I would still be happy with the other colleges I got into if I got rejected by UF.   permalink embed save give gold [–] hdmetric99 [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  1 year ago  (0 children) Thank you!

I was in nearly
 every club and honor society I could as well, but I have noticed that they like people with sports backgrounds so that might give you a shot.  P.

However, the low grades definitely will impact your chances.  For the awards section, college doesn't really care too much about middle school, so don't bother putting those awards in. That section is usually pretty empty unless you're super decorated and just applying to UF as a backup, anyways.  I think your chances look pretty good, I think? You didn't make the 25th percentile, but 31 is pretty close, and honestly colleges don't really care about your GPA too much as long as the unweighted(I think?) is above 3.75 (I think?). Not too sure about the last bit.  Just write a damn good essay.   permalink embed save give gold [–] thesushipanda  1 point 2 points 3 points  1 year ago *  (0 children) I know it's super late but I'm just going to reply so future readers know.  If you had a pretty rigorous schedule, a GPA below 3.75 could be looked over. I had many friends get into UF with GPAs of 3.5's or 3.6's because they took 18-21 AP/IB classes in high school, and everything else was Honors. I believe UF looks at your recalculated GPA, that way kids who didn't take any Honors/APs won't have an advantage over a kid with a lower UW GPA but had many AP's.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] valentinogirl1  -1 points 0 points 1 point  1 year ago  (0 children) you'll get in trust me your scores are fine   permalink embed save give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

However my counsel told me that my gpa most likely would keep me from getting in. I have a 3.19 unweighted gpa, however I am an IB student and will get my IB diploma, with a 1450 on the sat and a 30 on the act, also I am going to get my eagle scout.

Otherwise, UF weights your GPA by adding a 0.5 to any honors/pre-AP/pre-IB course you have completed, and adding 1.0 to any full AP/IB/AICE/Dual Enrollment course. Additionally, we only look at courses from the five main subject areas (Math, Science, Social Science, English, Foreign Language).  Last year, our freshman class had an average GPA range of 4.3 to 4.6 on our scale, but academics makes up only half of the application review. UF does a holistic review, meaning we look at all of your extra-curriculars and of course, your essay, which are all extremely important too. So even if your GPA comes out to be a little less than the average, don't let that stop you from applying! The only thing that guarantees you won't get in is not applying.   permalink embed save give gold [–] HoldMyTacoz  2 points 3 points 4 points  8 months ago  (4 children) Depends on your UF weighted GPA.   permalink embed save give gold [–] MrFloridaGuy [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  8 months ago  (3 children) Can I Calculate that now?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] HoldMyTacoz  5 points 6 points 7 points  8 months ago  (1 child) If your weighted GPA is >4.0, you'll have a solid chance.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] thesushipanda  2 points 3 points 4 points  8 months ago *  (0 children) Not really. The average was 4.45 this year and next year it'll probably be around 4.5.  The only people who I know got in with a 4.0-4.1 this year were people who were out of state and could fully pay UF 35k a year without financial assistance. I believe UF does consider financial aid need during admissions, so OOS kids might have a huge advantage similar to how International applicants do. Even when my sister applied in 2007, her 4.0 UF GPA still wasn't enough.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] zachxo Undergraduate  1 point 2 points 3 points  8 months ago  (0 children) I got in with a 1260 on the SAT last year and a 3.8 GPA unweighted (4.5 on UF scale). I also had enough dual enrollment to get an AA. If you write a good essay your SAT and ACT scores will overcome your GPA and you may have a shot at getting in. I would spend a lot of time on your essay and get it proofread a couple times.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Battkitty2398  0 points 1 point 2 points  8 months ago  (0 children) I was an IB student ( I got the diploma) with a 4.1 weighted gpa, I did NHS, Beta club, Drama Club, Interact Club, I was the Historian of my school's FBLA chapter (and I went to Nationals). I also got a 32 on the ACT (34 superscore but UF doesn't super score the ACT so keep that in mind) and I still didn't get in :( But if you don't get in it's not the end of the world, just go to Santa Fe for 2 years and then transfer.   permalink embed save give gold [–] lucasgadot  0 points 1 point 2 points  8 months ago  (0 children) honestly, if all else fails, start in Summer A or Summer B, much more likely to make it in. 
My friend did APs, bombed his ACT, but was haitian and did extra currics and got in during the Summer A classes and then took classes in the fall and so on. 
I had somewhere like a 4.7 gpa when graduating highschool, did some extra currics, and a 29 ACT score and did not get in the fall semester.  I was also expelled from my original high school so I think that may have factored into the equation.  All is well now, I am a grad student and really enjoy UF.
good luck.   permalink embed save give gold [–] -Knockabout  0 points 1 point 2 points  8 months ago  (0 children) Eagle Scout should honestly help a lot. I had the Gold Award when I applied, and I was accepted over my friend, who had similar grades but no community service-like extracurriculars. However, I had a 4.5 and a 33 on the ACT. If you want to improve your chances, ACT could be a good place to start.   permalink embed save give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

If I do well this semester, maybe 4.1. 2000 on SAT, 4 year varsity soccer player, 2 defensive player of the year awards (but it was only for our team), got all county 2nd team in my Sophomore year and 1st team in my junior year ( this is pretty much the best players get in the paper), chess club president, and a few basic jobs (no hours, just working for my dad and helping this old guy in my neighborhood with his medical issue but i did go there every other morning for 2 years.) Also I'm certified in adobe photoshop and illustrator. I don't know if all these things are relevant, but I would greatly appreciate any feedback. Also what are the negatives of going to the Innovation Academy? I want to major in computer science. Are there any drawbacks on this major if I do go to the innovation academy?   9 comments share save hide report all 9 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion? Post a comment! Create an account [–] Natehoop  5 points 6 points 7 points  2 years ago  (3 children) Your credentials are really good and I'd assume you'd get in without Innovation academy. Innovation academy requires you to minor in innovation and you can't take fall classes and stuff, it's not fun. People don't really like it as far as I've heard.  My credentials weren't nearly as good as yours, and I didn't get in but several of my friends did with worse credentials than yours (IB school). I ended up doing the Gator Engineering at Santa Fe program, which is where you do the first few classes, Calc 1, 2, 3 and diff eq, Physics 1 and 2, and Chem 1 at Santa Fe, and some of your Gen eds for the first few semesters at SF, and then you become a full UF student. I'm currently taking my last class at SF, Chem 1, and the rest of my classes at UF, and I'm starting my 3rd semester.  Obviously this would only be an option if you didn't get in, which I assume you would, but you never know. I think the program is great, because all those classes that you take at SF like Chem and Physics are the "drop out courses" at UF, designed to make people drop out of Engineering. It's pretty ridiculous how hard they make the early classes. You also graduate as a full UF student so it's the exact same. Most UF students end up taking a few classes at SF anyway, because they're easier and cheaper.   permalink embed save give gold [–] wizsanta [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Thanks.

I may be wrong about that though. But if you are on the 80th percentiles or above you should be fine.  If you want to do computer science try to start learning code already if you haven't, it will probably look good on your application. Also, do some kind of community service if you can.  Anyone here have any thoughts on Innovation Academy vs. 2 years Community college?   permalink embed save [–] b0x0fawes0me Student  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (2 children) Computer science major in innovation academy here. DO NOT GO INTO INNOVATION ACADEMY IF YOU ARE DOING COMPUTER SCIENCE. Holy fuck, it was the worst mistake I've ever made. IA is designed for business majors and they decided to slap a few other majors (eg computer science) in to make the program more "well-rounded". Well, it isn't. You're going to be stuck here for an extra semester to a year if you do IA when you can graduate in 4 years if you just do regular UF. That might sound fun but it isn't when money is an issue. All the IA internships are business/marketing. I cannot stress enough how much you don't want to do IA.  If you're concerned about getting in, apply to summer B. You have a better chance of getting in and after you complete your 6 weeks during the summer, you will be on a regular schedule the rest of the year. I wish I would have done this every day. Getting out of IA is near impossible.  Please... don't make the same mistake I did. Save yourself.  EDIT: Also, Summer classes fucking SUCK! (All the professors are gone, you're stuck with shitty TAs teaching for the first time in their lives, education quality is close to zero, ESPECIALLY for college of engineering prereqs such as physics, calc, chem, etc, which are all the ones you have to take in the summer if you want to graduate on time because they're the only ones on your schedule that are actually offered in the summer). If you do IA you will have at least 4 FULL 12-week summer semesters (not just summer B). I'm getting so mad about my life typing this all up... there are just... so many problems with IA.   permalink embed save give gold [–] wizsanta [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Well you just made IA not an option for me. Thanks for the advice!   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] b0x0fawes0me Student  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Glad I could save someone from the evil clutches of IA ;) good luck with everything!   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Chef_a_la_Ducky  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Also, a lot of companies that I've talked to through info sessions only do internships during the summer. If you are an IA student, you have to take summer which could hurt your chances with many companies.   permalink embed save give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

Nearly all successful applicants have above average grades and standardized test scores. In the graph above, the blue and green dots represent accepted students. The majority of students who got in had an unweighted high school GPA of 3.2 or higher, SAT scores (RW+M) of 1000 or higher, and ACT composite scores over 20. The higher those numbers are, the more likely a student is to be accepted, and admitted students typically have "A" level grades and standardized test scores that are well above average. As you can see in the middle of the graph, there's a lot of red (rejected students) hidden behind the blue and green.

Data courtesy of Cappex.   Note that a few students were accepted with test scores and grades a bit below the norm. The University of Florida has holistic admissions , so the admissions officers are evaluating students based on more than numerical data. To quote from the UF website : "Admissions is more art than science. The admissions process is designed to consider all aspects of an applicant’s academic record and personal experiences, and is not intended to admit applicants solely on the basis of grade point averages and test scores." In other words, students who show some kind of special talent, unusual background,  or interesting story to tell will often get a close look even if grades and test scores aren't quite up to the ideal. A winning essay and meaningful extracurricular activities can mean the difference between an acceptance and a rejection.

Data courtesy of Cappex.   The graph of rejection data illustrates the reality of holistic admissions at selective universities: some students with excellent grades and standardized test scores do not get admitted. The University of Florida looks for students who excel both inside and outside of the classroom, so strong academics by themselves may not be enough to get in. If it doesn't look like an applicant will contribute to the richness and diversity of the UF campus community in a meaningful way, that student is likely to receive a rejection letter.

It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida that traces its origins to 1853, [7] and has operated continuously on its Gainesville campus since September 1906. [8]  The University of Florida is one of sixty-two elected member institutions of the Association of American Universities (AAU), the association of preeminent North American research universities, and the only AAU member university in Florida. [9] The University is classified as a Research University with Very High Research by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching . [10] After the Florida state legislature's creation of performance standards in 2013, the Florida Board of Governors designated the University of Florida as one of the two "preeminent universities" among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida. [11] [12] For 2018, U.S. News & World Report ranked Florida as the ninth (tied) best public university in the United States. [13]  The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). It is the third largest Florida university by student population , [14] and is the eighth largest single-campus university in the United States with 54,854 students enrolled for the fall 2016 semester. [15] The University of Florida is home to sixteen academic colleges and more than 150 research centers and institutes. It offers multiple graduate professional programs—including business administration , engineering , law , dentistry , medicine , and veterinary medicine —on one contiguous campus, and administers 123 master's degree programs and seventy-six doctoral degree programs in eighty-seven schools and departments. The university's seal is also the seal of the state of Florida which is on the state flag.  The University of Florida's intercollegiate sports teams, commonly known by their " Florida Gators " nickname, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In their 111-year history, the university's varsity sports teams have won 40 national team championships, 35 of which are NCAA titles, and Florida athletes have won 275 individual national championships. [16] In addition, University of Florida students and alumni have won 126 Olympic medals including 60 gold medals .

The University of Florida traces its origins to 1853, when the East Florida Seminary , the oldest of the University of Florida's four predecessor institutions, was founded in Ocala, Florida .  On January 6, 1853, Governor Thomas Brown signed a bill that provided public support for higher education in Florida. [18] Gilbert Kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation, and established the East Florida Seminary , which operated until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. The East Florida Seminary was Florida's first state-supported institution of higher learning. [19]  James Henry Roper, an educator from North Carolina and a state senator from Alachua County , had opened a school in Gainesville, the Gainesville Academy , in 1858. In 1866, [20] Roper offered his land and school to the State of Florida in exchange for the East Florida Seminary's relocation to Gainesville. [21]  The second major precursor to the University of Florida was the Florida Agricultural College , established at Lake City by Jordan Probst in 1884. Florida Agricultural College became the state's first land-grant college under the Morrill Act . In 1903, the Florida Legislature, desiring to expand the school's outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins, changed the name of Florida Agricultural College to the "University of Florida," a name the school would hold for only two years. [22]  "University of the State of Florida" [ edit ]  In 1905, the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act , which consolidated the state's publicly supported higher education institutions. The member of the legislature who wrote the act, Henry Holland Buckman , later became the namesake of Buckman Hall , one of the first buildings constructed on the new university's campus. [23] The Buckman Act organized the State University System of Florida and created the Florida Board of Control to govern the system. It also abolished the six pre-existing state-supported institutions of higher education, and consolidated the assets and academic programs of four of them to form the new " University of the State of Florida ." The four predecessor institutions consolidated to form the new university included the University of Florida at Lake City (formerly Florida Agricultural College) in Lake City , the East Florida Seminary in Gainesville, the St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School in St. Petersburg , and the South Florida Military College in Bartow . [24]  The Buckman Act also consolidated the colleges and schools into three institutions segregated by race and gender—the University of the State of Florida for white men, the Florida Female College for white women, and the State Normal School for Colored Students for African-American men and women. [25]  The City of Gainesville, led by its Mayor William Reuben Thomas , campaigned to be home to the new university. [26] On July 6, 1905, the Board of Control selected Gainesville for the new university campus. Andrew Sledd , president of the pre-existing University of Florida at Lake City , was selected to be the first president of the new University of the State of Florida. The 1905-1906 academic year was a year of transition; the new University of the State of Florida was legally created, but operated on the campus of the old University of Florida in Lake City until the first buildings on the new campus in Gainesville were complete. Architect William A. Edwards designed the first official campus buildings in the Collegiate Gothic style. Classes began on the new Gainesville campus on September 26, 1906, with 102 students enrolled.  In 1909, the school's name was simplified from the "University of the State of Florida" to the "University of Florida."  The alligator was incidentally chosen as the school mascot in 1911, after a local vendor ordered and sold school pennants imprinted with an alligator emblem. The school colors, orange and blue, are a reference to the region's heritage and an homage to the Scottish and Ulster-Scots Presbyterian heritage of the original founders of Gainesville and Alachua County, most of whom were settlers from North Carolina whose ancestors were primarily Presbyterians of Scottish descent who had come to America from County Down and County Antrim in what has become Northern Ireland , while some had come directly from the Scottish Lowlands . [27] [28] [29]  [30]     Statue of Albert Murphree , the second president of the university.    College reorganization [ edit ]  In 1909, Albert Murphree was appointed the university's second president, and organized several of the colleges of the university, increased enrollment from under 200 to over 2,000, and he was instrumental in the founding of the Florida Blue Key leadership society. Murphree is the only University of Florida president honored with a statue on the campus.  In 1924, the Florida Legislature mandated women of a "mature age" (at least twenty-one years old) who had completed sixty semester hours from a "reputable educational institution" would be allowed to enroll during regular semesters at the University of Florida in programs that were unavailable at Florida State College for Women. Before this, only the summer semester was coeducational, to accommodate women teachers who wanted to further their education during the summer break. [31]  Lassie Goodbread-Black from Lake City became the first woman to enroll at the University of Florida, in the College of Agriculture in 1925. [32]  John J. Tigert became the third university president in 1928. Disgusted by the under-the-table payments being made by universities to athletes, Tigert established the grant-in-aid athletic scholarship program in the early 1930s, which was the genesis of the modern athletic scholarship plan used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association . [33]  Post World War II [ edit ]  Beginning in 1946, there was dramatically increased interest among male applicants who wanted to attend the University of Florida, mostly returning World War II veterans who could attend college under the GI Bill of Rights (Servicemen's Readjustment Act). Unable to immediately accommodate this increased demand, the Florida Board of Control opened the Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida on the campus of Florida State College for Women in Tallahassee . [34] By the end of the 1946–47 school year, 954 men were enrolled at the Tallahassee Branch. The following semester, the Florida Legislature returned the Florida State College for Women to coeducational status and renamed it Florida State University . These events also opened up all of the colleges that comprise the University of Florida to female students. African-American students were allowed to enroll starting in 1958. [35]  Shands Hospital opened in 1958 along with the University of Florida College of Medicine to join the established College of Pharmacy . Rapid campus expansion began in the 1950s and continues today. [36]  The University of Florida is one of two Florida public universities, along with Florida State University , to be designated as a "preeminent university" by Florida senate bill 1076, enacted by the Florida legislature and signed into law by the governor in 2013. [37] As a result, the preeminent universities receive additional funding intended to improve the academics and national reputation of higher education within the state of Florida. [38]  National and international prominence [ edit ]     The University of Florida campus in 1916, looking southwest.    In 1985, the University of Florida was invited to join the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization of sixty-two academically prominent public and private research universities in the United States and Canada. Florida is one of the seventeen public, land-grant universities that belong to the AAU. In 2009, President Bernie Machen and the University of Florida Board of Trustees announced a major policy transition for the university. The Board of Trustees supported the reduction in the number of undergraduates and the shift of financial and other academic resources to graduate education and research. [39] In 2017, the University of Florida became the first university in the state of Florida to crack the top ten best public universities according to U.S. News. [40] As of 2016 the University of Florida generated $791.3 Million in Research Expenditures.

The ratio of women to men is 55:45, and 32 percent are graduate and professional students. Professional degree programs include architecture, dentistry, law, medicine, pharmacy and veterinary medicine. Minority populations make up about 36 percent of the student body, with 6.5 percent African-Americans, 21.0 percent Hispanics, 0.5 percent Native American, and 7.9 percent Asian-Americans or Pacific Islanders. [47] According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency , UF has "the largest Jewish student body in the US." [48]  In 2016, the total number of International students attending the university was 5,169. [49]  The University of Florida is ranked second overall in the United States for the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to African-Americans, and third overall for Hispanics. [50] The university ranks fifth in the number of doctoral degrees awarded to African-Americans, and second overall for Hispanics, and third in number of professional degrees awarded to African-Americans, and second overall for Hispanics. [50] The university offers multiple graduate programs—-including engineering, business, law and medicine—-on one contiguous campus, and coordinates 123 master's degree programs and 76 doctoral degree programs in 87 schools and departments.

[73]  The 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities list assessed the University of Florida as 90th among world universities and 45th in the United States in 2016, based on overall research output and faculty awards. In 2016, Washington Monthly ranked the University of Florida 18th among national universities, with criteria based on research, community service, and social mobility. [74] The lowest national ranking received by the university from a major publication comes from Forbes which ranked the university 78th in the nation in August 2016. [75] This ranking focuses mainly on net positive financial impact, in contrast to other rankings, and generally ranks liberal arts colleges above most research universities. [76]  In 2013, Florida Governor Rick Scott announced his support for the University of Florida to ascend into the top ten among public universities, as measured by U.S. News & World Report . [77] He called for funding to decrease the student-faculty ratio at the university.  Florida was ranked 14th in The Princeton Review ' s 2015 list of top party schools. [78] It also was named the number one vegan-friendly school for 2014, according to a survey conducted by PETA . [79]  On Forbes’ 2016 list of Best Value Public Colleges, UF was ranked second. It was also ranked third on Forbes’ Overall Best Value Colleges Nationwide. [80]  Colleges and academic divisions [ edit ]  The University of Florida is divided into 16 colleges and more than 150 research, service and education centers, bureaus and institutes, offering more than 100 undergraduate majors and 200 graduate degrees. [81] [82]  These colleges include:    College/school founding [83]    College/school  Year founded        College of Agricultural and Life Sciences  1906    Rinker School of Building Construction  1906    College of Education  1906    Levin College of Law  1909    College of Engineering  1910    College of Liberal Arts and Sciences  1910    College of Pharmacy  1923    College of Journalism and Communications  1925    College of Design Construction and Planning  1925    Warrington College of Business  1926    P.K.

The average GPA for the admitted students was a 4.4, the average SAT was a 1364 out of 1600, and the average ACT was a 30 out of 36. [85]  Ending early decision [ edit ]  In 2007, the University of Florida joined the University of Virginia , Harvard University , the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , and Princeton University in announcing they were discontinuing their early decision admissions to foster economic diversity in their student bodies. [86] These universities assert early decision admissions forces students to accept an offer of admission before evaluating the financial aid offers from multiple universities. The university's single application deadline is November 1. [87]  Honors program [ edit ]     The Honors Residential College at Hume Hall provides residential and classroom facilities for students in the Honors Program.    The University of Florida has an honors program ; [88] After they are accepted to the university, students must apply separately to the Honors Program and show significant academic achievement to be accepted. There are over 100 courses offered exclusively to students in this program. [89] In 2011, more than 1900 students applied for 700 available seats. The Honors Program also offers housing for freshman in the Honors Residential College at Hume Hall . The program also offers special scholarships , internships , research, and study abroad opportunities. [90] [91]  Scholarships [ edit ]  The Lombardi Scholars Program, created in 2002 and named in honor of the university's ninth president John V. Lombardi , is a merit scholarship for Florida students. The scholarship offers $2,700 a semester for eight to ten semesters. [92] [93]  The J. Wayne Reitz Scholars Program, created in 1997 and named in honor of the university's fifth president J. Wayne Reitz , is a leadership and merit-based scholarship for Florida students. Its yearly $2,500 stipend may be renewed for up to three years. [94] [95]  The Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars Program was created in 2005. This is a full grant and scholarship financial aid package designed to help new, low-income UF students that are the first to attend college in their families. Every year, 300 scholarships are awarded to incoming freshmen with an average family income of $18,408. [96]  Sustainability [ edit ]     Opened in 2003, Rinker Hall was the first building on campus to receive LEED recognition. Since opening, other new and renovated buildings on campus have also received certification.    In 2005, the University of Florida became a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary for environmental and wildlife management, resource conservation, environmental education, waste management, and outreach.

[121]  The International Center for Lightning Research and Testing [ edit ]        This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (November 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Florida has more lightning than any other U.S. state. [122] UF sponsors the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT), which occupies over 100 acres (40 ha) at the Camp Blanding Army National Guard Base., [123] about 25 miles (45 km) northeast of UF's campus in Gainesville, Florida. One of their primary research tools is lightning initiation from overhead thunderclouds, using the triggered lightning rocket-and-wire technique. Small sounding rockets, connected to long copper wires, are fired into likely lightning storm cumulonimbus clouds. When the rocket—or its wire—is struck by lightning, the passing of the high-voltage lightning strike down the wire vaporizes it as the lightning travels to the ground. Undergraduate and graduate research in UF's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering's Lightning Research Group is used to increase new fundamental knowledge about lightning-based phenomena.  UF Health [ edit ]  University of Florida Health has two campuses in Gainesville and Jacksonville.

The university's student government operates on a yearly $18.7 million budget, one of the largest student government budgets in the United States, and the money is allocated by the Budget Committee of the Student Senate. [158]  The student government was established in 1909 and consists of executive, judicial and unicameral legislative branches. The executive branch includes the student government president, vice president and treasurer elected by the student body during the spring semester, as well as nine agencies and forty-one cabinet members.  The Student Senate is the legislative branch, and is composed of 100 senators who serve one-year terms. The student body elects fifty senators during each spring semester and the remaining fifty during the fall semester. The senators elect a Senate President and Senate President Pro Tempore twice a year, after each semester's elections, to lead the Student Senate. During student government elections students may also vote on referendums, such as the renewable energy referendum, [159] which was approved by 78% of voting students in the spring of 2007. This referendum proposed a fifty-cents-per-credit-hour increase to student activity fees to fund renewable energy and efficiency on campus.  The student government judicial branch has two major components: the Supreme Court of the Student Body (headed by a Chief Justice) and all elections related officials (the Supervisor of Elections and the Elections Commission). The Supreme Court consists of seven second or third-year law students nominated by the Student Body President and confirmed by the Student Senate. Each justice serves a "life-time" term, which extends through the individual justice's graduation and insulates the court from the politics of student government. The Chief Justice may appoint a marshal and clerk. The election commission is also composed of law students and it adjudicates all student government election complaints. The commission has six members, one of whom also serves as the commission chairman.  The student government executive branch is led by the Student Body President and includes the Student Body Vice President, Student Body Treasurer, twelve agencies, twelve executive secretaries, nineteen cabinet directors, and three cabinet chairs.

[183]  In popular culture [ edit ]  The University of Florida has been portrayed in several books, [184] [185] movies [186] and television shows. In addition, the University of Florida campus has been the backdrop for a number of different books and movies. Robert Cade , a professor in the university's College of Medicine , was the leader of the research team that invented the ubiquitous sports drink Gatorade as a hydration supplement for the Florida Gators football team in 1965–66.

The University of Florida's intercollegiate sports teams, known as the " Florida Gators ," compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). [188] The Gators compete in nine men's sports and twelve women's sports.  For the 2014–15 school year, the University Athletic Association budgeted more $100 million for its sports teams and facilities. Since 1987–88, the Gators have won twenty-three of the last twenty-six SEC All-Sports Trophies, recognizing Florida as the best overall athletics program in the SEC. [189] Florida is the only program in the nation to finish among the nation's top ten in each of the last thirty national all-sports standings and is the only SEC school to place 100 or more student-athletes on the Academic Honor Roll each of the last fifteen years. [190]  The Florida Gators have won a total of thirty-five national team championships, [191] thirty of which are NCAA championships. Florida Gators athletes have also won 267 NCAA championships in individual sports events. [192] Florida is one of only two Division I FBS universities to win multiple national championships in each of the two most popular NCAA sports: football (1996, 2006, 2008) and men's basketball (2006, 2007).  Football [ edit ]  Main article: Florida Gators football     Aerial of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium , also known as "The Swamp."    The University of Florida fielded its first official varsity football team in the fall of 1906, when the university held its first classes on its new Gainesville campus. Since then, the Florida Gators football team has played in 40 bowl games, won three consensus national championships and eight Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships, produced 89 first-team All-Americans, 45 National Football League (NFL) first-round draft choices, and three Heisman Trophy winners.  The Gators won their first post-season game on January 1, 1953, beating Tulsa 14-13 in Jacksonville, Florida. The Gators' first major bowl win was the 1967 Orange Bowl in which coach Ray Graves and Heisman Trophy quarterback Steve Spurrier led the Gators to a 27–12 victory over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets .  In 1990, Spurrier returned to his alma mater as its new head coach, and spurred the Gators to their first six official SEC football championships. The Gators, quarterbacked by their second Heisman Trophy winner, Danny Wuerffel , won their first national championship in 1996 with a 52–20 victory over Florida State Seminoles in the Sugar Bowl . In 2006, Urban Meyer coached the Gators to a 13–1 record, capturing their seventh SEC Championship , and defeating the top-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes 41–14 for the BCS National Championship . In 2008, the Gators' third Heisman-winning quarterback, Tim Tebow , led them in a 24–14 BCS Championship Game victory over the Oklahoma Sooners for the team's third national championship.  Since 1930, the Gators' home field has been Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium , which seats 88,548 fans. The stadium is popularly known as "The Swamp."

Under Donovan, the Gators won their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament championship in 2005, beating the Kentucky Wildcats . After repeating as SEC tournament champions in 2006, the Gators won their first basketball national championship, defeating the UCLA Bruins 73–57 in the final game of the NCAA basketball tournament. [195]  The Gators beat the Arkansas Razorbacks 77–56 to win their third consecutive SEC tournament title in 2007. [196] Florida defeated Ohio State 84–75 to again win the NCAA basketball tournament championship.  The Gators play their home games in the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center . [197] The 10,133-seat multi-purpose indoor arena was completed in 1980 and underwent massive renovations during the 2016-17 season. The arena is popularly known as the "O'Dome."

Gators Always.    As Gators, we're motivated by more than winning. It's about answering to a higher calling and playing for a purpose greater than ourselves. It's a difference seen on the field and heard across campus. It's why we've been able to fill stadiums and trophy shelves. It's what happens when you’re more than an individual, more than a team. We're one nation. And when we're united, we're unstoppable.         97     UF student-athletes have earned a total of 97 Academic All-America honors since 1992.         100     UF is the only SEC school to place 100 or more student-athletes on the academic honor roll each of the last 16 years.         33     UF is the only program to finish among the nation’s top 10 in each of the last 33 national all-sports standings.                 The Gator Way  We are committed to building athletes that are dominant on and off the field. As Gators, earning a degree is just as important as winning a title. UF not only leads the SEC, but we score a top-10 national ranking in Academic All-Americans.  Academics           The Office of Student Life  As a showcase to our commitment to academic development, we are renovating our office of student life.

C'mon Gators, get up and Go  Winning is just one of our favorite gameday traditions. For 10 years students have lined the sidewalk across from The Swamp the night before every home game for a chance at getting a weekly 'Beat' T-shirt. Two and a half hours prior to each home game, fans gather at the north end of the stadium to welcome the players into The Swamp. Welcome to The Gator Nation.

Thompson  Palm Beach Post Staff Writer       1:26 p.m Monday, Dec. 16, 2013   Schools & Education                      0                 Like many of her friends and classmates, Chelsea Apparicio couldn’t wait to attend the University of Florida and become a member of Gator Nation.       The recent Suncoast High School grad thought she was a shoo-in. She was enrolled in the school’s International Baccalaureate diploma program. She was an honor society member. She scored 1900 on her SAT. She played varsity soccer since she was a freshman. She logged more than 500 community service hours and served as an ambassador for the school at functions as part of its Mr. and Miss Suncoast program.   “I was really well-rounded,” said Apparicio, 19. “I wasn’t just a book person.”   Florida State University accepted her. So did St. John’s University and the University of Central Florida.   But the University of Florida, Apparicio’s dream school, rejected her — even after she appealed the decision in person with letters of recommendations to the admissions office.   “My mom and I drove up at 4 a.m.,” said Apparicio, who lived in West Palm Beach while in high school. “I thought I deserved to get in and felt like it was a slap in the face.”   Apparicio, now a psychology and business major at FSU, is not alone.       With the Nov. 1 application deadline rapidly approaching, thousands of cream-of-the-crop high school seniors will once again be turned away by UF because competition to get into the state’s oldest school is at an all-time high. In recent years, admissions workers have been forced to choose among some of the brightest and most ambitious students in the state.   “The academic profile of students is getting stronger and stronger every year,” said Dr. Zina Evans, UF’s vice president for enrollment management and associate provost. “When you have more applications, but the same number of seats, then it does become that much more competitive.”   Last year, UF said it received more than 29,000 applications for only 6,400 openings. The university admitted a little over 11,000 students to fill those 6,400 spots. The school has more than 49,000 students for the fall semester.   “A lot of very qualified students simply can’t get in because we don’t have the resources for them,” said Steve Orlando, a UF spokesman. “We have a lot of demand and only limited space.”   Twenty years ago, about 13,000 applicants applied to UF. The school, when competition wasn’t as fierce, admitted a whopping 67 percent, considerably lower than the 43 percent UF accepted for the current fall term.   With the state encouraging dual enrollment, advanced placement courses and IB programs to better prepare high school students for college and beyond, more high achievers are applying to UF, said UF Provost Joseph Glover.   But as support for public colleges and universities dwindles, Glover said, UF, like so many other state universities, is handcuffed.   “We’re simply not in a position to accommodate that many students,” he said.   The university does not have the academic credentials of an Ivy League school, but to many Floridians, UF is the school to attend. The competition to get to Gainesville is becoming more like that at an Ivy League school.   Generations of Floridians, after all, have graduated from UF. Kids often want to attend UF because a parent or grandparent went there.   Clayton Lambert, a freshman aerospace major at UCF, wanted to go to UF for years. His older sister is a UF junior studying business.   “It’s the No. 1 school in the state, in my opinion,” said Lambert, who graduated from Atlantic High School in Delray Beach. “I would’ve felt like I was part of the same group when I was in high school. I would’ve felt right at home there.”   Like Apparicio, the 18-year-old Lambert believed he had the perfect high school resume for UF — swim team captain, cross-country team captain, chess team member, AP courses, IB program graduate.   But Lambert didn’t make the UF cut, either.   “I was heartbroken,” he said. “The year before, almost all the kids in the IB program at Atlantic got into UF and I know I had similar credentials. I thought it was unfair.”   UF, still the only Florida school to belong to the American Association of Universities, has the most rigorous admissions requirements of the state schools and is ranked highest nationally. It placed 17th among public universities and tied for 54th among all national universities in U.S. News & World Report ’s college rankings released last month. Last year, UF ranked 19th among public universities and 58th among all national universities. By turning away more than half of its freshman applicants, UF, some parents say, has developed a reputation of being an elite school.   School faculty, however, sniff at the snooty tag.   “I don’t think we’ve become elitist,” Evans said. “We don’t come into the year and say, ‘Gee, we want to have this academic profile.’ Quite frankly, it’s the students who are pushing this and taking more challenging courses and doing better and better.”   UF’s average freshman profile reads like this: 4.3 GPA, 1958 SAT score, 30 ACT score. According to princetonreview.com, the national average for the SAT is 1500 and 21 for ACT.   By comparison, the average GPA for freshmen entering UCF last fall was 3.8. It was 3.9 at FSU, 3.8 at USF and 3.7 at Florida International University.   But UF said it looks beyond test scores and grades when deciding whom to admit. The school said it’s looking for leaders, students who know how to set themselves apart and are willing to challenge themselves inside — and outside — the classroom.   “If you won your high school science fair, that’s wonderful,” Orlando said. “But if you tell us that you got a patent on something you invented, that’s the kind of thing we’re looking for.”   Evans said applicants should carefully note their high school accomplishments, not just their grades.   “Sometimes students will spend their time telling us that they took this class and got that grade, but we know that already because we have your transcript,” said Evans. “If there was something inspiring that came from the experience that we can’t find elsewhere, tell us that.”   Evans also said the school is turned off by potential students who believe it’s enough to simply list the clubs and organizations they’ve joined.   “We’re much more interested in the breadth and engagement than we are in a laundry list,” Evans said. “Listing 52 things you did for an hour here or there is not nearly as impressive as showing your commitment to a particular project or program. We’re looking at trends over time.”   That’s what Apparicio believes she did on her application. While appealing her decision, she said she was told in the admissions office that UF sets a cap on the number of students it can accept from each high school.   Orlando, however, disputed that claim.   “We don’t set quotas for specific high schools,” he said.   Still, Apparicio said she’s happy at FSU and decided against applying to UF again after her freshman year.   “At first it stunk that I didn’t get into UF,” she said. “But I fell in love with FSU and the psychology program.”   Lambert, who wants to design planes for a living, said he plans to stay at UCF.   “People seem more accepting here,” he said. “I visited UF recently and I was getting a lot of crap from all the kids who go there, saying how much better UF is than UCF. But things are going really well here for me.”   Meanwhile, Evans said she understands the frustration students feel when they’re rejected by their dream university.   “We acknowledge that many other students could do very well here,” she said. “We wish we could offer places for more of them but, unfortunately, we can’t.”                                         View Comments 0                            Most Read     Best Pizza in Every State: The winners are…    2018 NFL Draft: Miami Dolphins Rounds 1-3 Todd McShay Picks | The Daily Dolphin    Son arrested in missing Boca Raton man’s murder          Things To Do      Add Event +  See More                            Weather and Traffic       89  33401                    1                    Most Read     Best Pizza in Every State: The winners are…    2018 NFL Draft: Miami Dolphins Rounds 1-3 Todd McShay Picks | The Daily Dolphin    Son arrested in missing Boca Raton man’s murder          Things To Do      Add Event +  See More                        More from palmbeachpost.com    Topics         News     Sports     Life                  Sports    When will the nation’s No. 1 overall recruit return to LSU?

In this guide, we'll discuss what scores are needed for you to get admitted into University of Florida. You'll also get to calculate your own chances with our admissions calculator.  Location: Gainesville, FL  This school is also known as: UF   University of Florida Admissions Statistics  There are three critical numbers when considering your admissions chances: ACT scores, GPA, and acceptance rate . All these combine to tell you what you scores are required to get into University of Florida.    Average ACT: 28   The average ACT score composite at University of Florida is a 28 .   The 25th percentile ACT score is 27, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 31.  In other words, a 27 places you below average, while a 31 will move you up to above average. There's no absolute ACT requirement at University of Florida, but they really want to see at least a 27 to have a chance at being considered.

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Average GPA: 3.73   The average GPA at University of Florida is 3.73 . This makes University of Florida Strongly Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
    
    This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.73, University of Florida
      
      requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, with a leaning toward A's. If you took some AP or IB classes, this will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.73, you'll need a higher ACT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 48%   The acceptance rate at University of Florida is 48% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, 48 are admitted.   This means the school is somewhat selective . You should prepare your academic scores well, but you have an excellent chance if you impress them.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring at a 28 ACT or above will already give you a great shot at getting in. Scoring a 31 will nearly guarantee you admission, given that your GPA is roughly the average of 3.73.

Pick your test: ACT    ACT Score      Your GPA       Note: Your admission decision relies not only on your GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but also on your coursework difficulty, extracurriculars, letters of recommendation, and personal statements. This tool provides only a simplistic estimate of your chances of admission. Instead of treating this tool as a crystal ball, we recommend you consider the big picture of what your chance means:  80-100%: Safety school: Strong chance of getting in  50-80%: More likely than not getting in  20-50%: Lower but still good chance of getting in  5-20%: Reach school: Unlikely to get in, but still have a shot  0-5%: Hard reach school: Very difficult to get in  We recommend you apply to schools across a range of chances. Applying to some safety schools will guarantee you have a college to go to, while applying to some reach schools will give you a shot at getting into the school at the top of your range.

This makes University of Florida Strongly Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
    
    This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.71, University of Florida
      
      requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, with a leaning toward A's. If you took some AP or IB classes, this will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.71, you'll need a higher SAT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 48%   The acceptance rate at University of Florida is 48% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, 48 are admitted.   This means the school is somewhat selective . You should prepare your academic scores well, but you have an excellent chance if you impress them.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring at a 1874 SAT or above will already give you a great shot at getting in. Scoring a 2020 will nearly guarantee you admission, given that your GPA is roughly the average of 3.71.

This tool provides only a simplistic estimate of your chances of admission. Instead of treating this tool as a crystal ball, we recommend you consider the big picture of what your chance means:  80-100%: Safety school: Strong chance of getting in  50-80%: More likely than not getting in  20-50%: Lower but still good chance of getting in  5-20%: Reach school: Unlikely to get in, but still have a shot  0-5%: Hard reach school: Very difficult to get in  We recommend you apply to schools across a range of chances. Applying to some safety schools will guarantee you have a college to go to, while applying to some reach schools will give you a shot at getting into the school at the top of your range.

I've seen people on this thread get in with 4.2 GPA's this year, but they all seem to be OOS kids. Someone told me that if you can afford to pay OOS tuition without any financial need, it'll boost your application, but I have no idea how the whole system works. Others told me that UF likes geographical diversity, etc.  They're all still rumors to me, but it's something to keep in mind, I guess.  Also, last year they didn't accept a single student who had below a 3.25-3 GPA, and only about 0.1% of the students they took had around a 3.3-3.5 GPA.

If your school (like mine) only allows you to take AP's in 11th and 12th your GPA will never be this high. Probably should mention UF is aware of rampant GPA inflation and will compare you to your classmates (GPA indicates how competitive you are within your school, ACT/SAT compares you with everyone else).  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     sushipanda    Registered User  Posts: 117  Junior Member      June 2017    edited June 2017        @Jnjrs Idk about the indicator thing within the school. They probably do compare you to your classmates but it doesn't seem like it has much weight. Half of my class has above a 4.5 UF GPA and they've regularly accepted at least 90% of our class each year for the past 10+ years, so even if my school is grade inflated (which it isn't), they still seem to have a preference for these schools.  They accept a lot more kids from schools who offer more APs as opposed to those that don't. Here in Alachua, our 3 main feeder schools allow their kids to take 22+ AP classes and basically everyone gets in, whereas my friend in Miami claims that UF only accepted 7 people from her school. The ACT/SAT thing isn't really used as a big indicator either. I think as long as you're in the top %'s of your class at a school that doesn't offer many APs, you'll be okay, but my guess is that they'd take the kid who has a 4.5 GPA and is Top-50% of his class over the kid with a 4.1 GPA and is Top-25%. Just a guess, though, but the evidence I've observed seems to support it.  On their common data set, UF flagged the SAT as less important than GPA and they even said on their website that they consider coursework and GPA to be the most important factors during admissions.  "Please note that the University of Florida considers classroom performance an excellent indicator of college coursework success, and therefore places more emphasis on grades and the challenge of the high school curriculum (including the senior-year schedule)."  Also, @mpancake UF doesn't consider major during admissions, it's only used for placement. I know that if you choose a PaCE major they know they can put you in PaCE, but that's about all it's used for, I think.   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     Jnjrs    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      June 2017        @sushipanda You make a good point. All i know is that an admissions officer told me they recieve your schools curriculum and judge you based on that. A 4.4 gpa is weighted differently depending on the school you go to, and is considered in conjunction with course rigor. A 4.4 will not be impressive to UF if all you took were easy honor classes. About your school: I do believe thats just a causal relationship. Better schools typically offer more AP's/harder courses, but not all schools that offer more AP's are better schools. Besides, UF's hollistic admissions means its practically impossible to accurately predict admissions based on academics.  PS. Is Harvard good because its Harvard? Or does the student make the institution? I don't believe UF likes a particular school more than another, rather if the students are very (insert what UF wants in 2017 here) the students will be accepted individually based on their own merits and not on school brand name. Your school sounds like one full with motivated students who would probably get accepted to UF regardless of where they attend.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     CaucAsianDad    Registered User  Posts: 616  Member      June 2017       I agree with @Jnjrs  I also think the GCs make a difference.  Some are better at advising, prepping and directing the right applicants to UF admission.  My D's school sends very few students to UF, not because it is not a good school, but I believe it is because the GCs do not advise the students well for UF admissions.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         Sign In or Register to comment.

So I got accepted into FSU, what are the chances of getting in UF in comparison? Do they have the same requirements?  I have pretty low test scores (compared to everyone else - 1250 on the SAT...I'm a bad test taker) but I have a really high GPA. I have a 3.9 unweighted and 4.7 weighted GPA. I'm number one in my class and I've taken 5 AP classes (all the AP classes my school offers) and 12 dual enrollment classes. I'm in a good amount of clubs, including Beta, National Honors Society, Theatre, Great Decisions, Teens for Change, and a few more. I go to a very small school (we only have 700 kids and the grades range from 6th to 12th), so this is 90% of the clubs it offers. However, I've never played any sport. I'm not the athletic type, haha. I believe my essay was pretty good, as well. Writing is my strong suit. I know I don't sound great compared to everyone else on here, but I'm just curious as to what my chances of getting into UF are. Also, I live in Florida, if that is relevant in any way. Thanks in advance!

He's not number one in his class, but he's in the top 8%. 5.4 gpa, 3.92 unweighted. His SATs were only 1250, which is going to hurt his chances.

UF does put more importance's on GPA/Class Rigor, the essay and EC's, than on test scores. For example, 73% of enrolled freshman (2016-2017 CDS info), were in the top 10% of their class, 95% was in the top 25%.   MIDDLE 50% FOR THE CLASS OF 2021: Academic Core GPA: 4.3-4.6 SAT: 1280-1430 ACT: 28-32   Being in the middle 50% is no guarantee of acceptance, but it gives you an idea and a range to shoot for. Remember, about 50% of admissions is based on nonacademic factors.

Fortunately, according to UF's Common Data Set, standardized test scores are considered "important" whereas GPA, class rigor, and essays are considered "very important" ( https://ir.aa.ufl.edu/media/iraaufledu/common-data-set/Main_cds2016-2017.pdf ).  Assuming you're using the same weighted GPA formula that UF uses, your grades are above the mid-range while your SAT scores are  just below ( http://www.admissions.ufl.edu/blog/2017/02/27/admitted-class-profile.html ).  I'd say you have a decent chance, but it's always difficult to guess with holistic admissions.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     idkwhatimdoin    Registered User  Posts: 21  New Member      January 28       Thanks for your input, everyone!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     idkwhatimdoin    Registered User  Posts: 21  New Member      February 9       Update: I got in! :)   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     hammer510    Registered User  Posts: 7  New Member      February 22       Congratulations!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     Parman37    Registered User  Posts: 121  Junior Member      February 23       So happy for you!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         Sign In or Register to comment.

Unweighted GPA: 3.5 UF GPA: 3.94 SAT: 1270 State Of Residence: Florida Male / Female: Female Summer or Fall: Summer Class rank: 16%  AP's: World History, Environmental Science, Human Geography, Psychology, Language and Composition, Computer Science, Calculus, Literature  EC: Girl Scout Gold Award, project was 80+ hours, including creating an elementary school lesson plan on healthy eating and presenting the course to about 200 kids. Also built a website to sustain the project. She spent 10 years in Girl Scouts. She's also in other organizations like NHS and the future educators with another 100+ hours.  Volunteering- More than 350 hours at a university affiliated pre-school for kids with and without special needs.  Volunteered during three consecutive high school summers. Did it on her own with no prodding from her parents.  Awards: numerous for her community service including some high profile honors.  "Hooks": attended a pre-college program at UF (CPET) this past summer - they loved her.  From a family of Gators. Also went on the tour and spent a lot of time on the application.  Is UF first choice? Yes  Other schools applied for: Accepted to UNF, UCF, USF, FGCU. Pending at FSU and UF.  Major/Field of Study: Digital Arts and Sciences in Engineering  Comments: We know ii's a reach. GPA is the big weakness, but grades have improved each year.  She's a monster on meaningful, long-term ECs,and wrote her essay about what she learned from volunteering with kids.

However they're not terrible, and UF likes to see its applicants challenge themselves in their coursework, which your daughter is definitely doing. (A 4.0 in all "regular" courses wouldn't be as impressive, IMO)  Her extracurriculars look super strong, and that IS something that will give her an edge in the applicant pool! (unfortunately being a legacy doesn't seem to count for much these days)  Also the girl scout project sounds really interesting, I hope she had time to touch on that in her essay. (Even if she didn't, hopefully she was able to briefly describe it elsewhere because it really does sound unusual) With a strong essay and a strong extracurrucular interest, I think her chances are pretty good.  Certainly not definite, but a very decent chance.  Fingers crossed for you!  2   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     GatorDad305    Registered User  Posts: 41  Junior Member      November 2017       thanks.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     JDGatorfan    Registered User  Posts: 22  Junior Member      January 7        @Gator88NE , would love your feedback as you seem like the UF goto!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     Gator88NE    Registered User  Posts: 5,838  Senior Member      January 7       Well, I think @Trisherella nailed it. Her GPA and test scores are a bit low, but class rigor and ECs are strong. The essay really matters, especially for your daughter, who's EC's are so strong.  It's really hard to say anything about her chances, other than she does have a chance, with students matching her stats getting into UF. So much depends on her EC's, and essay, which are subjective.  Check out section C of the Common Data set (if you haven't already):   https://ir.aa.ufl.edu/media/iraaufledu/common-data-set/CDS_2017-2018_UFMain_Dec2017.pdf  Keep in mind that 25% of the students admitted to UF have the same or lower test scores and GPA.  Even if not admitted, it's fairly easy (if you have the college grades) to transfer into UF's Digital Arts and Sciences in Engineering program (it's not crazy competitive like Mechanical engineering or finance), so going to UNF or UCF for a year or two (likely with a merit based scholarship to help pay for the cost) and then transferring to UF is not a bad option!

I read the Washington Post article from this week, which you also shared, and one impression it gives is that the holistic admissions is meant to identify students with hardships of one kind or another but not necessarily late bloomers or kids with strong leadership yet borderline numbers.  It was a bit disheartening, to be honest.  thanks again to you and @Trisherella .  In a month, we will know for sure.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     Gator88NE    Registered User  Posts: 5,838  Senior Member      January 8       This holistic stuff is all mystic mumbo jumbo to me. :)  I've gone though waiting till the "2nd Friday in February" with two kids and it's never fun. It does help to have several other acceptances lined up, while you wait...  After listening to AO's on a few campus tours, etc., it's clear that they do value leadership (it's something they called out). In general, what they value is effort and time. They want to say, He/She had these grades while taking these courses and doing this stuff (EC, sports, etc.). That's why they value, something like work, as a plus. The student wasn't setting around all day playing video games and studying for class, they also worked, competed in sports, volunteered, etc. They are more impressed with someone with a 3.5 GPA that worked 20 hours a week, than someone with a 3.7 GPA that didn't.  Overcoming hardships is also highly valued (to what degree? who knows). I think (based on ZERO insider knowledge) it's used as a proxy to make the class more racially and socially (low income students) diversified (in the state of Florida, you can't use race in admissions). About 25% of UF's freshman receive Pell Grants.  On the other hand, I saw that one year about 35% to 40% of UF freshman were legacies..   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     JDGatorfan    Registered User  Posts: 22  Junior Member      February 9       End result: my daughter was offered Gator Engineering at Santa Fe.

I think you're ok.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #8     CORNandTOOTHPICK    -  Posts: 130  Junior Member      January 2013       I think UF GPA is what they consider most. While the range is 4.0 - 4.6, the dead average is 4.38. And for those who know statistics, apparently the modulus rests in 4.38 (meaning instead of people everywhere on the range and that average is 4.38, it is that so many people are dead on 4.38 with few spacing around the range (extrema)).  Normally, I'd say it wouldn't matter, but statistically your drawn back a bit. Still you have a chance.  I've also received my AA before HS, but I've heard dual enrollment isn't all that preferred if you hadn't taken much AP. (Luckily I did). Not sure about 4 APs. Your SAT is a bit below average, but your ACT is acceptable. Good ECs.  I should ask, how well do you think you did on essay and what is your race/ethnicity?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     itsalltina    Registered User  Posts: 20  New Member      January 2013       I'm not exactly sure how my essay turned out but I believe it was somewhat well written. And I'm Hispanic, and come from a low income family if that makes any difference.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     CORNandTOOTHPICK    -  Posts: 130  Junior Member      January 2013       Not sure but I think Hispanics are a minority so that might help. Being poor doesn't help (I'm poor too lol). It does for federal aid. :)   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #11     itsalltina    Registered User  Posts: 20  New Member      January 2013       I'm so nervous lol, thank you for the input!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #12     ilovethe47    -  Posts: 250  Junior Member      January 2013       Since you asked for an opinion I'll provide you mine. Based on my calculations your estimated University of Florida grade-point average is about a 4.1 . Since your grade point average and SAT scores are below average your chances are probably below average. But remember take this with a grain of salt. You will know for sure in a mat..ter of weeks good luck.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #13     Gailbeth7719    Registered User  Posts: 174  Junior Member      January 2013       just to know- my daughter got in last year and had a 3.91 weighted UF gap and a 25 act .  NO APs or dual anything and she is OOS.  Good luck- you never know and she loves it!!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #14     BornToBeaGator    Registered User  Posts: 125  Junior Member      January 2013       CORNANDTOOTHPICK is incorrect. The 25th-75th percentile range of UF GPA is 4.0- 4.4 with the "dead in the middle average" being a 4.2 UF GPA.  Source: University of Florida - Admissions  Also: UF does NOT take race into account. However, if you worked your financial disadvantage into your Essay and how you had to overcome it, that could help you. Your SAT is kind of low...but recalculate your UF GPA for a better "chance."  How to calculate: Only take academic courses, add 1 point to a 4.0 for AP classes, and .5 for Honors classes. An "A" in an AP is worth a 5.0. A "B" in an honors is worth a 3.5.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #15     itsalltina    Registered User  Posts: 20  New Member      January 2013       Again, if it helps, I have over 400 community service hours  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook        « 1 2 »      Go    This discussion has been closed.

Thompson  Palm Beach Post Staff Writer       1:26 p.m Monday, Dec. 16, 2013   Schools & Education                      0                 Like many of her friends and classmates, Chelsea Apparicio couldn’t wait to attend the University of Florida and become a member of Gator Nation.       The recent Suncoast High School grad thought she was a shoo-in. She was enrolled in the school’s International Baccalaureate diploma program. She was an honor society member. She scored 1900 on her SAT. She played varsity soccer since she was a freshman. She logged more than 500 community service hours and served as an ambassador for the school at functions as part of its Mr. and Miss Suncoast program.   “I was really well-rounded,” said Apparicio, 19. “I wasn’t just a book person.”   Florida State University accepted her. So did St. John’s University and the University of Central Florida.   But the University of Florida, Apparicio’s dream school, rejected her — even after she appealed the decision in person with letters of recommendations to the admissions office.   “My mom and I drove up at 4 a.m.,” said Apparicio, who lived in West Palm Beach while in high school. “I thought I deserved to get in and felt like it was a slap in the face.”   Apparicio, now a psychology and business major at FSU, is not alone.       With the Nov. 1 application deadline rapidly approaching, thousands of cream-of-the-crop high school seniors will once again be turned away by UF because competition to get into the state’s oldest school is at an all-time high. In recent years, admissions workers have been forced to choose among some of the brightest and most ambitious students in the state.   “The academic profile of students is getting stronger and stronger every year,” said Dr. Zina Evans, UF’s vice president for enrollment management and associate provost. “When you have more applications, but the same number of seats, then it does become that much more competitive.”   Last year, UF said it received more than 29,000 applications for only 6,400 openings. The university admitted a little over 11,000 students to fill those 6,400 spots. The school has more than 49,000 students for the fall semester.   “A lot of very qualified students simply can’t get in because we don’t have the resources for them,” said Steve Orlando, a UF spokesman. “We have a lot of demand and only limited space.”   Twenty years ago, about 13,000 applicants applied to UF. The school, when competition wasn’t as fierce, admitted a whopping 67 percent, considerably lower than the 43 percent UF accepted for the current fall term.   With the state encouraging dual enrollment, advanced placement courses and IB programs to better prepare high school students for college and beyond, more high achievers are applying to UF, said UF Provost Joseph Glover.   But as support for public colleges and universities dwindles, Glover said, UF, like so many other state universities, is handcuffed.   “We’re simply not in a position to accommodate that many students,” he said.   The university does not have the academic credentials of an Ivy League school, but to many Floridians, UF is the school to attend. The competition to get to Gainesville is becoming more like that at an Ivy League school.   Generations of Floridians, after all, have graduated from UF. Kids often want to attend UF because a parent or grandparent went there.   Clayton Lambert, a freshman aerospace major at UCF, wanted to go to UF for years. His older sister is a UF junior studying business.   “It’s the No. 1 school in the state, in my opinion,” said Lambert, who graduated from Atlantic High School in Delray Beach. “I would’ve felt like I was part of the same group when I was in high school. I would’ve felt right at home there.”   Like Apparicio, the 18-year-old Lambert believed he had the perfect high school resume for UF — swim team captain, cross-country team captain, chess team member, AP courses, IB program graduate.   But Lambert didn’t make the UF cut, either.   “I was heartbroken,” he said. “The year before, almost all the kids in the IB program at Atlantic got into UF and I know I had similar credentials. I thought it was unfair.”   UF, still the only Florida school to belong to the American Association of Universities, has the most rigorous admissions requirements of the state schools and is ranked highest nationally. It placed 17th among public universities and tied for 54th among all national universities in U.S. News & World Report ’s college rankings released last month. Last year, UF ranked 19th among public universities and 58th among all national universities. By turning away more than half of its freshman applicants, UF, some parents say, has developed a reputation of being an elite school.   School faculty, however, sniff at the snooty tag.   “I don’t think we’ve become elitist,” Evans said. “We don’t come into the year and say, ‘Gee, we want to have this academic profile.’ Quite frankly, it’s the students who are pushing this and taking more challenging courses and doing better and better.”   UF’s average freshman profile reads like this: 4.3 GPA, 1958 SAT score, 30 ACT score. According to princetonreview.com, the national average for the SAT is 1500 and 21 for ACT.   By comparison, the average GPA for freshmen entering UCF last fall was 3.8. It was 3.9 at FSU, 3.8 at USF and 3.7 at Florida International University.   But UF said it looks beyond test scores and grades when deciding whom to admit. The school said it’s looking for leaders, students who know how to set themselves apart and are willing to challenge themselves inside — and outside — the classroom.   “If you won your high school science fair, that’s wonderful,” Orlando said. “But if you tell us that you got a patent on something you invented, that’s the kind of thing we’re looking for.”   Evans said applicants should carefully note their high school accomplishments, not just their grades.   “Sometimes students will spend their time telling us that they took this class and got that grade, but we know that already because we have your transcript,” said Evans. “If there was something inspiring that came from the experience that we can’t find elsewhere, tell us that.”   Evans also said the school is turned off by potential students who believe it’s enough to simply list the clubs and organizations they’ve joined.   “We’re much more interested in the breadth and engagement than we are in a laundry list,” Evans said. “Listing 52 things you did for an hour here or there is not nearly as impressive as showing your commitment to a particular project or program. We’re looking at trends over time.”   That’s what Apparicio believes she did on her application. While appealing her decision, she said she was told in the admissions office that UF sets a cap on the number of students it can accept from each high school.   Orlando, however, disputed that claim.   “We don’t set quotas for specific high schools,” he said.   Still, Apparicio said she’s happy at FSU and decided against applying to UF again after her freshman year.   “At first it stunk that I didn’t get into UF,” she said. “But I fell in love with FSU and the psychology program.”   Lambert, who wants to design planes for a living, said he plans to stay at UCF.   “People seem more accepting here,” he said. “I visited UF recently and I was getting a lot of crap from all the kids who go there, saying how much better UF is than UCF. But things are going really well here for me.”   Meanwhile, Evans said she understands the frustration students feel when they’re rejected by their dream university.   “We acknowledge that many other students could do very well here,” she said. “We wish we could offer places for more of them but, unfortunately, we can’t.”                                         View Comments 0                            Most Read     Best Pizza in Every State: The winners are…    2018 NFL Draft: Miami Dolphins Rounds 1-3 Todd McShay Picks | The Daily Dolphin    Son arrested in missing Boca Raton man’s murder          Things To Do      Add Event +  See More                            Weather and Traffic       89  33401                    1                    Most Read     Best Pizza in Every State: The winners are…    2018 NFL Draft: Miami Dolphins Rounds 1-3 Todd McShay Picks | The Daily Dolphin    Son arrested in missing Boca Raton man’s murder          Things To Do      Add Event +  See More                        More from palmbeachpost.com    Topics         News     Sports     Life                  Sports    When will the nation’s No. 1 overall recruit return to LSU?

Nearly all successful applicants have above average grades and standardized test scores. In the graph above, the blue and green dots represent accepted students. The majority of students who got in had an unweighted high school GPA of 3.2 or higher, SAT scores (RW+M) of 1000 or higher, and ACT composite scores over 20. The higher those numbers are, the more likely a student is to be accepted, and admitted students typically have "A" level grades and standardized test scores that are well above average. As you can see in the middle of the graph, there's a lot of red (rejected students) hidden behind the blue and green.

The University of Florida has holistic admissions , so the admissions officers are evaluating students based on more than numerical data. To quote from the UF website : "Admissions is more art than science. The admissions process is designed to consider all aspects of an applicant’s academic record and personal experiences, and is not intended to admit applicants solely on the basis of grade point averages and test scores." In other words, students who show some kind of special talent, unusual background,  or interesting story to tell will often get a close look even if grades and test scores aren't quite up to the ideal. A winning essay and meaningful extracurricular activities can mean the difference between an acceptance and a rejection.

Data courtesy of Cappex.   The graph of rejection data illustrates the reality of holistic admissions at selective universities: some students with excellent grades and standardized test scores do not get admitted. The University of Florida looks for students who excel both inside and outside of the classroom, so strong academics by themselves may not be enough to get in. If it doesn't look like an applicant will contribute to the richness and diversity of the UF campus community in a meaningful way, that student is likely to receive a rejection letter.

It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida that traces its origins to 1853, [7] and has operated continuously on its Gainesville campus since September 1906. [8]  The University of Florida is one of sixty-two elected member institutions of the Association of American Universities (AAU), the association of preeminent North American research universities, and the only AAU member university in Florida. [9] The University is classified as a Research University with Very High Research by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching . [10] After the Florida state legislature's creation of performance standards in 2013, the Florida Board of Governors designated the University of Florida as one of the two "preeminent universities" among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida. [11] [12] For 2018, U.S. News & World Report ranked Florida as the ninth (tied) best public university in the United States. [13]  The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). It is the third largest Florida university by student population , [14] and is the eighth largest single-campus university in the United States with 54,854 students enrolled for the fall 2016 semester. [15] The University of Florida is home to sixteen academic colleges and more than 150 research centers and institutes. It offers multiple graduate professional programs—including business administration , engineering , law , dentistry , medicine , and veterinary medicine —on one contiguous campus, and administers 123 master's degree programs and seventy-six doctoral degree programs in eighty-seven schools and departments. The university's seal is also the seal of the state of Florida which is on the state flag.  The University of Florida's intercollegiate sports teams, commonly known by their " Florida Gators " nickname, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In their 111-year history, the university's varsity sports teams have won 40 national team championships, 35 of which are NCAA titles, and Florida athletes have won 275 individual national championships. [16] In addition, University of Florida students and alumni have won 126 Olympic medals including 60 gold medals .

The University of Florida traces its origins to 1853, when the East Florida Seminary , the oldest of the University of Florida's four predecessor institutions, was founded in Ocala, Florida .  On January 6, 1853, Governor Thomas Brown signed a bill that provided public support for higher education in Florida. [18] Gilbert Kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation, and established the East Florida Seminary , which operated until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. The East Florida Seminary was Florida's first state-supported institution of higher learning. [19]  James Henry Roper, an educator from North Carolina and a state senator from Alachua County , had opened a school in Gainesville, the Gainesville Academy , in 1858. In 1866, [20] Roper offered his land and school to the State of Florida in exchange for the East Florida Seminary's relocation to Gainesville. [21]  The second major precursor to the University of Florida was the Florida Agricultural College , established at Lake City by Jordan Probst in 1884. Florida Agricultural College became the state's first land-grant college under the Morrill Act . In 1903, the Florida Legislature, desiring to expand the school's outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins, changed the name of Florida Agricultural College to the "University of Florida," a name the school would hold for only two years. [22]  "University of the State of Florida" [ edit ]  In 1905, the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act , which consolidated the state's publicly supported higher education institutions. The member of the legislature who wrote the act, Henry Holland Buckman , later became the namesake of Buckman Hall , one of the first buildings constructed on the new university's campus. [23] The Buckman Act organized the State University System of Florida and created the Florida Board of Control to govern the system. It also abolished the six pre-existing state-supported institutions of higher education, and consolidated the assets and academic programs of four of them to form the new " University of the State of Florida ." The four predecessor institutions consolidated to form the new university included the University of Florida at Lake City (formerly Florida Agricultural College) in Lake City , the East Florida Seminary in Gainesville, the St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School in St. Petersburg , and the South Florida Military College in Bartow . [24]  The Buckman Act also consolidated the colleges and schools into three institutions segregated by race and gender—the University of the State of Florida for white men, the Florida Female College for white women, and the State Normal School for Colored Students for African-American men and women. [25]  The City of Gainesville, led by its Mayor William Reuben Thomas , campaigned to be home to the new university. [26] On July 6, 1905, the Board of Control selected Gainesville for the new university campus. Andrew Sledd , president of the pre-existing University of Florida at Lake City , was selected to be the first president of the new University of the State of Florida. The 1905-1906 academic year was a year of transition; the new University of the State of Florida was legally created, but operated on the campus of the old University of Florida in Lake City until the first buildings on the new campus in Gainesville were complete. Architect William A. Edwards designed the first official campus buildings in the Collegiate Gothic style. Classes began on the new Gainesville campus on September 26, 1906, with 102 students enrolled.  In 1909, the school's name was simplified from the "University of the State of Florida" to the "University of Florida."  The alligator was incidentally chosen as the school mascot in 1911, after a local vendor ordered and sold school pennants imprinted with an alligator emblem. The school colors, orange and blue, are a reference to the region's heritage and an homage to the Scottish and Ulster-Scots Presbyterian heritage of the original founders of Gainesville and Alachua County, most of whom were settlers from North Carolina whose ancestors were primarily Presbyterians of Scottish descent who had come to America from County Down and County Antrim in what has become Northern Ireland , while some had come directly from the Scottish Lowlands . [27] [28] [29]  [30]     Statue of Albert Murphree , the second president of the university.    College reorganization [ edit ]  In 1909, Albert Murphree was appointed the university's second president, and organized several of the colleges of the university, increased enrollment from under 200 to over 2,000, and he was instrumental in the founding of the Florida Blue Key leadership society. Murphree is the only University of Florida president honored with a statue on the campus.  In 1924, the Florida Legislature mandated women of a "mature age" (at least twenty-one years old) who had completed sixty semester hours from a "reputable educational institution" would be allowed to enroll during regular semesters at the University of Florida in programs that were unavailable at Florida State College for Women. Before this, only the summer semester was coeducational, to accommodate women teachers who wanted to further their education during the summer break. [31]  Lassie Goodbread-Black from Lake City became the first woman to enroll at the University of Florida, in the College of Agriculture in 1925. [32]  John J. Tigert became the third university president in 1928. Disgusted by the under-the-table payments being made by universities to athletes, Tigert established the grant-in-aid athletic scholarship program in the early 1930s, which was the genesis of the modern athletic scholarship plan used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association . [33]  Post World War II [ edit ]  Beginning in 1946, there was dramatically increased interest among male applicants who wanted to attend the University of Florida, mostly returning World War II veterans who could attend college under the GI Bill of Rights (Servicemen's Readjustment Act). Unable to immediately accommodate this increased demand, the Florida Board of Control opened the Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida on the campus of Florida State College for Women in Tallahassee . [34] By the end of the 1946–47 school year, 954 men were enrolled at the Tallahassee Branch. The following semester, the Florida Legislature returned the Florida State College for Women to coeducational status and renamed it Florida State University . These events also opened up all of the colleges that comprise the University of Florida to female students. African-American students were allowed to enroll starting in 1958. [35]  Shands Hospital opened in 1958 along with the University of Florida College of Medicine to join the established College of Pharmacy . Rapid campus expansion began in the 1950s and continues today. [36]  The University of Florida is one of two Florida public universities, along with Florida State University , to be designated as a "preeminent university" by Florida senate bill 1076, enacted by the Florida legislature and signed into law by the governor in 2013. [37] As a result, the preeminent universities receive additional funding intended to improve the academics and national reputation of higher education within the state of Florida. [38]  National and international prominence [ edit ]     The University of Florida campus in 1916, looking southwest.    In 1985, the University of Florida was invited to join the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization of sixty-two academically prominent public and private research universities in the United States and Canada. Florida is one of the seventeen public, land-grant universities that belong to the AAU. In 2009, President Bernie Machen and the University of Florida Board of Trustees announced a major policy transition for the university. The Board of Trustees supported the reduction in the number of undergraduates and the shift of financial and other academic resources to graduate education and research. [39] In 2017, the University of Florida became the first university in the state of Florida to crack the top ten best public universities according to U.S. News. [40] As of 2016 the University of Florida generated $791.3 Million in Research Expenditures.

The ratio of women to men is 55:45, and 32 percent are graduate and professional students. Professional degree programs include architecture, dentistry, law, medicine, pharmacy and veterinary medicine. Minority populations make up about 36 percent of the student body, with 6.5 percent African-Americans, 21.0 percent Hispanics, 0.5 percent Native American, and 7.9 percent Asian-Americans or Pacific Islanders. [47] According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency , UF has "the largest Jewish student body in the US." [48]  In 2016, the total number of International students attending the university was 5,169. [49]  The University of Florida is ranked second overall in the United States for the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to African-Americans, and third overall for Hispanics. [50] The university ranks fifth in the number of doctoral degrees awarded to African-Americans, and second overall for Hispanics, and third in number of professional degrees awarded to African-Americans, and second overall for Hispanics. [50] The university offers multiple graduate programs—-including engineering, business, law and medicine—-on one contiguous campus, and coordinates 123 master's degree programs and 76 doctoral degree programs in 87 schools and departments.

According to a 2011 study by the university's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences , the university contributed $8.76 billion to Florida's economy and was responsible for over 100,000 jobs in the 2009–10 fiscal year. [106] The Milken Institute named Florida one of the top-five U.S. institutions in the transfer of biotechnology research to the marketplace (2006). [107] Some 50 biotechnology companies have resulted from faculty research programs. Florida consistently ranks among the top 10 universities in licensing. [108] Royalty and licensing income includes the glaucoma drug Trusopt , the sports drink Gatorade , and the Sentricon termite elimination system. The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences is ranked No. 1 by the NSF in Research and Development. [109] Florida ranked seventh among all private and public universities for the number of patents awarded for 2005. [108]  The University of Florida was awarded $791 million in research expenditures in sponsored research in 2016. [110] Research includes diverse areas such as health-care and citrus production (the world's largest citrus research center). In 2002, Florida began leading six other universities under a $15 million NASA grant to work on space-related research during a five-year period. [111] The university's partnership with Spain helped to create the world's largest single-aperture optical telescope in the Canary Islands (the cost was $93 million). [108] Plans are also under way for the University of Florida to construct a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m 2 ) research facility in collaboration with the Burnham Institute for Medical Research that will be in the center of University of Central Florida 's Health Sciences Campus in Orlando, Florida . [112] Research will include diabetes, aging, genetics and cancer.  The University of Florida has made great strides in the space sciences over the last decade. [113] The Astronomy Department's focus on the development of image-detection devices has led to increases in funding, telescope time, and significant scholarly achievements. Faculty members in organic chemistry have made notable discoveries in astrobiology, while faculty members in physics have participated actively in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory project, the largest and most ambitious project ever funded by the NSF. [113] Through the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, the University of Florida is the lead institution on the NASA University Research, Engineering, and Technology Institute (URETI) for Future Space Transport project to develop the next generation space shuttle. [114]  In addition, the university also performs diabetes research in a statewide screening program that has been sponsored by a $10 million grant from the American Diabetes Association . [115] The University of Florida also houses one of the world's leading lightning research teams.

[117]  As of 2012, the University of Florida had more than $750 million in new research facilities recently completed or under construction, including the Nanoscale Research Facility, the Pathogens Research Facility [118] and the Biomedical Sciences Building. [119] [120] Additionally, Innovation Square, a 24/7 live/work/play research environment being developed along Southwest Second Avenue between the University of Florida campus and downtown Gainesville, recently broke ground and plans to open next fall. The university's Office of Technology Licensing will relocate to Innovation Square, joining Florida Innovation Hub, a business "super-incubator designed to promote the development of new high-tech companies based on the university's research programs. Innovation Square will include retail space, restaurants and local businesses, and residential space. [121]  The International Center for Lightning Research and Testing [ edit ]        This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (November 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Florida has more lightning than any other U.S. state. [122] UF sponsors the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT), which occupies over 100 acres (40 ha) at the Camp Blanding Army National Guard Base., [123] about 25 miles (45 km) northeast of UF's campus in Gainesville, Florida. One of their primary research tools is lightning initiation from overhead thunderclouds, using the triggered lightning rocket-and-wire technique. Small sounding rockets, connected to long copper wires, are fired into likely lightning storm cumulonimbus clouds. When the rocket—or its wire—is struck by lightning, the passing of the high-voltage lightning strike down the wire vaporizes it as the lightning travels to the ground. Undergraduate and graduate research in UF's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering's Lightning Research Group is used to increase new fundamental knowledge about lightning-based phenomena.  UF Health [ edit ]  University of Florida Health has two campuses in Gainesville and Jacksonville.

Participation in the Large Hadron Collider [ edit ]  A team of UF physicists has a leading role in one of the two major experiments planned for the Large Hadron Collider , a 17-mile (27 km)-long, $5 billion, super-cooled underground tunnel outside Geneva, Switzerland. [126] More than 30 university physicists, postdoctoral associates, graduate students and now undergraduates are involved in the collider's Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of its two major experiments. About 10 are stationed in Geneva. The group is the largest from any university in the U.S. to participate in the CMS experiment. The UF team designed and oversaw development of a major detector within the CMS. The detector, the Muon system, is intended to capture subatomic particles called muons, which are heavier cousins of electrons. Among other efforts, UF scientists analyzed about 100 of the 400 detector chambers placed within the Muon system to be sure they were functioning properly. Scientists from the University of Florida group played a central role in the discovery of the Higgs particle. The bulk of the UF research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. [127]  Partnership with Zhejiang University [ edit ]  In July 2008, the University of Florida teamed up with the Zhejiang University to research sustainable solutions to the Earth's energy issues. Overall a Joint Research Center of Clean Sustainable Energy among the Florida Institute for Sustainable Energy, at UF, and the State Key Lab of Clean Energy Utilization and the Institute for Thermal Power Engineering, at Zhejiang University will collaborate to work on this pressing issue.

Student affairs rankings [ edit ]  The University of Florida received the following rankings by The Princeton Review in its 2015 Best 380 Colleges Rankings: [157]    Category  Rankings    Lots of Beer  4th overall    Best Alumni Network  14th overall    Party Schools  14th overall    Best College Newspaper  16th overall    Colleges That Pay You Back-Without Aid  16th overall    Lots of Hard Liquor  16th overall    Is that a dorm  18th overall    Best Health Services  20th overall    Top 50 - Colleges That Pay You Back  37th overall    Student government [ edit ]     Seal for the UF Student Government    The University of Florida Student Government is the governing body of students who attend the University of Florida, representing the university's nearly 50,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students. The university's student government operates on a yearly $18.7 million budget, one of the largest student government budgets in the United States, and the money is allocated by the Budget Committee of the Student Senate. [158]  The student government was established in 1909 and consists of executive, judicial and unicameral legislative branches. The executive branch includes the student government president, vice president and treasurer elected by the student body during the spring semester, as well as nine agencies and forty-one cabinet members.  The Student Senate is the legislative branch, and is composed of 100 senators who serve one-year terms. The student body elects fifty senators during each spring semester and the remaining fifty during the fall semester. The senators elect a Senate President and Senate President Pro Tempore twice a year, after each semester's elections, to lead the Student Senate. During student government elections students may also vote on referendums, such as the renewable energy referendum, [159] which was approved by 78% of voting students in the spring of 2007. This referendum proposed a fifty-cents-per-credit-hour increase to student activity fees to fund renewable energy and efficiency on campus.  The student government judicial branch has two major components: the Supreme Court of the Student Body (headed by a Chief Justice) and all elections related officials (the Supervisor of Elections and the Elections Commission). The Supreme Court consists of seven second or third-year law students nominated by the Student Body President and confirmed by the Student Senate. Each justice serves a "life-time" term, which extends through the individual justice's graduation and insulates the court from the politics of student government. The Chief Justice may appoint a marshal and clerk. The election commission is also composed of law students and it adjudicates all student government election complaints. The commission has six members, one of whom also serves as the commission chairman.  The student government executive branch is led by the Student Body President and includes the Student Body Vice President, Student Body Treasurer, twelve agencies, twelve executive secretaries, nineteen cabinet directors, and three cabinet chairs.  Alma mater [ edit ]  The alma mater for the University of Florida was composed by Milton Yeats in 1925. [160]  Campus and area transportation [ edit ]  The university campus is served by nine bus routes of the Gainesville Regional Transit System (RTS). Students, faculty, and staff with university-issued ID cards are able to use the system for no additional fee.

Gators Always.    As Gators, we're motivated by more than winning. It's about answering to a higher calling and playing for a purpose greater than ourselves. It's a difference seen on the field and heard across campus. It's why we've been able to fill stadiums and trophy shelves. It's what happens when you’re more than an individual, more than a team. We're one nation. And when we're united, we're unstoppable.         97     UF student-athletes have earned a total of 97 Academic All-America honors since 1992.         100     UF is the only SEC school to place 100 or more student-athletes on the academic honor roll each of the last 16 years.         33     UF is the only program to finish among the nation’s top 10 in each of the last 33 national all-sports standings.                 The Gator Way  We are committed to building athletes that are dominant on and off the field. As Gators, earning a degree is just as important as winning a title. UF not only leads the SEC, but we score a top-10 national ranking in Academic All-Americans.  Academics           The Office of Student Life  As a showcase to our commitment to academic development, we are renovating our office of student life.

Learn More              The Rowdy Reptiles were recently voted one of the best student fan sections in the NCAA.     C'mon Gators, get up and Go  Winning is just one of our favorite gameday traditions. For 10 years students have lined the sidewalk across from The Swamp the night before every home game for a chance at getting a weekly 'Beat' T-shirt. Two and a half hours prior to each home game, fans gather at the north end of the stadium to welcome the players into The Swamp. Welcome to The Gator Nation.
