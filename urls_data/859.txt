Dying in Your Sleep: More Common Than You Think Published on March 11, 2017 Bryan Lorden Follow Following Unfollow Bryan Lorden Sign in to follow this author Regional Sales Manager 1 in 4 people die of heart disease (American Heart Association) and 1 in 8 will die in their sleep (answers.com). Sleep apnea is also one of the top causes that leads to dying in your sleep, affecting 42 million Americans.  How likely are you to die in your sleep? If estimates like the ones above are correct, that's over 10% of the US population meeting their fates between dreams! Most of these deaths are attributed to heart attack or cardiac arrest, and it is believed that many thousands of people actually die because they had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  Now again, these are rough statistics. However, even if we estimate low on the severity of this situation, it's clear that individuals suffering from sleep apnea or other health concerns have reasons to be concerned about their safety while they sleep. One would assume that as the technology industry grows, there would be more and more focus on the development of affordable, easy to use devices to make sleeping safer. The truth is, however, that many individuals suffering from these kind of health conditions still only have bulky, uncomfortable, expensive machines to keep them safe. Due to financial limitations, many of these individuals go without any safety net at all.  One company understood a similar disconnect between safety and independent living in senior citizens and developed LifeAlert, a device that could be worn around the neck with a button to press in the event of an emergency. But what does a person with a heart condition or sleep apnea do if their heart stops beating during their sleep?  Dying in your sleep is all too common. The answer now is Zoi, a wearable device that integrates currently with Apple Watches and soon FitBits and other wearable devices capable of detecting heart rate. Do you have sleep apnea? Zoi will make recommendations based on your sleep patterns.  Zoi was developed by Bryan Lorden after he lost a friend to sleep apnea in September of 2015. The goal was to develop an application that could be used to help save lives in the event of an emergency during sleep. Zoi utilizes the technology in wearable devices to monitor the heart for irregularities. In the event Zoi detects a severe abnormality, it will alert the user, loved ones and 911.  It's hard to say why exactly it has taken so long for such an application to be developed, but Bryan Lorden and team are proud to finally present Zoi, the app that can save a life, to the general public.

The National Safety Council has calculated the probability of dying from a variety of causes in this interesting graphic. The largest box is the odds of dying from any cause: 100% (because we're all going to kick the bucket some day). The two least probable events have the smallest boxes at the bottom: dying from a cataclysmic storm or from lightning (1 in 126,158). It's worth noting that these lifetime odds of dying are statistical averages over the entire US population and don't predict your or any other individual's odds of dying from a particular cause. Still, it might be comforting to know fewer people die from amusement park rides than from just walking around as pedestrians. (Roller coasters aren't on this list, but Consumerist reports numbers from the Consumer Product Safety Commission: in 2011, of the 1.7 billion rides taken, only 1,177 people were admitted to a hospital or died from one of them.)

Home  About        Dying In Your Sleep   31  Jul      Dying in your sleep is greatly overrated.  However, if you came here from google, don’t feel alone: my research tells me that almost 4,000 people a year google the topic.  My hunch is that’s 2,000 people genuinely anxious about the subject for some reason or another, mostly unfounded, and the rest is split between people with sleep apnea, kids writing English papers, and people with macabre interests.  Or maybe not. Either way, let’s see what we can figure out about this idea of dying in your sleep .  “I would’ve died and never even knew it.” – Guy who spent a couple of days asleep after a head accident, recovering. He almost died. Isn’t it weird to think you would die and not even know it was coming if you randomly died in your sleep? And therein lies the fear we have about dying while asleep.  Fun With Statistics  In order to give us some contrast to how people die and how many people die in various ways, let’s look at some stats. These are based on 2009 USA number, the last year of which the data is available.   Almost 2.5 million people die each year in the United States  About half a million of those deaths are from heart disease  Another half a million are from malignant neoplasms, or, to put it in words that people actually use – cancer.  People being killed by other people only accounts for 16,000 deaths.  Amazingly, people being killed by themselves on purpose – i.e. suicide –  account for 36,000 deaths, more than double the murder rate. (How could that be true?)  Over 100,000 people die a year from accidents.   Unfortunately for our purposes here, even though the report is 51 pages and all about how people die, the word “sleep” isn’t even mentioned once.  Not To Be Overly Sensationalistic, But Here’s a List of Some Things That Can Kill You in Your Sleep:  People do die in their sleep, but it’s not without cause, such as:   Blood Clots  Heart Attacks  Sleep Apnea  Stroke  Drug Overdose   I would suspect the vast majority of people who die while sleeping were sick, elderly, and in a fragile state of life already. For the non-elderly though, I imagine that heart attacks lead the list as to what kills them. Of course, sleep apnea is a big concern but it’s rare, for one thing, and most people with it take action to keep themselves safe using a cpap machine while sleeping.  What about Sleep Apnea?  Here’s the thing:  If you don’t have sleep apnea and you are a normal, healthy adult, I don’t think there’s any reason at all to obsess over dying in your sleep.  If you really worry about it, please see a doctor and have your concerns checked out. If you know it’s really just anxiety then perhaps it’s worth exploring this anxiety with a therapist.    Should I Worry?  No! You should not worry. Chances are if you googled this topic you are young and if you are young – as in under age 60 – I don’t think there’s any reason to imagine you are just going to suddenly go to sleep and not wake up. If you are worried about your health, you should see a doctor and get it settled, but in my experience, this is anxiety talking, and nothing more.  I also think that it’s true what they say: dying in your sleep is very peaceful.  What’s Your Worry?  Why do you worry about might die in your sleep?  Tell us below.

I am here because it is more than anxiety.. Last year I have a grandma who died while sleeping.. It was tragic for us.. and now this year.. exactly March 30.. just a while ago… our beloved batch mate  just died while asleep.. He was in our school for 2 years and then he transferred school.. but he was really in touch with our batch even after he transferred.. Im not sure of his age but probably he is around 16 or 17.. All of us can’t believe of what just happened.. He is a guy who does not uses drugs.. he is actually a youth for Christ member… the only bad thing that I can think he’s been doing is his love of playing warcraft.. He always go to our school twice or thrice a year.. Now I m just wondering.. from what I read in your blog.. the best reason could be Sleep Apnea.. but just like what you said.. it is rare… and what could actually be the reason for a healthy guy to die because of sleep apnea? I know you could not exactly answer these.. but I just want to hear your thoughts.. Thank you very much.. sorry to bother you.. excuse my english because I’m actually an Asian,,            Bob  August 31, 2016 at 6:48 am   #     You must be very young, author Ben. Dying in your sleep is generally considered to be a good thing, typically, not something to fear. Painless, and oblivious, at home.                Leave a Reply   Click here to cancel reply.

The site, DeathRiskRankings.com , is the brainchild of researchers and students at Carnegie Mellon University. It provides answers based on publicly available data from the United States and Europe, comparing mortality risks by gender, age, cause of death and geographic region. Put your info in, and it produces the probable causes of your demise and provides insight on the timing of that unfortunate event.  The site can compare such things as the odds of death next year by breast cancer for, say, a 54-year-old Pennsylvania woman or her counterpart in the United Kingdom.  Of course the results produced by the web site speak to groups of people and cannot predict with accuracy when you might actually kick the bucket . The timing of your own end is based on many uncharted factors, from heredity to lifestyle to untimely accidents.  But noodling around with the interface can be enlightening, if not frightening.  "It turns out that the British woman has a 33 percent higher risk of breast cancer death. But for lung/throat cancer, the results are almost reversed, and the Pennsylvania woman has a 29 percent higher risk," explained Paul Fischbeck, site developer and professor of social and decision sciences and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.  "Most Americans don't have a particularly good understanding of their own mortality risks , let alone ranking of their relevant risks," said David Gerard, a former professor at Carnegie Mellon who is now an associate professor of economics at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.  The researchers found that beyond infancy, the risk of dying increases annually at an exponential rate.  A 20-year-old U.S. woman has a 1 in 2,000 (or 0.05 percent) chance of dying in the next year, for example. By age 40, the risk is three times greater; by age 60, it is 16 times greater; and by age 80, it is 100 times greater (around 1 in 20 or 5 percent).  "The risks are higher, but still not that bad," Gerard said. "At 80, the average U.S. woman still has a 95 percent chance of making it to her 81st birthday."  Other results for queries about dying within the year:  For every age group, men have a much higher annual death risk than women. For 20-year-olds, the risk is 2.5 to three times greater for men. Men are much more prone to accidents, homicides and suicides, and the risk of dying from heart disease is always higher for men than women, peaking in the 50s when men are 2.5 times at greater risk of dying.  Women's cancer risks are higher than men's in their 30s and 40s.  For heart disease and cancer, U.S. blacks have a much higher death risk than U.S. whites. Overall, blacks in their 30s and 40s are twice as likely to die within the year as their white counterparts. Only for suicides, do whites consistently exceed blacks, where whites typically have two to three times greater chances of dying.  For 20-year-old males, 80 percent of their death risks are from accidents, homicides and suicides. By age 50, however, these causes make up less than 10 percent and heart disease is No. 1, accounting for more than 30 percent of all deaths.   Obesity-related death risks are much higher in the United States than in Europe. For example, the annual diabetes death risk in the United States is three times that found in northern Europe for 60 year olds.  Fischbeck and Gerard hope the site will add information to the U.S. healtchcare debate .  "We believe that this tool, which allows anyone to assess their own risk of dying and to compare their risks with counterparts in the United States and Europe, could help inform the public and constructively engage them in the debate," Fischbeck said.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

They formed a close bond and shared a flat for six months in Sydney before both heading back to the UK. Over the years the two kept in touch, despite marrying and having three children each. But one day Laura Berrill received the shocking news that Sarah Didinal had died in her sleep - at the age of just 37. Instant rapport "We clicked straight away, and it was amazing how two strangers, randomly meeting on the other side of the world, could create a close friendship so quickly, which would last right until her untimely death only 12 years later at the age of 37," Laura said.     "A few weeks after meeting, we both had enough money to get a tiny flat to share just around the corner from the beach. It was so much fun and probably one of the best times of my life. We worked hard, partied hard and laughed hard for six months" Laura, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, says she can never come to terms with losing Sarah so unexpectedly, from a condition she had never heard of - myocarditis. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart's muscle and is usually caused by a viral infection. Now Laura is trying to draw attention to the fact that young and seemingly healthy people, like Sarah, can be at risk. Every day in Britain, one person aged under 35 dies from a sudden death. Myocarditis, which Sarah had, can cause a cardiac arrhythmia.  I know she did not suffer but it is just so sad Laura Berrill   "There were no symptoms, nothing, she was perfectly healthy," said Laura. "She did not smoke, but she never stood a chance. She had had a bit of a cold and a sore throat and that was it. She went to bed and didn't wake up. "I know she did not suffer but it is just so sad. It is very difficult to comprehend." Risk warnings "I think about her every day and it hit me so hard - but what about her husband Andy, her parents and her three kids - Luke, Tom, Cameron - all under 11? "There was no other real sense to be made out of her death, and for the desperate loss felt by her family and friends.  Warning signs   A family history of unexpected, unexplained sudden death of an apparently healthy person  Fainting (syncope) or seizure during physical activity, emotional excitement, being distressed or startled or on arousal from sleep  Consistent or unusual chest pain and/or abnormal shortness of breath during exercise   "It should never have been Sarah as she loved life so much and had so much to live for. And so much more to give. "Sarah died in her sleep after having a lovely day - her last tweet said: 'Going to bed happy'. "That broke my heart in an instant because it so truly summed up what Sarah was all about. "I can't help but feel it was so wrong and I wish to this day there might have been something that could have stopped it, even though I know there wasn't." In the year since her friend died, Laura has tried to alert people to SADS, including doing a fun-run to raise awareness. "I knew nothing about it before. I just want people to know." Anne Jolly from SADS UK said that because of their suddenness, deaths like Sarah's, that of footballer Marc Vivien Foe and - most recently - Stephen Gately from Boyzone, left families bewildered. But she said there were signs that could alert people to their risk. "The charity especially highlights the fact that young people can suffer from cardiac conditions," she said. "SADS UK has urged [the] government to introduce cardiac assessment at the GP surgery, [and] to question family and personal medical history, to identify people at risk of SADS," she said. "Awareness and understanding are fundamental in preventing loss of further life, both within the same family and other families as yet unaffected.

I hope you've got someone you can talk to about your problems. Both depression and hypochondria are things you could use some professional help with. Do consider talking to your parents (if you still live at home) or your boyfriend/girlfriend, or finding a psychologist to talk to on your own. To answer your main question, the odds of getting a brain tumour are about 8 in 100,000. The odds of dying from it are smaller than that. The odds of dying from it with *NO* warning symptoms are even smaller. A small lump on your head is *not* a symptom of a brain tumour. A brain tumour would not make a lump on your head like you're imagining, nor could it push through the skull. And if you've been having these migraines on and off for more than a few months, they're most likely *not* tumour-induced headaches. I've put some links below that might help you. You might like to consider seeing your GP and getting a referral to a psychologist, or maybe some information on anti-depressive and anti-anxiety medication. Hypochondria affects about 5% of the US population.

Everyone alive has a less than 50 percent chance of dying while asleep because everyone sleeps less than half of their lifetime.  One increases those odds by ignoring the warning signs of illness, especially of heart attack, stroke and sleep apnea.  Ongoing reliance on sleeping pills when one has no illnesses is unnecessary.  I  sincerely advise  you to determine the exact cause or causes of your insomnia and work to get rid of the underlying cause of your sleeplessness by changing your environment, your behavior related to your discomfort and/or your thought patterns around bed time rather than taking sleeping pills.

Without Ever Waking?  October 25, 2004 7:50 AM   Subscribe  Can people actually die in their sleep, without first waking up with the pain or surprise of the sudden crisis that lead to their death?  What are the chances? [ More inside. ]   I'm aware that died in his/her sleep is often a euphemism but is it always so?  Imagine a fully conscious human being, not drugged beyond a sleeping pill or two.  Is it possible to go to sleep and die without waking up?  My totally ignorant and unmedical hunch is that whatever kills you is important enough to jolt you into wakefulness,  if only for a moment.  Many thanks for any informed advise or less scientifically unsupported opinions.  posted by MiguelCardoso to Science & Nature (23 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite           I have anecdotal evidence only. When my great-grandmother died in her sleep at the age of 95, my great aunt went in to wake her up and only discovered that she had died when she went to nudge her to wake her up. My feeling is that if there was some sort of shock of impending death, my great grandmother would have had some sort of "oh hell, this is it!" look on her face and not have appeared to be peacefully sleeping. posted by jessamyn at 7:59 AM on October 25, 2004  When I had my heart attack last year, I slept through the first four hours of it. I know this because when it first started, I mistook it for a cold coming on, and I took a nap. When I woke up, the pain had steadily grown so intense that 12 units of morphine couldn't touch it.  YMMV. ;-P posted by mischief at 8:01 AM on October 25, 2004  I'm sure it happens all the time. One of my best frients died in his sleep of a blood clot a few years ago. His wife slept on next to him, and was unaware until rising the next morning (I can think of few things more horrible). The only consolation is that the doctors told us that it was probably quick---his brain stopped receiving oxygen and he simply faded in his sleep, probably without pain. Were they telling us what we wanted to hear? I don't know. posted by bonehead at 8:03 AM on October 25, 2004  Imagine a fully conscious human being If you're close to death, chances are you may not be a fully conscious human being. There's no reason something has to "kill" you for you to die... sometimes you just stop living. posted by 4easypayments at 8:03 AM on October 25, 2004  Unfortunately the people with the best answers are dead. posted by smackfu at 8:03 AM on October 25, 2004  Miguel--you're assuming that most of your body is well-innervated with nerves; most organs are not. Most organs are lined only with a layer of connective tissue (visceral) that is not well innervated; you only get localized, stronger pain when the outer layer (parietal) is disrupted.  If you took out a chunk from the middle of most organs, not disrupting the surface, I don't think you'd be able to tell. posted by gramcracker at 8:10 AM on October 25, 2004 [ 1 favorite ]  Aside from the heart attack/blood clot stuff people have described, if you're very old, you often die in your sleep due to your body just "winding down". Sleep is inherently a state of lessened body activity- if you are already frail, your body may lack the strength to "wake back up" and just continue its descent.  Personally, I knew a guy who this happened to, out of the blue. He was a hardcore party guy, just shy of 30, and he died unexpectedly in his sleep- his body just decided to punt. posted by mkultra at 8:45 AM on October 25, 2004  I cracked my head badly enough to leave me unconscious for several minutes, and then passed in and out of consciousness during the next couple hours during the ambulance ride and hospital admittance.  I then slept very, very heavily the next few days while in a private IC room and a gawdawful IV drip of purest bone-chilling antibiotic poisons.  I could have kicked the bucket at most any time and I'd never, ever have realized it.  It was greatly reassuring: death isn't necessarily a fearful thing.  It can be completely... natural, I suppose.  Graceful, perhaps.  I conclude that one's brain kicks into a nice self-protection mode, in which it lets you die without undue mental stress. posted by five fresh fish at 9:06 AM on October 25, 2004  My 40-something neighbor died this way.  His wife woke up the next morning and found he had died sometime in the night.  She was lying next to him, so you would think if he was in any distress, she would have noticed.  There was no prior medical history.  The writer Shirley Jackson also died this way, a heart attack in her sleep at age 48.  If I remember right, I think she was taking a nap. posted by Secret Life of Gravy at 9:29 AM on October 25, 2004  I conclude that one's brain kicks into a nice self-protection mode, in which it lets you die without undue mental stress.  I'm not convinced, when you're ill sometimes you can go out catastrophically but other times it seems to me more like your body is trying to hang on but has diminishing resources to do so and systems gradually fade out, until eventually it packs in. You can still have a final rapid drop off but by that stage you're too gone to really be around for it anymore.  My mother also spent a fair bit of time in hospitals overnight and it was pretty frequent that old ladies would slip away in the night without anyone in the ward being disturbed. I would venture to say that some where 'natural' deaths but that some where chemically assisted. posted by biffa at 9:59 AM on October 25, 2004  My 80-something grandmother was found dead in exactly the same position she fell asleep. Her heart failed.  I see exactly where you're coming from with this question, but I think you're ignoring one thing: that moment of wakefulness, that "oh shit, I'm dying!" reaction would be an alert self-preservation response from a working body. An aged or ill person whose body finally gives out may or may not have the strength of body or quickness of nerve to wake up for that final gasp. If they did, they might not die at all.  I think some people really do slip away. posted by scarabic at 9:59 AM on October 25, 2004  My wife and I both promised each other that neither of us would die while asleep, just because of how inconsiderate it would be for the one who wakes up. posted by jasper411 at 10:12 AM on October 25, 2004  I had a stroke in my sleep when I was 28. I did eventually wake up, but there was no "Oh shit!" moment. It didn't even really hurt. I was mostly confused. I knew something was horribly wrong but I wasn't sure just what was going on. The people looking at me were more frightened than I was. I could definitely have slept through the whole thing. posted by astruc at 10:37 AM on October 25, 2004  Given that our brains can do some pretty creative things with external and internal phenomena while we sleep (I'm sure most people have experienced things like incorporating the alarm's beeping into a dream so they don't wake up, or dreaming that your arm falls off, only to wake up lying on it), I expect even if people do perceive whatever it is that's killing them in their sleep (assuming it's something catastrophic like a stroke, clot or sudden heart attack and not something more gradual like stopping breathing and subsequent anoxia, which seems unlikely to be perceived), it could well not be perceived as what it actually is.  I read an account of someone who almost died from a heroin overdose, and one of the things that really stuck with me was that they were aware enough to know that they weren't breathing, but didn't care enough to do anything about it (from the euphoria) - perhaps dying in your sleep is something like that.  Either way, people do seem to die while sleeping without waking up during the process. posted by biscotti at 10:57 AM on October 25, 2004  my grandma too, like scarabic. I think it's very common --your heart stops, or a blood clot bursts or something, and you just go. posted by amberglow at 12:01 PM on October 25, 2004  On a slightly related note, my dad had a tree fall on his head a few years ago.  It knocked him out cold, and when he came to a while later, he had to piece together what had happened from the evidence surrounding him: tree, broken hard-hat, headache.  Whenever he tells the story of "the time a tree fell on my head and knocked me out" he always finishes up by saying that he had always thought that the moment before something like that happens you might realize it and panic, but in his experience there was no "oh shit, I'm about to die!" moment, just lights on. lights off. The end.  Sort of comforting, really. posted by bonheur at 6:28 PM on October 25, 2004 [ 2 favorites ]  I read once that someone who gets shot in the head feels no more than slight tap. I have no way of verifying this however.  On a related note, is a death spasm more intense for a violent death than for a peaceful death? posted by mischief at 7:17 PM on October 25, 2004  I have seen people who died and didn't look like they had woken up from sleep.  I was with an aunt of mine during her last waking hours, when she was delirious but seemingly aware that she was dying--after a couple of hours, they gave her some medication that sent her to sleep and sent us home, and according to the nursing home staff she just "never woke up".  Her expression was certainly that of someone who was sleeping.  You might think that it's scary to be with someone who's dying, and it is, but on the other hand it's pretty easy to figure out what to do--you hold their hand and tell them you love them over and over.  And pray, if that's something they do.  Now I am a little sad thinking of this. posted by Sidhedevil at 10:03 PM on October 25, 2004  My grandmother "died in her sleep" last year. Upon taking her final breath, she was surrounded by her surviving sister, her surviving children (my father, two uncles and two aunts), one of her grandchildren (me) and my uncle's partner. Just along the hall was my partner with her yet-to-be-born great-grandchild and a priest from her parish.  She had been deteriorating for a long time. Dementia takes its time and whereas at the start of the last decade it crept slowly into her life and manifested itself mildly, it soon gathered pace and had accelerated at terrifying speed about a month before her death.  A week before she passed away, she had a massive stroke. She was taken to hospital and given a private room on an NHS ward. In the UK, this is a pretty sure sign that death is imminent, so two days later and with no change to her condition, the call went out for family to gather.  An aunt set off to the UK from Australia, an uncle from Spain and other close relatives from across the UK made their way to Yorkshire. I commuted over the Pennines a couple of times before camping out at a family friend's in York.  We kept a vigil over the course of three days. A member of her family was with her at all times. My aunt arrived from Australia and got to the hospital. My father, my partner and I were milling around outside talking to her when I got a call on my mobile to say that my grandmother's breathing was becoming more laboured. Not 5 minutes after her arrival from the other side of the planet, we made our way to the ward.  We entered the room together. There were eight of us gathered around. My grandmother's breathing was very ragged, her skin taught and pale. Hair that since time immemorial had crowned her head in regimented sweeps lay bedraggled on her shoulder.  My aunt removed the oxygen mask from my grandmother's face and held her left hand. My Uncle held her right. We all held hands in a semi circle in between them. We each prayed for her in our own way.  Her breathing continued in a laboured fashion for a few minutes. Without warning, my grandmother's eyes flashed open. With what seemed like remarkable clarity in her eyes, she surveyed the room. She squeezed her children’s hands.  She took a sharp intake of breath, closed her eyes and let out a cry.  It is very difficult to describe that moment. A full and complex range of emotions were expressed in no more than a matter of seconds. At first, she looked so terribly pained at the effort of living. Suddenly, the grimace evaporated in an expression of shock and her cry was cut short, as if caught in her throat.  After a moment, she let go.  With an unending sigh, a look of serene calmness spread through her. Her grip relaxed and her hands fell limp.  Had she been asleep? Had she been awake? Was she "conscious", was she "unconscious"?  I don't and can't know. posted by davehat at 6:48 AM on October 26, 2004  My mother died while awake and playing cards with my father.  She'd always had a bad heart, and it finally just gave out.  Dad said she suddenly leaned over onto the bed she'd been sitting on, still with a smile on her face.  She obviously had no "this is it" awareness; she just... went.  If that's possible when you're awake, it's obviously possible while you're asleep. posted by languagehat at 8:02 AM on October 26, 2004 [ 2 favorites ]  davehat: thank you. posted by iffley at 2:31 PM on October 26, 2004  You can certainly die in your sleep even if your brain is fully operational at the time.  Many of my patients who have died in their sleep told me they felt no -- er, wait a minute.  Seriously: I have seen lots of people die in a very calm, peaceful state, but they were not otherwise healthy - they were dying, in a hospital.  The experience of death remains a mystery to us; no one comes back to explain it.  However, people have died in various stages of sleep with EEGs and polysomnograms on; they do not always revert to a waking state.  The 13 year old girl who died of acute blood loss after a car accident, surrounded by her JW relatives, seemed to me to go very peacefully. posted by ikkyu2 at 4:13 PM on October 26, 2004  My first stepfather died in his sleep, of a massive heart attack. He looked absolutely peaceful and normal when my mother tried to wake him the next morning.

Dying in Your Sleep: More Common Than You Think Published on March 11, 2017 Bryan Lorden Follow Following Unfollow Bryan Lorden Sign in to follow this author Regional Sales Manager 1 in 4 people die of heart disease (American Heart Association) and 1 in 8 will die in their sleep (answers.com). Sleep apnea is also one of the top causes that leads to dying in your sleep, affecting 42 million Americans.  How likely are you to die in your sleep? If estimates like the ones above are correct, that's over 10% of the US population meeting their fates between dreams! Most of these deaths are attributed to heart attack or cardiac arrest, and it is believed that many thousands of people actually die because they had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  Now again, these are rough statistics. However, even if we estimate low on the severity of this situation, it's clear that individuals suffering from sleep apnea or other health concerns have reasons to be concerned about their safety while they sleep. One would assume that as the technology industry grows, there would be more and more focus on the development of affordable, easy to use devices to make sleeping safer. The truth is, however, that many individuals suffering from these kind of health conditions still only have bulky, uncomfortable, expensive machines to keep them safe. Due to financial limitations, many of these individuals go without any safety net at all.  One company understood a similar disconnect between safety and independent living in senior citizens and developed LifeAlert, a device that could be worn around the neck with a button to press in the event of an emergency. But what does a person with a heart condition or sleep apnea do if their heart stops beating during their sleep?  Dying in your sleep is all too common. The answer now is Zoi, a wearable device that integrates currently with Apple Watches and soon FitBits and other wearable devices capable of detecting heart rate. Do you have sleep apnea? Zoi will make recommendations based on your sleep patterns.  Zoi was developed by Bryan Lorden after he lost a friend to sleep apnea in September of 2015. The goal was to develop an application that could be used to help save lives in the event of an emergency during sleep. Zoi utilizes the technology in wearable devices to monitor the heart for irregularities. In the event Zoi detects a severe abnormality, it will alert the user, loved ones and 911.  It's hard to say why exactly it has taken so long for such an application to be developed, but Bryan Lorden and team are proud to finally present Zoi, the app that can save a life, to the general public.  Zoi launches this month at the low cost of $4.99/month.

The National Safety Council has calculated the probability of dying from a variety of causes in this interesting graphic. The largest box is the odds of dying from any cause: 100% (because we're all going to kick the bucket some day). The two least probable events have the smallest boxes at the bottom: dying from a cataclysmic storm or from lightning (1 in 126,158). It's worth noting that these lifetime odds of dying are statistical averages over the entire US population and don't predict your or any other individual's odds of dying from a particular cause. Still, it might be comforting to know fewer people die from amusement park rides than from just walking around as pedestrians. (Roller coasters aren't on this list, but Consumerist reports numbers from the Consumer Product Safety Commission: in 2011, of the 1.7 billion rides taken, only 1,177 people were admitted to a hospital or died from one of them.)

Dying in Your Sleep: More Common Than You Think Published on March 11, 2017 Bryan Lorden Follow Following Unfollow Bryan Lorden Sign in to follow this author Regional Sales Manager 1 in 4 people die of heart disease (American Heart Association) and 1 in 8 will die in their sleep (answers.com). Sleep apnea is also one of the top causes that leads to dying in your sleep, affecting 42 million Americans.  How likely are you to die in your sleep? If estimates like the ones above are correct, that's over 10% of the US population meeting their fates between dreams! Most of these deaths are attributed to heart attack or cardiac arrest, and it is believed that many thousands of people actually die because they had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  Now again, these are rough statistics. However, even if we estimate low on the severity of this situation, it's clear that individuals suffering from sleep apnea or other health concerns have reasons to be concerned about their safety while they sleep. One would assume that as the technology industry grows, there would be more and more focus on the development of affordable, easy to use devices to make sleeping safer. The truth is, however, that many individuals suffering from these kind of health conditions still only have bulky, uncomfortable, expensive machines to keep them safe. Due to financial limitations, many of these individuals go without any safety net at all.  One company understood a similar disconnect between safety and independent living in senior citizens and developed LifeAlert, a device that could be worn around the neck with a button to press in the event of an emergency. But what does a person with a heart condition or sleep apnea do if their heart stops beating during their sleep?  Dying in your sleep is all too common. The answer now is Zoi, a wearable device that integrates currently with Apple Watches and soon FitBits and other wearable devices capable of detecting heart rate. Do you have sleep apnea? Zoi will make recommendations based on your sleep patterns.  Zoi was developed by Bryan Lorden after he lost a friend to sleep apnea in September of 2015.

Home  About        Dying In Your Sleep   31  Jul      Dying in your sleep is greatly overrated.  However, if you came here from google, don’t feel alone: my research tells me that almost 4,000 people a year google the topic.  My hunch is that’s 2,000 people genuinely anxious about the subject for some reason or another, mostly unfounded, and the rest is split between people with sleep apnea, kids writing English papers, and people with macabre interests.  Or maybe not. Either way, let’s see what we can figure out about this idea of dying in your sleep .  “I would’ve died and never even knew it.” – Guy who spent a couple of days asleep after a head accident, recovering. He almost died. Isn’t it weird to think you would die and not even know it was coming if you randomly died in your sleep? And therein lies the fear we have about dying while asleep.  Fun With Statistics  In order to give us some contrast to how people die and how many people die in various ways, let’s look at some stats. These are based on 2009 USA number, the last year of which the data is available.   Almost 2.5 million people die each year in the United States  About half a million of those deaths are from heart disease  Another half a million are from malignant neoplasms, or, to put it in words that people actually use – cancer.  People being killed by other people only accounts for 16,000 deaths.  Amazingly, people being killed by themselves on purpose – i.e. suicide –  account for 36,000 deaths, more than double the murder rate. (How could that be true?)  Over 100,000 people die a year from accidents.   Unfortunately for our purposes here, even though the report is 51 pages and all about how people die, the word “sleep” isn’t even mentioned once.  Not To Be Overly Sensationalistic, But Here’s a List of Some Things That Can Kill You in Your Sleep:  People do die in their sleep, but it’s not without cause, such as:   Blood Clots  Heart Attacks  Sleep Apnea  Stroke  Drug Overdose   I would suspect the vast majority of people who die while sleeping were sick, elderly, and in a fragile state of life already. For the non-elderly though, I imagine that heart attacks lead the list as to what kills them. Of course, sleep apnea is a big concern but it’s rare, for one thing, and most people with it take action to keep themselves safe using a cpap machine while sleeping.  What about Sleep Apnea?  Here’s the thing:  If you don’t have sleep apnea and you are a normal, healthy adult, I don’t think there’s any reason at all to obsess over dying in your sleep.  If you really worry about it, please see a doctor and have your concerns checked out. If you know it’s really just anxiety then perhaps it’s worth exploring this anxiety with a therapist.    Should I Worry?  No! You should not worry. Chances are if you googled this topic you are young and if you are young – as in under age 60 – I don’t think there’s any reason to imagine you are just going to suddenly go to sleep and not wake up. If you are worried about your health, you should see a doctor and get it settled, but in my experience, this is anxiety talking, and nothing more.  I also think that it’s true what they say: dying in your sleep is very peaceful.  What’s Your Worry?  Why do you worry about might die in your sleep?  Tell us below.

I am here because it is more than anxiety.. Last year I have a grandma who died while sleeping.. It was tragic for us.. and now this year.. exactly March 30.. just a while ago… our beloved batch mate  just died while asleep.. He was in our school for 2 years and then he transferred school.. but he was really in touch with our batch even after he transferred.. Im not sure of his age but probably he is around 16 or 17.. All of us can’t believe of what just happened.. He is a guy who does not uses drugs.. he is actually a youth for Christ member… the only bad thing that I can think he’s been doing is his love of playing warcraft.. He always go to our school twice or thrice a year.. Now I m just wondering.. from what I read in your blog.. the best reason could be Sleep Apnea.. but just like what you said.. it is rare… and what could actually be the reason for a healthy guy to die because of sleep apnea? I know you could not exactly answer these.. but I just want to hear your thoughts.. Thank you very much.. sorry to bother you.. excuse my english because I’m actually an Asian,,            Bob  August 31, 2016 at 6:48 am   #     You must be very young, author Ben. Dying in your sleep is generally considered to be a good thing, typically, not something to fear. Painless, and oblivious, at home.                Leave a Reply   Click here to cancel reply.

The site, DeathRiskRankings.com , is the brainchild of researchers and students at Carnegie Mellon University. It provides answers based on publicly available data from the United States and Europe, comparing mortality risks by gender, age, cause of death and geographic region. Put your info in, and it produces the probable causes of your demise and provides insight on the timing of that unfortunate event.  The site can compare such things as the odds of death next year by breast cancer for, say, a 54-year-old Pennsylvania woman or her counterpart in the United Kingdom.  Of course the results produced by the web site speak to groups of people and cannot predict with accuracy when you might actually kick the bucket . The timing of your own end is based on many uncharted factors, from heredity to lifestyle to untimely accidents.  But noodling around with the interface can be enlightening, if not frightening.  "It turns out that the British woman has a 33 percent higher risk of breast cancer death. But for lung/throat cancer, the results are almost reversed, and the Pennsylvania woman has a 29 percent higher risk," explained Paul Fischbeck, site developer and professor of social and decision sciences and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.  "Most Americans don't have a particularly good understanding of their own mortality risks , let alone ranking of their relevant risks," said David Gerard, a former professor at Carnegie Mellon who is now an associate professor of economics at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.  The researchers found that beyond infancy, the risk of dying increases annually at an exponential rate.  A 20-year-old U.S. woman has a 1 in 2,000 (or 0.05 percent) chance of dying in the next year, for example. By age 40, the risk is three times greater; by age 60, it is 16 times greater; and by age 80, it is 100 times greater (around 1 in 20 or 5 percent).  "The risks are higher, but still not that bad," Gerard said. "At 80, the average U.S. woman still has a 95 percent chance of making it to her 81st birthday."  Other results for queries about dying within the year:  For every age group, men have a much higher annual death risk than women. For 20-year-olds, the risk is 2.5 to three times greater for men. Men are much more prone to accidents, homicides and suicides, and the risk of dying from heart disease is always higher for men than women, peaking in the 50s when men are 2.5 times at greater risk of dying.  Women's cancer risks are higher than men's in their 30s and 40s.  For heart disease and cancer, U.S. blacks have a much higher death risk than U.S. whites. Overall, blacks in their 30s and 40s are twice as likely to die within the year as their white counterparts. Only for suicides, do whites consistently exceed blacks, where whites typically have two to three times greater chances of dying.  For 20-year-old males, 80 percent of their death risks are from accidents, homicides and suicides. By age 50, however, these causes make up less than 10 percent and heart disease is No. 1, accounting for more than 30 percent of all deaths.   Obesity-related death risks are much higher in the United States than in Europe. For example, the annual diabetes death risk in the United States is three times that found in northern Europe for 60 year olds.  Fischbeck and Gerard hope the site will add information to the U.S. healtchcare debate .  "We believe that this tool, which allows anyone to assess their own risk of dying and to compare their risks with counterparts in the United States and Europe, could help inform the public and constructively engage them in the debate," Fischbeck said.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.

Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

They formed a close bond and shared a flat for six months in Sydney before both heading back to the UK. Over the years the two kept in touch, despite marrying and having three children each. But one day Laura Berrill received the shocking news that Sarah Didinal had died in her sleep - at the age of just 37. Instant rapport "We clicked straight away, and it was amazing how two strangers, randomly meeting on the other side of the world, could create a close friendship so quickly, which would last right until her untimely death only 12 years later at the age of 37," Laura said.     "A few weeks after meeting, we both had enough money to get a tiny flat to share just around the corner from the beach. It was so much fun and probably one of the best times of my life. We worked hard, partied hard and laughed hard for six months" Laura, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, says she can never come to terms with losing Sarah so unexpectedly, from a condition she had never heard of - myocarditis. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart's muscle and is usually caused by a viral infection. Now Laura is trying to draw attention to the fact that young and seemingly healthy people, like Sarah, can be at risk. Every day in Britain, one person aged under 35 dies from a sudden death. Myocarditis, which Sarah had, can cause a cardiac arrhythmia.  I know she did not suffer but it is just so sad Laura Berrill   "There were no symptoms, nothing, she was perfectly healthy," said Laura. "She did not smoke, but she never stood a chance. She had had a bit of a cold and a sore throat and that was it. She went to bed and didn't wake up. "I know she did not suffer but it is just so sad. It is very difficult to comprehend." Risk warnings "I think about her every day and it hit me so hard - but what about her husband Andy, her parents and her three kids - Luke, Tom, Cameron - all under 11? "There was no other real sense to be made out of her death, and for the desperate loss felt by her family and friends.  Warning signs   A family history of unexpected, unexplained sudden death of an apparently healthy person  Fainting (syncope) or seizure during physical activity, emotional excitement, being distressed or startled or on arousal from sleep  Consistent or unusual chest pain and/or abnormal shortness of breath during exercise   "It should never have been Sarah as she loved life so much and had so much to live for. And so much more to give. "Sarah died in her sleep after having a lovely day - her last tweet said: 'Going to bed happy'. "That broke my heart in an instant because it so truly summed up what Sarah was all about. "I can't help but feel it was so wrong and I wish to this day there might have been something that could have stopped it, even though I know there wasn't." In the year since her friend died, Laura has tried to alert people to SADS, including doing a fun-run to raise awareness. "I knew nothing about it before. I just want people to know." Anne Jolly from SADS UK said that because of their suddenness, deaths like Sarah's, that of footballer Marc Vivien Foe and - most recently - Stephen Gately from Boyzone, left families bewildered. But she said there were signs that could alert people to their risk. "The charity especially highlights the fact that young people can suffer from cardiac conditions," she said. "SADS UK has urged [the] government to introduce cardiac assessment at the GP surgery, [and] to question family and personal medical history, to identify people at risk of SADS," she said. "Awareness and understanding are fundamental in preventing loss of further life, both within the same family and other families as yet unaffected.

I hope you've got someone you can talk to about your problems. Both depression and hypochondria are things you could use some professional help with. Do consider talking to your parents (if you still live at home) or your boyfriend/girlfriend, or finding a psychologist to talk to on your own. To answer your main question, the odds of getting a brain tumour are about 8 in 100,000. The odds of dying from it are smaller than that. The odds of dying from it with *NO* warning symptoms are even smaller. A small lump on your head is *not* a symptom of a brain tumour. A brain tumour would not make a lump on your head like you're imagining, nor could it push through the skull. And if you've been having these migraines on and off for more than a few months, they're most likely *not* tumour-induced headaches. I've put some links below that might help you. You might like to consider seeing your GP and getting a referral to a psychologist, or maybe some information on anti-depressive and anti-anxiety medication. Hypochondria affects about 5% of the US population.

Everyone alive has a less than 50 percent chance of dying while asleep because everyone sleeps less than half of their lifetime.  One increases those odds by ignoring the warning signs of illness, especially of heart attack, stroke and sleep apnea.  Ongoing reliance on sleeping pills when one has no illnesses is unnecessary.  I  sincerely advise  you to determine the exact cause or causes of your insomnia and work to get rid of the underlying cause of your sleeplessness by changing your environment, your behavior related to your discomfort and/or your thought patterns around bed time rather than taking sleeping pills.

Without Ever Waking?  October 25, 2004 7:50 AM   Subscribe  Can people actually die in their sleep, without first waking up with the pain or surprise of the sudden crisis that lead to their death?  What are the chances? [ More inside. ]   I'm aware that died in his/her sleep is often a euphemism but is it always so?  Imagine a fully conscious human being, not drugged beyond a sleeping pill or two.  Is it possible to go to sleep and die without waking up?  My totally ignorant and unmedical hunch is that whatever kills you is important enough to jolt you into wakefulness,  if only for a moment.  Many thanks for any informed advise or less scientifically unsupported opinions.  posted by MiguelCardoso to Science & Nature (23 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite           I have anecdotal evidence only. When my great-grandmother died in her sleep at the age of 95, my great aunt went in to wake her up and only discovered that she had died when she went to nudge her to wake her up. My feeling is that if there was some sort of shock of impending death, my great grandmother would have had some sort of "oh hell, this is it!" look on her face and not have appeared to be peacefully sleeping. posted by jessamyn at 7:59 AM on October 25, 2004  When I had my heart attack last year, I slept through the first four hours of it. I know this because when it first started, I mistook it for a cold coming on, and I took a nap. When I woke up, the pain had steadily grown so intense that 12 units of morphine couldn't touch it.  YMMV. ;-P posted by mischief at 8:01 AM on October 25, 2004  I'm sure it happens all the time. One of my best frients died in his sleep of a blood clot a few years ago. His wife slept on next to him, and was unaware until rising the next morning (I can think of few things more horrible). The only consolation is that the doctors told us that it was probably quick---his brain stopped receiving oxygen and he simply faded in his sleep, probably without pain. Were they telling us what we wanted to hear? I don't know. posted by bonehead at 8:03 AM on October 25, 2004  Imagine a fully conscious human being If you're close to death, chances are you may not be a fully conscious human being. There's no reason something has to "kill" you for you to die... sometimes you just stop living. posted by 4easypayments at 8:03 AM on October 25, 2004  Unfortunately the people with the best answers are dead. posted by smackfu at 8:03 AM on October 25, 2004  Miguel--you're assuming that most of your body is well-innervated with nerves; most organs are not. Most organs are lined only with a layer of connective tissue (visceral) that is not well innervated; you only get localized, stronger pain when the outer layer (parietal) is disrupted.  If you took out a chunk from the middle of most organs, not disrupting the surface, I don't think you'd be able to tell. posted by gramcracker at 8:10 AM on October 25, 2004 [ 1 favorite ]  Aside from the heart attack/blood clot stuff people have described, if you're very old, you often die in your sleep due to your body just "winding down". Sleep is inherently a state of lessened body activity- if you are already frail, your body may lack the strength to "wake back up" and just continue its descent.  Personally, I knew a guy who this happened to, out of the blue. He was a hardcore party guy, just shy of 30, and he died unexpectedly in his sleep- his body just decided to punt. posted by mkultra at 8:45 AM on October 25, 2004  I cracked my head badly enough to leave me unconscious for several minutes, and then passed in and out of consciousness during the next couple hours during the ambulance ride and hospital admittance.  I then slept very, very heavily the next few days while in a private IC room and a gawdawful IV drip of purest bone-chilling antibiotic poisons.  I could have kicked the bucket at most any time and I'd never, ever have realized it.  It was greatly reassuring: death isn't necessarily a fearful thing.  It can be completely... natural, I suppose.  Graceful, perhaps.  I conclude that one's brain kicks into a nice self-protection mode, in which it lets you die without undue mental stress. posted by five fresh fish at 9:06 AM on October 25, 2004  My 40-something neighbor died this way.  His wife woke up the next morning and found he had died sometime in the night.  She was lying next to him, so you would think if he was in any distress, she would have noticed.  There was no prior medical history.  The writer Shirley Jackson also died this way, a heart attack in her sleep at age 48.  If I remember right, I think she was taking a nap. posted by Secret Life of Gravy at 9:29 AM on October 25, 2004  I conclude that one's brain kicks into a nice self-protection mode, in which it lets you die without undue mental stress.  I'm not convinced, when you're ill sometimes you can go out catastrophically but other times it seems to me more like your body is trying to hang on but has diminishing resources to do so and systems gradually fade out, until eventually it packs in. You can still have a final rapid drop off but by that stage you're too gone to really be around for it anymore.  My mother also spent a fair bit of time in hospitals overnight and it was pretty frequent that old ladies would slip away in the night without anyone in the ward being disturbed. I would venture to say that some where 'natural' deaths but that some where chemically assisted. posted by biffa at 9:59 AM on October 25, 2004  My 80-something grandmother was found dead in exactly the same position she fell asleep. Her heart failed.  I see exactly where you're coming from with this question, but I think you're ignoring one thing: that moment of wakefulness, that "oh shit, I'm dying!" reaction would be an alert self-preservation response from a working body. An aged or ill person whose body finally gives out may or may not have the strength of body or quickness of nerve to wake up for that final gasp. If they did, they might not die at all.  I think some people really do slip away. posted by scarabic at 9:59 AM on October 25, 2004  My wife and I both promised each other that neither of us would die while asleep, just because of how inconsiderate it would be for the one who wakes up. posted by jasper411 at 10:12 AM on October 25, 2004  I had a stroke in my sleep when I was 28. I did eventually wake up, but there was no "Oh shit!" moment. It didn't even really hurt. I was mostly confused. I knew something was horribly wrong but I wasn't sure just what was going on. The people looking at me were more frightened than I was. I could definitely have slept through the whole thing. posted by astruc at 10:37 AM on October 25, 2004  Given that our brains can do some pretty creative things with external and internal phenomena while we sleep (I'm sure most people have experienced things like incorporating the alarm's beeping into a dream so they don't wake up, or dreaming that your arm falls off, only to wake up lying on it), I expect even if people do perceive whatever it is that's killing them in their sleep (assuming it's something catastrophic like a stroke, clot or sudden heart attack and not something more gradual like stopping breathing and subsequent anoxia, which seems unlikely to be perceived), it could well not be perceived as what it actually is.  I read an account of someone who almost died from a heroin overdose, and one of the things that really stuck with me was that they were aware enough to know that they weren't breathing, but didn't care enough to do anything about it (from the euphoria) - perhaps dying in your sleep is something like that.  Either way, people do seem to die while sleeping without waking up during the process. posted by biscotti at 10:57 AM on October 25, 2004  my grandma too, like scarabic. I think it's very common --your heart stops, or a blood clot bursts or something, and you just go. posted by amberglow at 12:01 PM on October 25, 2004  On a slightly related note, my dad had a tree fall on his head a few years ago.  It knocked him out cold, and when he came to a while later, he had to piece together what had happened from the evidence surrounding him: tree, broken hard-hat, headache.  Whenever he tells the story of "the time a tree fell on my head and knocked me out" he always finishes up by saying that he had always thought that the moment before something like that happens you might realize it and panic, but in his experience there was no "oh shit, I'm about to die!" moment, just lights on. lights off. The end.  Sort of comforting, really. posted by bonheur at 6:28 PM on October 25, 2004 [ 2 favorites ]  I read once that someone who gets shot in the head feels no more than slight tap. I have no way of verifying this however.  On a related note, is a death spasm more intense for a violent death than for a peaceful death? posted by mischief at 7:17 PM on October 25, 2004  I have seen people who died and didn't look like they had woken up from sleep.  I was with an aunt of mine during her last waking hours, when she was delirious but seemingly aware that she was dying--after a couple of hours, they gave her some medication that sent her to sleep and sent us home, and according to the nursing home staff she just "never woke up".  Her expression was certainly that of someone who was sleeping.  You might think that it's scary to be with someone who's dying, and it is, but on the other hand it's pretty easy to figure out what to do--you hold their hand and tell them you love them over and over.  And pray, if that's something they do.  Now I am a little sad thinking of this. posted by Sidhedevil at 10:03 PM on October 25, 2004  My grandmother "died in her sleep" last year. Upon taking her final breath, she was surrounded by her surviving sister, her surviving children (my father, two uncles and two aunts), one of her grandchildren (me) and my uncle's partner. Just along the hall was my partner with her yet-to-be-born great-grandchild and a priest from her parish.  She had been deteriorating for a long time. Dementia takes its time and whereas at the start of the last decade it crept slowly into her life and manifested itself mildly, it soon gathered pace and had accelerated at terrifying speed about a month before her death.  A week before she passed away, she had a massive stroke. She was taken to hospital and given a private room on an NHS ward. In the UK, this is a pretty sure sign that death is imminent, so two days later and with no change to her condition, the call went out for family to gather.  An aunt set off to the UK from Australia, an uncle from Spain and other close relatives from across the UK made their way to Yorkshire. I commuted over the Pennines a couple of times before camping out at a family friend's in York.  We kept a vigil over the course of three days. A member of her family was with her at all times. My aunt arrived from Australia and got to the hospital. My father, my partner and I were milling around outside talking to her when I got a call on my mobile to say that my grandmother's breathing was becoming more laboured. Not 5 minutes after her arrival from the other side of the planet, we made our way to the ward.  We entered the room together. There were eight of us gathered around. My grandmother's breathing was very ragged, her skin taught and pale. Hair that since time immemorial had crowned her head in regimented sweeps lay bedraggled on her shoulder.  My aunt removed the oxygen mask from my grandmother's face and held her left hand. My Uncle held her right. We all held hands in a semi circle in between them. We each prayed for her in our own way.  Her breathing continued in a laboured fashion for a few minutes. Without warning, my grandmother's eyes flashed open. With what seemed like remarkable clarity in her eyes, she surveyed the room. She squeezed her children’s hands.  She took a sharp intake of breath, closed her eyes and let out a cry.  It is very difficult to describe that moment. A full and complex range of emotions were expressed in no more than a matter of seconds. At first, she looked so terribly pained at the effort of living. Suddenly, the grimace evaporated in an expression of shock and her cry was cut short, as if caught in her throat.  After a moment, she let go.  With an unending sigh, a look of serene calmness spread through her. Her grip relaxed and her hands fell limp.  Had she been asleep? Had she been awake? Was she "conscious", was she "unconscious"?  I don't and can't know. posted by davehat at 6:48 AM on October 26, 2004  My mother died while awake and playing cards with my father.  She'd always had a bad heart, and it finally just gave out.  Dad said she suddenly leaned over onto the bed she'd been sitting on, still with a smile on her face.  She obviously had no "this is it" awareness; she just... went.  If that's possible when you're awake, it's obviously possible while you're asleep. posted by languagehat at 8:02 AM on October 26, 2004 [ 2 favorites ]  davehat: thank you. posted by iffley at 2:31 PM on October 26, 2004  You can certainly die in your sleep even if your brain is fully operational at the time.  Many of my patients who have died in their sleep told me they felt no -- er, wait a minute.  Seriously: I have seen lots of people die in a very calm, peaceful state, but they were not otherwise healthy - they were dying, in a hospital.  The experience of death remains a mystery to us; no one comes back to explain it.  However, people have died in various stages of sleep with EEGs and polysomnograms on; they do not always revert to a waking state.  The 13 year old girl who died of acute blood loss after a car accident, surrounded by her JW relatives, seemed to me to go very peacefully. posted by ikkyu2 at 4:13 PM on October 26, 2004  My first stepfather died in his sleep, of a massive heart attack.
