SHARE ON:        Keith Sutton  — May 3, 2011            Bands on a hunter’s call lanyard are considered special mementoes of hunts gone by. Photo by Keith Sutton     For waterfowl hunters, duck and goose bands are among the most treasured mementos of the hunt. Killing a banded bird is a special thrill. Wearing a lanyard of bands around your neck is a symbol of status.  The value and importance of waterfowl bands far exceeds that of mere jewelry, however. Hunters who report their bands play a vital role in waterfowl conservation. The reports not only provide interesting insight into the lives of waterfowl, but also hopefully foster a much greater appreciation for our quarry.  Duck Banding  From 1914 through 2007, about 13 million ducks had been banded in North America. The mallard leads the flock, with about 7 million banded. Blue-winged teal are a distant second at more than 1.5 million, followed by pintails and wood ducks (1.3 million), black ducks (1 million) and green-winged teal (500,000).  Not surprisingly, the duck bands most often found on hunters’ lanyards are those found on commonly banded species such as mallards (around 1 million recoveries), black ducks (160,000), pintails (147,000) and wood ducks (140,000). Among the real rarities are the 2,000 or so bands (per species) recovered from cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes and buffleheads. Rarer still are bands from ruddy ducks, long-tailed ducks (oldsquaws) and spectacled eiders. If you have a ruddy duck band, you’re one of only 550 hunters who can make that claim. Only 61 long-tailed duck bands have been recovered, and only 10 spectacled eider bands!  Goose Banding  Canadas are banded far more often than other goose species, with more than 2.8 million banded since 1914. Snow geese rank second at approximately 750,000, followed by white-fronted geese (specklebellies;122,000), black brants (107,000), Ross’s geese (76,000) and Atlantic brants (31,000).  More than 715,000 Canada goose bands have been recovered, 118,000 snow goose bands and 22,000 white-fronted goose bands. Among the real rarities are the 145 bands recovered from 9,500 banded emperor geese. Rarer still are bands from barnacle geese and Hawaiian geese. Should you have a barnacle goose band, it’s one of only nine ever recovered (only 11 barnacle geese have been banded). And only four Hawaiian goose bands have been recovered from the 700-plus birds that have been banded.      A band on the leg of a mallard. Hunters are encouraged to report bands to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Information gathered from bands is essential for developing annual hunting regulations and conservation programs. Credit: Ducks Unlimited     Glad To Be There  Ducks Unlimited biologist Mike Checkett was hunting on the Missouri River in 2003 when one of his hunting partners shot a Canada goose Checkett had banded in 1997.  Gator Food  A band placed on the leg of a pintail in Canada’s Northwest Territories was recovered from the stomach of an American alligator in Florida’s Orange Lake 13 months later.  Against All Odds  Dr. Stan Chace of Alturas, Calif., seemingly defied all odds in the fall of 1962. Chace bagged a banded Canada goose in October, and shot another banded Canada in December. When he compared the bands, Chace found them to be consecutively numbered — the first 518-31661 and the second 518-31662. The birds were banded three years earlier.  Duck Dogs  In the 1950s, biologists used retrievers to catch young mallards for banding on the nesting grounds in Canada.  Feeling Trapped  One black duck drake was captured 18 times during a nine-year span in Michigan Department of Conservation banding traps. An adult when first trapped and banded in 1949, the duck successfully eluded hunters and wildlife predators for 10 years. Caught in a trap on January 31, 1958, the bird’s original leg band, which was worn thin with age, was replaced.  Marathon Flyer Enjoys Travel      A happy hunter with a banded goose. Credit: Ducks Unlimited     A pintail banded on September 2, 1940, in Athabasca County of northern Alberta eluded hazards until January 1954 when it was shot near Naucuspana, Mexico. Considering the 3,000 miles between band site and death, and assuming the bird made the two-way migration each year for 13 years, the pintail would have logged nearly 80,000 migration miles during its lifetime.  Hitting The Jackpot  Acquiring one bird band a season is great. But how about two, on consecutive shots, on the same day? That’s what happened to Howard Ewart on November 23, 1996, when he shot a pair of banded mallard drakes while hunting on Wyoming’s Big Horn River. Also living a charmed existence was Jack Needles, who, on December 24, 1992, bagged a banded black duck drake and a banded mallard hen in New Jersey. The birds arrived as a pair.  Age Records  Information on life span is collected every time a banded bird is reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. And the record ages for some waterfowl species might surprise you.  •	Canada goose, 33 years, 3 months  •	Canvasback, 29 years, 6 months  •	Lesser snow goose, 27 years, 6 months  •	Black duck, 26 years, 5 months  •	Mallard 26 years, 4 months  •	Greater white-fronted goose, 23 years, 6 months  •	Blue-winged teal, 23 years, 3 months  •	Redhead, 22 years, 7 months  •	Ross’s goose, 22 years, 6 months  •	Wood duck, 22 years, 6 months    CATEGORIES:  Alligators Bird Hunting Waterfowl        Next post Retailing Longevity: How Does It Happen?

Anybody?         “For us hunting wasn’t a sport. It was a way to be intimate with nature, that intimacy providing us with wild unprocessed food free from pesticides and hormones and with the bonus of having been produced without the addition of great quantities of fossil fuel. In addition, hunting provided us with an ever scarcer relationship in a world of cities, factory farms, and agribusiness, direct responsibility for taking the lives that sustained us. Lives that even vegans indirectly take as the growing and harvesting of organic produce kills deer, birds, snakes, rodents, and insects. We lived close to the animals we ate. We knew their habits and that knowledge deepened our thanks to them and the land that made them.”  Ted Kerasote   ​     NCWaterfowler ,  Jan 16, 2006      NCWaterfowler ,  Jan 16, 2006     #1           Jan 16, 2006    #2            WWR  Elite Refuge Member      Messages:  17,026    Joined:  Mar 30, 2005    Location:  No gano...pero como me divierto, TX          I heard it was 1 out of 100...

They must be pretty good odds I would say.  Five guys here including myself that hunt everyday have killed 9 fed banded ducks, 7 NC waterfowl banded mallard trash, and 4 banded canadas.  This is a below average year for the bands here.  I will be interested to see some numbers.

There have been seasons where I have killed in excess of 250 birds and no bands.  There has been one season where between 4 of us we killed over 500 mallards and not one single band.

I hunt areas in Canada where they band ducks and we do well there. I have gotten banded birds in other states too during the migration.  So,, I say location has a bunch to do with it,,, and a little luck.

More mallards equal more bands...I got 4 bands on 111 ducks one year...this year zero for 88!      P.S. I'm not a professional guide, it's just a nickname a friend gave me.

In coastal Texas where I hunt these happen to be the least harvest waterfowl so the odds here are very slim.  In 20 years of waterfowl hunting I have been the party that killed a banded redhead and a banded mottled duck.  So the odds down here are probably closer to 1 in 1000.      Remember the good ole days..... 39 days and 3 ducks?

They said they did a post season banding and caught 296 ducks as part of their wintering black duck study. Of those ducks, 169 were mallards, 87 were black ducks and 40 were MALLARD X BLACK hybrids!!  seems pretty amazing how prolific the biologist have proven the true hybrid is on the CT coast ...  they have radio collared 26 female black duck in the last two years!! and only 9 have died....  as a side note CT banded  1,302 ducks prior to the season this past year,  1,190 mallards, 56 wood ducks 40 black ducks 14 mallard x black hybrids , 1 teal and 1 pintail.  on another side note, they caught 757 adult geese this past summer, 430 which were previously banded...  makes one think that shooting a goose in ct has high odds of resulting in the aquisition of a band!!  bad bob      we constantly, dont do things that way     Bob Johnson ,  Feb 10, 2010      Bob Johnson ,  Feb 10, 2010     #1           Feb 10, 2010    #2            FullandFuller  Elite Refuge Member      Messages:  1,233    Joined:  Dec 8, 2005    Location:  PA          That ratio of mallard/black/hybrids does not surprise me one bit.   We see a lot of hybridization here.  It would be really interesting to see the pictures of each duck as well, to see what the ducks actually look like and how they were categorized.  That came out wrong, I do know what a duck actually looks like...but you know what I mean hehe.

There isn't a problem right now, currently Blacks and Mallards occupy some of the same niches - hence the hybrids. People are worried that the Black Duck species will eventually be bred out by the Mallards.  I might be inclined to agree, but it is going to take a while.  Something else, a lot of folks don't know how to count them (hybrids) in their daily bag limit, problem is neither do some Conservation Officers.

They said they did a post season banding and caught 296 ducks as part of their wintering black duck study. Of those ducks, 169 were mallards, 87 were black ducks and 40 were MALLARD X BLACK hybrids!!  seems pretty amazing how prolific the biologist have proven the true hybrid is on the CT coast ...  they have radio collared 26 female black duck in the last two years!! and only 9 have died....  as a side note CT banded  1,302 ducks prior to the season this past year,  1,190 mallards, 56 wood ducks 40 black ducks 14 mallard x black hybrids , 1 teal and 1 pintail.  on another side note, they caught 757 adult geese this past summer, 430 which were previously banded...  makes one think that shooting a goose in ct has high odds of resulting in the aquisition of a band!!  bad bob Click to expand...   sounds to me that for the most part the birds in CT are resident, probably partially domesticated urban waterfowl.(like pigeons)..the blacks there probably don't even migrate much. Marina mallards, urban park ducks etc. are infiltratin the local blackduck gene pool. As more and more mallards become resident park ducks in all the urban sprawl that is on the east coast the resident blacks are gonna be in trouble. just my opinion..I believe the waterfowl landscape in the AF has evolved into a partially domesticated urban population of resident canadas and mallards for alot of areas..particularly along the coast where there is always open water and a ton of unhuntable areas.

I see birds all year...but then again...when i visit my parents in NC...what do I see in the summer down there??  canada geese and mallards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I havent read anything on the findings of the radio fitted birds...  for sure there are a lot of blacks that breed in new england states...  but the majority of the coastal birds wintering here come from the canadian coastal states, from what i have heard....  you could probably find some banding info on blacks shot in ct , and see where most are banded...  bob      we constantly, dont do things that way     Bob Johnson ,  Feb 11, 2010      Bob Johnson ,  Feb 11, 2010     #9           Feb 11, 2010    #10            FullandFuller  Elite Refuge Member      Messages:  1,233    Joined:  Dec 8, 2005    Location:  PA          The blacks and hybrids we kill are not local birds as far as I can tell.

We usually hunt just east of Dallas but we have gone for geese down on the coast and up in the panhandle a couple of times and we have even hunted a small amount out in East Texas.  Over the past 20 years we figured we had probably shot more than 1,500 ducks and geese and we have NEVER even seen a band!  Most of what we shoot are gadwalls, widgeon, green wings, early season blue wings and (before we got smart and started passing on them) way too many ringnecks.  (You can only eat so much gumbo!)  We have nailed exactly ONE canvasback, TWO pintail, and not all that many more mallards during this same period of time although between the two of us we usually average about 6 ducks per trip.  I won't even try and tell you how many dove we have shot during this same period of time and there have been no bands there either.  I guess it depends a bit on where you hunt, and like I said we hunt ALMOST exclusively 20 miles from Dallas.  Any other contenders for this record?  PS  My buddy thought our number should be somewhere north of 2,000 ducks.

I have been hunting waterfowl for over 40 years and have only shot one banded Honker.  Last year I took my cousin's 11-year-old son out for his first duck hunt.  He only shot one time and downed a banded bull Sprig.  Go figure!

I have read things though, saying roughly 1 in 160 (dont quote me here i am just remembering) mallards were banded. Mallards being the majority of birds that are banded, so if you shoot exclusively mallards you have a better chance. 2nd most banded, blue wing teal I think.  That being said, i have killed at least a dozen goose bands, like the guy said earlier, they band alot where I hunt.

Alot have been mottled ducks couple Bluewings one gw and a mallard and a fulvouse whistling duck. I hunt a lot and we kill a lot of birds. My cousin that I hunt with a lot hasnt killed a banded bird in several years...just luck of the draw I guess. I was lucky enough to kill a double banded mottle duck a couple years ago and made 100 bucks. Last year in that same spot produced 8 bands, I didn't kill any of them but it was a hot spot. Now my dad on the other hand has the luck of the Irish...he usually makes one or two hunts a year and gets a band.      Consider it DONE!

But i hunted many years without a single band. Seems like when i first started hunting in 1972 i hunted about 15 years without a band. I must have shot 700 ducks in that time frame with  no bands.  I have several since then.  And i have had one each of the last 3 seasons. It seems to me that where you hunt and what type of birds you shoot has a lot to do with it.  And i am guessing that they band more now then years ago.  Joe      A bad day hunting beats a good day at work. Why whould anybody from the Phillippines buy a Japanese car?

Now, this does not figure into areas that have high banding studies, like certain lakes and such we know has a lot of bands, just some seriously average amounts based on the numbers (I crunch numbers at work way too much, fun to do with waterfowl). So.....here we go- and remember, most of this is hogwash and luck still has most of the factor!   Canvasback  1 Band for every 1,112 Harvests   Mallard  1 Band for every 117 Harvests        .   GreenWing Teal  1 Band for every 1,249 Harvests   American Wigeon  1 Band for every 1,382 Harvests   Redhead  1 Band for every 198 Harvests   Scaup (Both Together)  1 Band for every 1,688 Harvests   Harlequin  1 Band for every 11 Harvests   Pintail  1 Band for every 342 Harvests   Shoveler  1 Band for every 10,032 Harvests   Gadwall  1 Band for every 2,592 Harvests   Barrows Goldeneye  1 Band for every 62 Harvests   Hooded Merganser  1 Band for every 1,312 Harvests   Snow Goose (All Species Lumped Together)  1 Band for every 934 Harvests   Canada Goose (All Species Lumped Together)  1 Band for every 98 Harvests   Brant Goose (All Species Lumped Together)  1 Band for every 13 Harvests     Some are small because of low Harvest rates and high level of studies.

Extremely low banding, very few recoveries, and a substancial poplulation...kind of interesting....

Yikes on the Buffs.....didn't Toby get one? Now that is special...  dmarks....I will be honest...I am going to try and deflect some of the off season bickering here with some hopefully interesting, mostly nonsensical, posts. Probably more to keep me interested as well.  Anyways, these numbers are pretty much based on total averages, so in a perfect world for these to be 100% accurate they would have to band the same amount every year for 50 years. Obviously that is far from accurate, but hopefully the law of averages takes over and this can be somewhat close. Take Harlequins, some years if the studies are in full swing, it can run 50%, right now it is really low as most of the WA studies are long gone and most bands are coming from Canada and Oregon. Lots of species fluctuate...so take these as long term averages...it is funny how they really can be applied to my harvests...

Can't we just all get along     Now back to your thread.  I can really appreciate what you have done.  I have asked this question before and was somewhat surprised by the response I got from those in the waterfowl bio world.  Still, I think what you have done, albeit rough and perhaps flawed is a great stab at it.  I suspect using the law of averages is good because you would also have to factor in natural mortality, predation, and other events that lead to death other than by gun.  So perhaps by averaging the highs and lows of banding compenstes for other mortality related issues that are not in your equation (though honestly I doubt it).  Great job and very interesting.

SHARE ON:        Keith Sutton  — May 3, 2011            Bands on a hunter’s call lanyard are considered special mementoes of hunts gone by. Photo by Keith Sutton     For waterfowl hunters, duck and goose bands are among the most treasured mementos of the hunt. Killing a banded bird is a special thrill. Wearing a lanyard of bands around your neck is a symbol of status.  The value and importance of waterfowl bands far exceeds that of mere jewelry, however. Hunters who report their bands play a vital role in waterfowl conservation. The reports not only provide interesting insight into the lives of waterfowl, but also hopefully foster a much greater appreciation for our quarry.  Duck Banding  From 1914 through 2007, about 13 million ducks had been banded in North America. The mallard leads the flock, with about 7 million banded. Blue-winged teal are a distant second at more than 1.5 million, followed by pintails and wood ducks (1.3 million), black ducks (1 million) and green-winged teal (500,000).  Not surprisingly, the duck bands most often found on hunters’ lanyards are those found on commonly banded species such as mallards (around 1 million recoveries), black ducks (160,000), pintails (147,000) and wood ducks (140,000). Among the real rarities are the 2,000 or so bands (per species) recovered from cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes and buffleheads. Rarer still are bands from ruddy ducks, long-tailed ducks (oldsquaws) and spectacled eiders. If you have a ruddy duck band, you’re one of only 550 hunters who can make that claim. Only 61 long-tailed duck bands have been recovered, and only 10 spectacled eider bands!  Goose Banding  Canadas are banded far more often than other goose species, with more than 2.8 million banded since 1914. Snow geese rank second at approximately 750,000, followed by white-fronted geese (specklebellies;122,000), black brants (107,000), Ross’s geese (76,000) and Atlantic brants (31,000).  More than 715,000 Canada goose bands have been recovered, 118,000 snow goose bands and 22,000 white-fronted goose bands. Among the real rarities are the 145 bands recovered from 9,500 banded emperor geese. Rarer still are bands from barnacle geese and Hawaiian geese. Should you have a barnacle goose band, it’s one of only nine ever recovered (only 11 barnacle geese have been banded). And only four Hawaiian goose bands have been recovered from the 700-plus birds that have been banded.      A band on the leg of a mallard. Hunters are encouraged to report bands to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Information gathered from bands is essential for developing annual hunting regulations and conservation programs. Credit: Ducks Unlimited     Glad To Be There  Ducks Unlimited biologist Mike Checkett was hunting on the Missouri River in 2003 when one of his hunting partners shot a Canada goose Checkett had banded in 1997.  Gator Food  A band placed on the leg of a pintail in Canada’s Northwest Territories was recovered from the stomach of an American alligator in Florida’s Orange Lake 13 months later.  Against All Odds  Dr. Stan Chace of Alturas, Calif., seemingly defied all odds in the fall of 1962. Chace bagged a banded Canada goose in October, and shot another banded Canada in December. When he compared the bands, Chace found them to be consecutively numbered — the first 518-31661 and the second 518-31662. The birds were banded three years earlier.  Duck Dogs  In the 1950s, biologists used retrievers to catch young mallards for banding on the nesting grounds in Canada.  Feeling Trapped  One black duck drake was captured 18 times during a nine-year span in Michigan Department of Conservation banding traps. An adult when first trapped and banded in 1949, the duck successfully eluded hunters and wildlife predators for 10 years. Caught in a trap on January 31, 1958, the bird’s original leg band, which was worn thin with age, was replaced.  Marathon Flyer Enjoys Travel      A happy hunter with a banded goose. Credit: Ducks Unlimited     A pintail banded on September 2, 1940, in Athabasca County of northern Alberta eluded hazards until January 1954 when it was shot near Naucuspana, Mexico. Considering the 3,000 miles between band site and death, and assuming the bird made the two-way migration each year for 13 years, the pintail would have logged nearly 80,000 migration miles during its lifetime.  Hitting The Jackpot  Acquiring one bird band a season is great. But how about two, on consecutive shots, on the same day? That’s what happened to Howard Ewart on November 23, 1996, when he shot a pair of banded mallard drakes while hunting on Wyoming’s Big Horn River. Also living a charmed existence was Jack Needles, who, on December 24, 1992, bagged a banded black duck drake and a banded mallard hen in New Jersey. The birds arrived as a pair.  Age Records  Information on life span is collected every time a banded bird is reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. And the record ages for some waterfowl species might surprise you.  •	Canada goose, 33 years, 3 months  •	Canvasback, 29 years, 6 months  •	Lesser snow goose, 27 years, 6 months  •	Black duck, 26 years, 5 months  •	Mallard 26 years, 4 months  •	Greater white-fronted goose, 23 years, 6 months  •	Blue-winged teal, 23 years, 3 months  •	Redhead, 22 years, 7 months  •	Ross’s goose, 22 years, 6 months  •	Wood duck, 22 years, 6 months    CATEGORIES:  Alligators Bird Hunting Waterfowl        Next post Retailing Longevity: How Does It Happen?

To report a band, go to ReportBand.gov  In 1902, Dr. Paul Bartsch of the Smithsonian Institution was the first to band birds in North America - 23 black-crowned night herons near Washington, D.C. Many banders followed, and banding and recovery records have been kept since 1914.  The first large-scale North American banding program was established in 1922.  Through 2007, about 16 million waterfowl have been banded in North America, including about 13 million ducks.  Biologists band more than 200,000 ducks and nearly 150,000 geese and swans in North America each year.  About 85,000-90,000 bands are reported each year.  Through 2009, most duck banding efforts have focused on mallards. The mallard is the most commonly banded and most commonly harvested duck in the United States and Canada. Approximately 7 million mallards have been banded through 2007.  The oldest known waterfowl banded in North America was a Canada goose that lived to be 30 years and 4 months old. The oldest mallard lived to 26 years, 4 months.

A researcher uses a tool to attach the band to the leg of this European serin .       Ringing of black-headed gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus ( Laridae ) nestling       Pupils watch a bird ringing activity during "A day at the wetland", organised by environmental group WWF. The same individual, an adult Fringilla coelebs, had been caught again in the same area last year in Lesvos, Greece    Bird ringing or bird banding is the attachment of a small, individually numbered metal or plastic tag to the leg or wing of a wild bird to enable individual identification. This helps in keeping track of the movements of the bird and its life history. It is common to take measurements and examine conditions of feather molt, subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex during capture for ringing. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration , longevity, mortality, population, territoriality , feeding behavior , and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists . Other methods of marking birds may also be used to allow for field based identification that does not require capture.

One instance occurred during the Punic Wars: In 218 BC a crow was released by a besieged garrison (which suggests that this was an established practice). Quintus Fabius Pictor used a thread on the bird's leg to send a message back. In another instance, a knight interested in chariot races during the time of Pliny (AD 1) took crows to Volterra, 135 miles (217 km) away and released them with information on the race winners. [2]  Falconers in the Middle Ages would fit plates on their falcons with seals of their owners. From around 1560 or so, swans were marked with a swan mark , a nick on the bill. [3] [4]  Storks injured by arrows (termed as pfeilstorch in German) traceable to African tribes were found in Germany in 1822 and constituted some of the earliest evidence of long distance migration in European birds. [5]  In North America John James Audubon and Ernest Thompson Seton were pioneers although their method of marking birds was different from modern ringing. In order to determine if the same bird would return to his farm, Audubon tied silver threads onto the legs of young eastern phoebes in 1803, while Seton marked snow buntings in Manitoba with ink in 1882. [6] Ringing of birds for more extensive scientific purposes was started in 1899 by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen , a Danish schoolteacher, using aluminum rings on European starlings (Mortensen had tried using zinc rings as early as 1890 but found these were too heavy). [7] The first banding scheme was established in Germany by Johannes Thienemann in 1903 at the Rossitten Bird Observatory on the Baltic Coast of East Prussia. This was followed by Hungary in 1908, Great Britain in 1909 (by Arthur Landsborough Thomson in Aberdeen and Harry Witherby in England ), Yugoslavia [ clarification needed ] in 1910 and the Scandinavian countries between 1911 and 1914. [8]  Paul Bartsch of the Smithsonian Institution is credited with the first modern banding in the U.S.: he banded 23 black-crowned night herons in 1902. [9] [10] [11]  Leon J. Cole of the University of Wisconsin founded the American Bird Banding Association in 1909; this organization oversaw banding until the establishment of federal programs in the U.S. (1920) and Canada (1923) pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1918. [11]  Terminology and techniques [ edit ]     A banded ruby-crowned kinglet recaptured in a mist net    Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the USA and Australia. Organised ringing efforts are called ringing or banding schemes, and the organisations that run them are ringing or banding authorities. (Birds are ringed rather than rung ) Those who ring or band birds are known as ringers or banders, and they are typically active at ringing or banding stations.  Birds may be captured by being taken as young birds at the nest , or as adults, captured in fine mist nets , baited traps, Heligoland traps , drag nets, cannon nets , or by other methods. Raptors may be caught by many methods, including bal-chatri traps.  When a bird is caught, a ring of suitable size (usually made of aluminium or other lightweight material) is attached to the bird's leg, and has on it a unique number, as well as a contact address. The bird is often weighed and measured, examined for data relevant to the ringer's project, and then released. The rings are very light, and are designed to have no adverse effect on the birds – indeed, the whole basis of using ringing to gain data about the birds is that ringed birds should behave in all respects in the same way as the unringed population. The birds so tagged can then be identified when they are re-trapped, or found dead, later.  When a ringed bird is found, and the ring number read and reported back to the ringer or ringing authority, this is termed a ringing recovery or control [ citation needed ] . The finder can contact the address on the ring, give the unique number, and be told the known history of the bird's movements. Some national ringing/banding authorities also accept reports by phone or on official web sites.  The organising body, by collating many such reports, can then determine patterns of bird movements for large populations. Non-ringing/banding scientists can also obtain data for use in bird-related research.     A yellow-throated fulvetta with a numbered aluminum ring on its left tarsus    At times in North America, the bands have just a unique number (without an address) that is recorded along with other identifying information on the bird. If the bird is recaptured the number on the band is recorded (along with other identifying characteristics) as a retrap . All band numbers and information on the individual birds are then entered into a database and the information often shared throughout North American banding operations. This way information on retrapped birds is more readily available and easy to access.  Equipment used in bird banding [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (February 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Introduction [ edit ]  When deciding on bird banding equipment one must decide what species of bird they’d like to focus on. Many of the supplies used during an operation are determined by how big a bird is. The essential equipment includes a bird identification guide, mist nets, banding pliers, leg gauge, wing ruler, and a digital scale. However, before starting a bird banding operation a permit is necessary to purchase all of the equipment. This will then be taken into consideration that all the equipment purchased must be made to last, be efficient, safe on the birds, and easy for anyone to use.  Mist net [ edit ]  Mist net come in a variety of sizes and lengths according to the bird’s size. All nets are made from a black nylon material and come with 4 shelves to catch the birds once they fly into the net. When purchasing a mist-net for sparrows the height usually stays the same at 2.7 meters but varies in width at 6 meters to 18 meters at a 30mm mesh. Determining net size for large sparrows to jays are 2.6 meters high and varying in widths at 6 meters to 18 meters at a 38mm mesh. If the study requires the banding of large owls a specific net is required and it is made with a heavier material to withstand the talons of the owl at 60mm mesh. Banding hawks also requires a heavier material at 100mm or 127mm mesh. However, some nets for larger birds include an additional shelve at 5 instead of 4. [12]  Banding Pliers [ edit ]  Banding pliers are an essential tool that helps place the band around a bird’s leg. These pliers come in different sizes as determined by how wide a bird’s leg is. Pliers are sized between 0A-1A, 2–3, and 3B, 3A, and 4. [13]  Leg Gauge [ edit ]  The band size is determined by using the leg gauge. A leg gauge is placed around the bird’s leg which determines the circumference of the leg. After identifying the size of a band it is then placed on around the leg with the help from the banding pliers. [12] In Australia, band size range from 1 to 15, plus special sizes for birds whose leg shapes require special bands, such as parrots and pelicans. [14]  Wing Ruler [ edit ]  When looking through the Pyle textbook some birds can be identified by the wing cord. The next essential piece of equipment is the wing ruler, which is used to determine the length of the wing for data collection, research purposes, or determining species. [12]  Digital Scale [ edit ]  Once the processing of the bird’s morphology has been completed the last piece of equipment used is a digital scale. This helps with determining the weight of the bird. This is the last step before releasing the bird. [12]  Limitations [ edit ]  Certain bird species are for various reasons unsuitable for ringing. In some countries, such as Australia, there exist laws prohibiting banding of such species. [14]  Many very large birds, such as ratites , flamingos and the largest swans , are extremely difficult to band because the cost of making a band which is capable of securely fitting their strong, heavy legs is prohibitive. At the other extreme, the smaller species of river and tree kingfishers , todies and certain lories , have such narrow tarsii that no band can be securely placed around it without imposing danger to blood circulation. With some gamebirds, such as the Indian Peafowl , spurs on the legs interfere with the bands, which thus can cause injury to the birds.  Many species of cockatoo – which even if able to be banded require special bands to fit the unique shape of their legs – will crush bands with their powerful bills and claws. [15] The ability to overcome this problem varies between species, and with some such as the Gang-gang cockatoo , it is known to be too dangerous to attempt banding. New World vultures also cannot be banded on their legs because they urinate onto their legs, causing corrosion of the bands into a powdery oxide that sticks to the vulture’s leg and injures the bird. Dippers are also dangerously handicapped by ringing because the rings induce drag that makes it extremely difficult for them to catch prey in fast-flowing water.  Among species which can be safely ringed, there are major limitations among nomadic species of the deserts of the Eastern Hemisphere and cardueline finches of the taiga . The highly unpredictable movements inherent in these species’ lifestyles means that recovery rates are extremely low, [16] [17] especially given generally low population densities within their habitats.  Similar schemes [ edit ]  Wing tags [ edit ]     This female great frigatebird has been tagged with wing tags as part of a breeding study    In some surveys, involving larger birds such as eagles, brightly coloured plastic tags are attached to birds' wing feathers. Each has a letter or letters, and the combination of colour and letters uniquely identifies the bird. These can then be read in the field, through binoculars, meaning that there is no need to re-trap the birds. Because the tags are attached to feathers, they drop off when the bird moults .  Another method is imping in a brightly colored false feather instead of a natural feather. [18]  A patagial tag is a permanent tag held onto the wing by a rivet punched through the patagium . [19]  Radio transmitters and satellite-tracking [ edit ]  Where detailed information is needed on individual movements, tiny radio transmitters can be fitted on to birds. For small species the transmitter is carried as a 'backpack' fitted over the wing bases, and for larger species it may be attached to a tail feather or looped to the legs. Both types usually have a tiny (10 cm) flexible aerial to improve signal reception. Two field receivers (reading distance and direction) are needed to establish the bird's position using triangulation from the ground. The technique is useful for tracing individuals during landscape-level movements particularly in dense vegetation (such as tropical forests) and for shy or difficult-to-spot species, because birds can be located from a distance without visual confirmation. [20] [21]  The use of satellite transmitters for bird movements is currently restricted by transmitter size – to species larger than about 400g. They may be attached to migratory birds (geese, swans, cranes, penguins etc.) or other species such as penguins that undertake long-distance movements. Individuals may be tracked by satellites for immense distances, for the lifetime of the transmitter battery. As with wing tags, the transmitters may be designed to drop off when the bird moults; or they may be recovered by recapturing the bird. [22] [23]  Field-readable rings [ edit ]     A colour-ringed herring gull    A field-readable is a ring or rings, usually made from plastic and brightly coloured, which may also have conspicuous markings in the form of letters and/or numbers. They are used by biologists working in the field to identify individual birds without recapture and with a minimum of disturbance to their behaviour. Rings large enough to carry numbers are usually restricted to larger birds, although if necessary small extensions to the rings (leg flags) bearing the identification code allow their use on slightly smaller species. For small species (e.g. most passerines), individuals can be identified by using a combination of small rings of different colours, which are read in a specific order. Most colour-marks of this type are considered temporary (the rings degrade, fade and may be lost or removed by the birds) and individuals are usually also fitted with a permanent metal ring.  Leg-flags [ edit ]  Similar to coloured rings or bands are leg-flags, usually made of Darvic and used in addition to numbered metal bands. Although leg-flags may sometimes have individual codes on them, their more usual use is to code for the sites where the birds were banded in order to elucidate their migration routes and staging areas. The use of colour-coded leg-flags is part of an international program, originated in Australia in 1990, by the countries of the East Asian - Australasian Flyway to identify important areas and routes used by migratory waders . [24]  Other markers [ edit ]  Head and neck markers are very visible, and may be used in species where the legs are not normally visible (such as ducks and geese). Nasal discs and nasal saddles can be attached to the culmen with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils . They should not be used if they obstruct breathing. They should not be used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. [25]  Neck collars made of expandable, non-heat-conducting plastic are very useful for larger birds such as geese. [26]  Bird ringing and education [ edit ]  Many institutions that ring birds offer demonstrations for the public, where experts ring live birds while highlighting the steps of the process and answering questions from the public. [27] Educating visitors about the technique helps to spread accurate information about it to the public. [28] While live bird ringing is not the only method of educating the public on bird conservation, it can be an especially engaging and unique method for visitors. [29]  Some results [ edit ]     Ringed Larus ridibundus in flight    Ringing activities are often regulated by national agencies but because ringed birds may be found across countries, there are consortiums that ensure that recoveries and reports are collated. In the UK, bird ringing is organized by the British Trust for Ornithology . In North America the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory collaborates with Canadian programs and since 1996, partners with the North American Banding Council (NABC). [30] The European Union for Bird Ringing (EURING) consolidates ringing data from the various national programs in Europe. [31] In Australia, the Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme manages all bird and bat ringing information. [32] while SAFRING manages bird ringing activities in South Africa. [33] Bird ringing in India is managed by the Bombay Natural History Society . The National Center for Bird Conservation (CEMAVE) coordinates a national scheme for bird ringing in Brazil.

Duck hunters are encouraged to report duck bands to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Information gathered from duck bands is essential for developing annual hunting regulations and conservation programs.  Colored second duck bands with no dollar amount are visual markers used by researchers who want to identify ducks at a distance. These should be reported along with regular duck band numbers. Why Band Ducks? When a duck is fitted with a band, the bander records where and when the bird is banded, how old it is, what sex it is and other information. Those records then are sent to the Bird Banding Laboratory where they are entered into a computer database. If a duck band is later reported, scientists can use the information to learn more about a species.  During the earliest days of duck banding, researchers simply wanted to know more about duck migration. But today, duck band returns also provide information about a species’ abundance, distribution, numbers, life span, causes of death and more. Data from banded ducks are used to monitor population levels, assess the effects of environmental disturbances and address concerns such as bird hazards at airports and crop depredations. Results from duck banding studies also support national and international conservation programs such as the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. Each year, biologists thoroughly analyze band returns and use the information to assess duck hunting pressure, estimate productivity and survival, and measure the vulnerability of the age/sex classes to hunting pressure. This information is essential for developing the duck hunting regulations each of us must follow to assure duck populations aren’t harmed by overharvest.  To determine duck band reporting rates, researchers periodically band ducks with standard (silver) and reward (colored) bands offering various dollar amounts to those who report reward bands.  Duck-Banding Facts Biologists band more than 200,000 ducks each year, with information recovered for large numbers of those birds. In 2001, for example, 222,006 ducks were banded and 48,576 bands recovered. Through 2007, about 13 million ducks had been banded in North America. The Mallard leads the flock, with about 7 million banded. Blue-Winged Teal are a distant second at more than 1.5 million, followed by pintails and wood ducks (1.3 million), Black Ducks (1 million) and Green-Winged Teal (500,000). The most commonly banded diving duck is the Lesser Scaup at 350,000 plus. Redheads (270,000), canvasbacks (160,000) and Ring-Necked Ducks (155,000) are next on the list. The black scoter is near the bottom of the list, with only about 340 banded to date. The remoteness of the Black Scoter’s breeding range in northern Canada and Alaska has made it difficult for waterfowl biologists to capture and band this species. Ducks almost never banded include masked ducks (3) and tufted ducks (2).  Not surprisingly, the duck bands most often found on duck hunters’ lanyards are those found on commonly banded species such as Mallards (around 1 million recoveries), Black Ducks (160,000), Pintails (147,000) and Wood Ducks (140,000). Among the real rarities are the 2,000 or so bands (per species) recovered from Cinnamon Teal, Common Goldeneyes and Buffleheads. Rarer still are bands from Ruddy Ducks, Long-Tailed Ducks and Spectacled Eiders. If you have a Ruddy Duck band, you’re one of only 550 duck hunters who can make that claim. Only 61 Long-Tailed duck bands have been recovered, and only 10 Spectacled Eider bands! Reporting A Duck Band Of the more than 1 million birds banded each year in North America, 87 percent of all recoveries reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory are from waterfowl. Surprisingly, however, of all the banded birds killed by duck hunters, only 30 to 40 percent are reported. Given the tremendous cost associated with the banding effort and the reliance on duck banding as an essential management and research tool, the loss of data associated with this low band-reporting rate is regrettable. Any band you recover is yours to keep, and reporting information is easy. To report a band via the Internet, visit www.reportband.gov. To report a band by telephone, you can call toll-free to 1-800-327-BAND (2263) from anywhere in Canada, the United States and most parts of the Caribbean.  Information needed for a report includes the duck band number; how, when and where the duck band was found; and the name and address of the person reporting the duck band. About three to four weeks after you submit a report, you’ll receive a certificate of appreciation from the Bird Banding Lab and basic banding information about the bird you are reporting, including the state or province where the bird was banded, the date it was banded and the species. Sometimes duck hunters find very old duck bands with the numbers worn and unreadable. The numbers on these duck bands still can be determined by a process called etching if the hunter sends the band to the Bird Banding Lab, 12100 Beech Forest Rd., Laurel, MD 20708-4037. Hundreds of bands are etched and returned to hunters every year.  Frederick Lincoln with the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey was a key player in early efforts to develop a system for banding ducks and other birds in the U.S.  Duck Band Trivia  While duck hunting in Missouri, biologist George Brakhage killed a gadwall he had banded several weeks earlier in North Dakota.  A duck band placed on the leg of a Pintail in Canada’s Northwest Territories was recovered from the stomach of an American alligator in Florida’s Orange Lake 13 months later.  One Black Duck Drake was captured 18 times during a nine-year span in the waterfowl banding traps of the Michigan Department of Conservation. An adult when first trapped and banded in 1949, the duck successfully eluded hunters and wildlife predators for 10 years. Caught in a trap on January 31, 1958, the bird’s original leg band, which was worn thin with age, was replaced.  A Pintail banded on September 2, 1940, in Athabasca County of northern Alberta eluded hazards until January 1954 when it was shot near Naucuspana, Tabasco, Mexico. Considering the 3,000 miles between band site and death, and assuming the bird made the two-way migration each year for 13 years, the Pintail would have logged nearly 80,000 migration miles during its lifetime.  Acquiring one bird band a season ranks right up there. But how about two, on consecutive shots, on the same day? That’s what happened to Howard Ewart on November 23, 1996, when he shot a pair of Mallard Drakes (1007-31302) and (1337-79713) while hunting on the Big Horn River near Thermopolis, Wyoming. Also living a charmed existence was Jack Needles, who, on December 24, 1992, bagged a drake black duck (1287-82810) and a hen mallard (1287-82870) near Stone Harbor, New Jersey. The birds arrived as a pair.   Age Records Information on life span is collected every time a banded bird is reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. And the record ages for some duck species may surprise you.  Canvasback, 29 years, 6 months  Mallard 27 years, 7 months  Black duck, 26 years, 5 months  Blue-winged Teal, 23 years, 3 months  Redhead, 22 years, 7 months  Wood Duck, 22 years, 6 months  Pintail, 22 years, 3 months  American Wigeon, 21 years, 4 months  Ring-Necked Duck, 20 years, 5 months  Green-Winged Teal, 20 years, 3 months  Duck Banding Conclusion As you can see, the value and importance of duck bands far exceeds that of mere jewelry. Duck hunters who harvest birds and report their bands provide invaluable assistance in the effort to conserve North America’s ducks. Information from hunters provides incredible insight into the lives of waterfowl and helps foster a much greater appreciation of the birds we hunt.    1    2       Discussion               |        Related Articles     Duck Banding Facts        1 Related Article: View All                         Table Mountain Outfitters  Cheyenne, WY  Searching Outfitter & Guide directory...

Therefore, it is assumed that if a waterfowl hunter has a lot of bands, he or she has shot a lot of birds. But most of the guys with lanyards full of bands on television will probably tell you they hunted them near banding sites. Some inside information will definately up your odds. Some people can hunt their entire life and never shoot a bird that is banded. Other waterfowl hunters have harvested dozens of banded birds. It all depends on where you hunt and how many birds get banded in your area. However, you could potentially shoot a banded bird anytime, in any location. Each band has a unique number that identifies the species of bird which is tied to the life history. When you call in a band number, an operator will ask you a few simple questions like the date and location of where the bird was harvested. You will receive a certificate in the mail containing your name and information on the banded bird. For most waterfowlers, checking for duck bands is the first thing on their mind when picking up a bird. Along with regular bands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service puts reward bands on some birds. Usually they put these leg bands on adult birds. Reward bands are typically worth any where from 25 to 100 dollars. The government sends you a check only after you report the information regarding the band. Getting paid to hunt, that would be a nice bonus for anyone. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service are not the only ones that band birds. Some hunt clubs put leg bands on birds they release. Pheasants Forever, an organization for the preservation of pheasants, sometimes bands pheasants that they release. Nicknames for leg bands are a common place among my friends. They are often referred to as: jewelry, bling-bling, shine, hardware or leg irons. We refer to hunters who shoot a lot of banded birds as having the force. Roughly 3.1 million leg bands have been reported to date. That is pretty small considering that since 1904 about 58 million birds have been banded in North America. Both of these numbers represent hundreds of different species of birds. Across the nation hunters shoot banded birds every year, in just about every location. They make the hunt just a little bit more memorable and leave the hunter with a little souvenir. The first thing I do when I retrieve a harvested bird is check for a band. I encourage you to do the same. Band information should be reported to 1-800-327-BAND.        Logged  Cut em!

However, band recoveries are not randomly distributed either geographically or by species.  Mallards are far and away the most commonly banded duck.

                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server.  The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:  /etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf    apache2.conf is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.   ports.conf is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.  Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.  They are activated by symlinking available
                           configuration files from their respective
                           *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
                           by using our helpers a2enmod,
                                a2dismod,  a2ensite,
                                a2dissite, and a2enconf,
                                a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information.  The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
                           started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the

What's this big deal?  Are these special birds?  From a particular location?  Some prize from Fish & Game for turning in a band? Thanks in advance for the replies.  I've only been hunting a few years and I'm just trying to understand....     _________________ Benelli - Cordoba (12 ga.) Browning - 725 Sporting (12 ga.)

It's also useful for providing information to biologists for tracking different species and their migration patterns and whatnot.  I'm no expert but this is just my personal estimation from reading about banding birds.  I sure someone else here probably knows a lot more about it.

Not much, but certainly more than we'd otherwise know.  Sometimes the bird was banded thousands of miles away from where it was taken.  Other times, it was banded within the municipality where it was taken. The mystique, I think, is the fact that for all the research and banding that takes place, a relatively small percentage of birds are actually banded, and an even smaller percentage are actually taken.

I wish more would be of the same opinion. Respect for the hunted game before and after the kill.               Top                BBK       Post subject: Re: What's the big deal with "banded" birds?

Sometimes they will have a reward band also, and that is cash in your pocket when you turn the band in. A guy that hunts by me shot a $100 goose last year.

I have hunted waterfowl for over 25 years and have killed one goose band and one duck band. On our place we kill about one band per thousand. Its a big deal to do it.

I found it and there are seven bands.  Each one is a story. I have given two to hunters that also shot at the same bird and another to a kid on his first duck hunt.  I shot the banded drake, but four fell and so I said the banded bird fell on his side so it must have been his. One band I had to send in to Laurel MD.  It was hard to read and very thin.  They did not think I had the number right; it was an  8 your old band and it was put on a duck that was mature.  He was pretty thin and it was late in the season. Many years ago I jumped a bunch of ducks on the river and it was in the days when I did not have a dog.  I had three ducks down, a strong cripple drake, a belly up hen with band floating in the river and a nice drake on the sand bar.  I was able to retrieve the bird on the sandbar. I fell chasing the other drake and broke a metacarpal in my left hand and dislocated two fingers.  I could still the banded bird it had drifted to the other bank.  I had to drive 12 miles to cross a bridge and then walk over a mile to get that banded bird,  but I did what I had to do to get that banded bird.  It was cold enough that I just held my hand out of the window on my way to the emergency room. Sure glad I have had retrievers since that time. Back in the days of the point system.  We passed on a mixed group of divers as there were redheads in the mix. They  landed and then swam in to us. Three redheads got up and ran at us and I could and could see the drake in the middle was  banded.  I said the middle one has a band and I shot.  My partner that day could not believe that I could see the band. Banded birds are useful in studying migration patterns and harvest information.  They help us remember hunts of long ago.  _________________ Spencer "A peculiar virtue in wildlife ethics is that the hunter ordinarily has no gallery to applaud or disapprove of his conduct.

It is a place that used to be a refuge or something and is now just private I believe. I really don't care anyway what the Gamey would have said or done.  The Duck was stone dead and I was going to retrieve a dad bird.  Give me the ticket and I will beat it in court any day.  There are conflicting laws in that case.  it is a law you have to make at least an attempt to recover any downed game wounded or otherwise and that is clearly printed in the literature.  Is the so called made up by the gamey as we go law you cite published in the literature? Plus in my eyes big difference between intentionally doing it and having the bird drop there unintentionally. SO thanks for trying to rain on my parade but I'll still take pride in my 13 year old dog making one hell of a retrieve and it coming back with a band. But nice try.  _________________  "I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more , is none" Bill S.

It was banded in Long Lake Waterfowl Production Area in Sheridan County Montana which is in the NE corner almost in Canada and ND. It was also banded as an adult so was hatched no earlier than 2007. That's at least a thousand miles Amazing to me.  _________________  "I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more , is none" Bill S.

Just don't make your hunts all about bands, you will miss out on a ton of things better            milkfisher   Members Profile  Send Private Message  Find Members Posts  Add to Buddy List   Duckaholic   Senior Antagonizerist Joined: 24 April 2004 Location: United States Status: Offline Points: 6577    Post Options   Post Reply  Quote milkfisher  Report Post   Thanks(0)      Quote  Reply   Posted: 12 January 2012 at 10:48am      Ive got 1 canada, 1 speck, 1 mallard, 1 pintail, and one redhead.  5 total.   BU ive killed like eleventy thousand ducks/geese so its not such a big deal......I mean, Im a big deal, but me having 5 bands isnt a big deal.

Going through a few years of records at a club I hunt with Arkansas the numbers vary greatly year to year.  Some years they will kill a band on average every 300 birds or so, others every 150.  This is out of nearly all mallards.  Some lucky folks average about every 100 or less.            spoonbill   Members Profile  Send Private Message  Find Members Posts  Add to Buddy List   Member   Joined: 24 June 2010 Location: Spring, Tx.

Average 87,000 banded birds harvested a year Progam wide.    As of January 2011 and since 1960*, the BBL has received over 64 million banding records. Since the inception of the North American Bird Banding Program, the BBL has received over 4 million encounter records . On average, over the past decade, the BBL received 1.2 million banding and 87,000 encounter records per year. ( http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/homepage/howmany.cfm )    Fun Fact:  The oldest known waterfowl banded in North America was a Canada goose that lived to be 30 years and 4 months old. The oldest mallard lived to 26 years, 4 months.

In high school I used to hunt near an area where they banded mottleds, but never got one myself. My friends seemed to get like 1 a week for the first month of the season (mottled bands). In the past two season I have killed over 200 birds, but only 2 bands(both wood ducks). One was the only bird killed on the hunt, and the other was one of two birds killed. Don't worry one day luck will cross your path. The feeling of looking down at you first band is like nothing else, and even after 12 the feeling is still the same.    And as oneshot said kill as many redhead hens as you can....seems they band more hens than drakes.

I happen to live close to mottled territory and have killed 2 banded mottled ducks, that were banded in the same area, and I have a couple others from Alberta and South Dakota. It's strictly luck, but if you put the time and effort in you'll get some. Can't get any if you don't shoot birds. Shooting birds = scouting, preparing, and making the best of your hunts.

And the language had best stop.  You're lucky playaxplorer was doing the editing instead of me.  The grown men on this site aren't allowed to use that language, and the kids for darn sure aren't going to be allowed to.    All that said, participate and enjoy the site.  You'll learn a lot and meet some great folks here for sure.         "It's clear I've set the bar for reading comprehension way too high in your case.

Apparently I "Shouldn't be talking to a grown man like that" What the hell is your definition of a grown man? An 18 year old? Or someone like me who has a job, works for his money, buys his own stuff, and self dependent? Respecting elders is over rated, our elders are the people who raised up this crappy generation people who listen to nickel music, smoke weed, get drunk every night and start having sex when they're 10. Its a shame. I say you respect people who respect you, age is just a number.  The older you get, the more you will understand how untrue everything you just said is. You will be amazed at how much you can learn from the guys on here if you would take a step back and listen, not just about duck hunting, but about life in general. No matter how smart you may be, you don't have anywhere near the amount of life experience that someone 20, 30 or 50 years older than you does, and there are a lot of things you can't learn through anything but experience.

This effort includes banding programs from the coast of Louisiana to the plains of the Dakotas to the Arctic breeding grounds of geese and eiders. Every summer, Ducks Unlimited operates waterfowl banding crews at stations in the Prairie Pothole Region of North and South Dakota.      Where Do Your Ducks Come From?

In simple terms, recovery of leg bands helps us to estimate survival probability of banded waterfowl by indicating how many birds died. Not all leg-banded birds that are killed are recovered and reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory because some birds are not retrieved, or if retrieved, are not reported.  This loss of information reduces precision or confidence in an estimate. We can improve precision by increasing both recovery and reporting rates.  Hunting with a well-trained retriever will help reduce crippling loss and therefore improve recovery rates. Calling your band number in to the Bird Banding Laboratory  (800-327-BAND) or reporting your band online will improve reporting rates.

Im 20 years old and have never killed a banded duck, which I hear is not so odd, but whatever.  I've never been on a hunt when a banded duck was taken either.  I would really love to kill a banded duck in my lifetime.  I've heard stories of people killing them or being present when they were killed.  I've seen guys with 2-3 lanyards full of bands and I've seen guys whose lanyard has 1 or 2 bands on it.  Seen both extremes.  I have never really looked into the percentage of ducks they band each year.  Does anyone know the statistics on how many ducks they band a year?? Just curious. Also, just out of curiousity, did anyone kill a banded duck during the first split of duck season?? Post pics if you have them, if not oh well.  And one final thing, lets see how many banded ducks you guys have killed throughout your duck hunting career just out of curiousity, once again, pictures are always good.  Have a great day guys.

We average on a good year 650 ducks and slow year 350 ducks. I've hunted for 23 years so probably been on around 9000 ducks killed and only 7 bands.

I've killed 9 in 29 years......2 of them reward double bands. One for 10$ and one for 100$.......both expired. The one I like the most is this one. Never had seen one before I killed it and at first I thought it was some private operation band or something til I saw the advise bird band written on it &researched it. They put these on the duck when it's on the nest before they can fly or even tell what the sex of the duck is.

I've seen 2 killed while I was hunting. my dad always tells a story of a place called he and his buddies called band point. I dont know the exact number of bands killed but the majority of the ones they killed were from that area. I guess some of it is luck and some of it is statistical. if you hun the middle of the flyway then you will see more killed.

Another guy got the band. I've only ever killed one. I've seen 5 or 6 killed. My uncle has been hunting his whole life and never killed one and he is 60. I've seen two ducks flying with bands and neither one of them were killed. One was a youth hunt and the other was last year on the last day of season after we had already killed our limit and all our guns were unloaded.

I have seen two taken out of the same bunch twice. In the late 1970's, on the upper ouachita NWR in LA our group of 8 or 10 folks took six one morning. Don't remember how many ducks we killed altogether that day, but it was a bunch. I was working for USFWS at the time testing steel shot, and we were not bound by normal limits. I believe there are more killed in the MS flyway than the central or farther west. I did a rough calculation one time, hunting here in SW AR which draws a lot of it's birds from the central flyway - we average about one band for every 1000 or so ducks killed.

SHARE ON:        Keith Sutton  — May 3, 2011            Bands on a hunter’s call lanyard are considered special mementoes of hunts gone by. Photo by Keith Sutton     For waterfowl hunters, duck and goose bands are among the most treasured mementos of the hunt. Killing a banded bird is a special thrill. Wearing a lanyard of bands around your neck is a symbol of status.  The value and importance of waterfowl bands far exceeds that of mere jewelry, however. Hunters who report their bands play a vital role in waterfowl conservation. The reports not only provide interesting insight into the lives of waterfowl, but also hopefully foster a much greater appreciation for our quarry.  Duck Banding  From 1914 through 2007, about 13 million ducks had been banded in North America. The mallard leads the flock, with about 7 million banded. Blue-winged teal are a distant second at more than 1.5 million, followed by pintails and wood ducks (1.3 million), black ducks (1 million) and green-winged teal (500,000).  Not surprisingly, the duck bands most often found on hunters’ lanyards are those found on commonly banded species such as mallards (around 1 million recoveries), black ducks (160,000), pintails (147,000) and wood ducks (140,000). Among the real rarities are the 2,000 or so bands (per species) recovered from cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes and buffleheads. Rarer still are bands from ruddy ducks, long-tailed ducks (oldsquaws) and spectacled eiders. If you have a ruddy duck band, you’re one of only 550 hunters who can make that claim. Only 61 long-tailed duck bands have been recovered, and only 10 spectacled eider bands!  Goose Banding  Canadas are banded far more often than other goose species, with more than 2.8 million banded since 1914. Snow geese rank second at approximately 750,000, followed by white-fronted geese (specklebellies;122,000), black brants (107,000), Ross’s geese (76,000) and Atlantic brants (31,000).  More than 715,000 Canada goose bands have been recovered, 118,000 snow goose bands and 22,000 white-fronted goose bands. Among the real rarities are the 145 bands recovered from 9,500 banded emperor geese. Rarer still are bands from barnacle geese and Hawaiian geese. Should you have a barnacle goose band, it’s one of only nine ever recovered (only 11 barnacle geese have been banded). And only four Hawaiian goose bands have been recovered from the 700-plus birds that have been banded.      A band on the leg of a mallard. Hunters are encouraged to report bands to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Information gathered from bands is essential for developing annual hunting regulations and conservation programs. Credit: Ducks Unlimited     Glad To Be There  Ducks Unlimited biologist Mike Checkett was hunting on the Missouri River in 2003 when one of his hunting partners shot a Canada goose Checkett had banded in 1997.  Gator Food  A band placed on the leg of a pintail in Canada’s Northwest Territories was recovered from the stomach of an American alligator in Florida’s Orange Lake 13 months later.  Against All Odds  Dr. Stan Chace of Alturas, Calif., seemingly defied all odds in the fall of 1962. Chace bagged a banded Canada goose in October, and shot another banded Canada in December. When he compared the bands, Chace found them to be consecutively numbered — the first 518-31661 and the second 518-31662. The birds were banded three years earlier.  Duck Dogs  In the 1950s, biologists used retrievers to catch young mallards for banding on the nesting grounds in Canada.  Feeling Trapped  One black duck drake was captured 18 times during a nine-year span in Michigan Department of Conservation banding traps. An adult when first trapped and banded in 1949, the duck successfully eluded hunters and wildlife predators for 10 years. Caught in a trap on January 31, 1958, the bird’s original leg band, which was worn thin with age, was replaced.  Marathon Flyer Enjoys Travel      A happy hunter with a banded goose. Credit: Ducks Unlimited     A pintail banded on September 2, 1940, in Athabasca County of northern Alberta eluded hazards until January 1954 when it was shot near Naucuspana, Mexico. Considering the 3,000 miles between band site and death, and assuming the bird made the two-way migration each year for 13 years, the pintail would have logged nearly 80,000 migration miles during its lifetime.  Hitting The Jackpot  Acquiring one bird band a season is great. But how about two, on consecutive shots, on the same day? That’s what happened to Howard Ewart on November 23, 1996, when he shot a pair of banded mallard drakes while hunting on Wyoming’s Big Horn River. Also living a charmed existence was Jack Needles, who, on December 24, 1992, bagged a banded black duck drake and a banded mallard hen in New Jersey. The birds arrived as a pair.  Age Records  Information on life span is collected every time a banded bird is reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. And the record ages for some waterfowl species might surprise you.  •	Canada goose, 33 years, 3 months  •	Canvasback, 29 years, 6 months  •	Lesser snow goose, 27 years, 6 months  •	Black duck, 26 years, 5 months  •	Mallard 26 years, 4 months  •	Greater white-fronted goose, 23 years, 6 months  •	Blue-winged teal, 23 years, 3 months  •	Redhead, 22 years, 7 months  •	Ross’s goose, 22 years, 6 months  •	Wood duck, 22 years, 6 months    CATEGORIES:  Alligators Bird Hunting Waterfowl        Next post Retailing Longevity: How Does It Happen?

Anybody?         “For us hunting wasn’t a sport. It was a way to be intimate with nature, that intimacy providing us with wild unprocessed food free from pesticides and hormones and with the bonus of having been produced without the addition of great quantities of fossil fuel. In addition, hunting provided us with an ever scarcer relationship in a world of cities, factory farms, and agribusiness, direct responsibility for taking the lives that sustained us. Lives that even vegans indirectly take as the growing and harvesting of organic produce kills deer, birds, snakes, rodents, and insects. We lived close to the animals we ate. We knew their habits and that knowledge deepened our thanks to them and the land that made them.”  Ted Kerasote   ​     NCWaterfowler ,  Jan 16, 2006      NCWaterfowler ,  Jan 16, 2006     #1           Jan 16, 2006    #2            WWR  Elite Refuge Member      Messages:  17,026    Joined:  Mar 30, 2005    Location:  No gano...pero como me divierto, TX          I heard it was 1 out of 100...

They must be pretty good odds I would say.  Five guys here including myself that hunt everyday have killed 9 fed banded ducks, 7 NC waterfowl banded mallard trash, and 4 banded canadas.  This is a below average year for the bands here.  I will be interested to see some numbers.

There have been seasons where I have killed in excess of 250 birds and no bands.  There has been one season where between 4 of us we killed over 500 mallards and not one single band.

I hunt areas in Canada where they band ducks and we do well there. I have gotten banded birds in other states too during the migration.  So,, I say location has a bunch to do with it,,, and a little luck.

More mallards equal more bands...I got 4 bands on 111 ducks one year...this year zero for 88!      P.S. I'm not a professional guide, it's just a nickname a friend gave me.

In coastal Texas where I hunt these happen to be the least harvest waterfowl so the odds here are very slim.  In 20 years of waterfowl hunting I have been the party that killed a banded redhead and a banded mottled duck.  So the odds down here are probably closer to 1 in 1000.      Remember the good ole days..... 39 days and 3 ducks?

We see a lot of hybridization here.  It would be really interesting to see the pictures of each duck as well, to see what the ducks actually look like and how they were categorized.  That came out wrong, I do know what a duck actually looks like...but you know what I mean hehe.  Often a black here will have traces of green, a mallard hen might have an olive black duck bill, etc         FullandFuller ,  Feb 10, 2010      FullandFuller ,  Feb 10, 2010     #2           Feb 10, 2010    #3            bearhunter  Elite Refuge Member      Messages:  4,306    Joined:  Jan 8, 2005    Location:  On the X, VA          They can be a neat looking bird.

There isn't a problem right now, currently Blacks and Mallards occupy some of the same niches - hence the hybrids. People are worried that the Black Duck species will eventually be bred out by the Mallards.  I might be inclined to agree, but it is going to take a while.  Something else, a lot of folks don't know how to count them (hybrids) in their daily bag limit, problem is neither do some Conservation Officers.

Marina mallards, urban park ducks etc. are infiltratin the local blackduck gene pool. As more and more mallards become resident park ducks in all the urban sprawl that is on the east coast the resident blacks are gonna be in trouble. just my opinion..I believe the waterfowl landscape in the AF has evolved into a partially domesticated urban population of resident canadas and mallards for alot of areas..particularly along the coast where there is always open water and a ton of unhuntable areas.

I see birds all year...but then again...when i visit my parents in NC...what do I see in the summer down there??  canada geese and mallards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I havent read anything on the findings of the radio fitted birds...  for sure there are a lot of blacks that breed in new england states...  but the majority of the coastal birds wintering here come from the canadian coastal states, from what i have heard....  you could probably find some banding info on blacks shot in ct , and see where most are banded...  bob      we constantly, dont do things that way     Bob Johnson ,  Feb 11, 2010      Bob Johnson ,  Feb 11, 2010     #9           Feb 11, 2010    #10            FullandFuller  Elite Refuge Member      Messages:  1,233    Joined:  Dec 8, 2005    Location:  PA          The blacks and hybrids we kill are not local birds as far as I can tell.

We usually hunt just east of Dallas but we have gone for geese down on the coast and up in the panhandle a couple of times and we have even hunted a small amount out in East Texas.  Over the past 20 years we figured we had probably shot more than 1,500 ducks and geese and we have NEVER even seen a band!  Most of what we shoot are gadwalls, widgeon, green wings, early season blue wings and (before we got smart and started passing on them) way too many ringnecks.  (You can only eat so much gumbo!)  We have nailed exactly ONE canvasback, TWO pintail, and not all that many more mallards during this same period of time although between the two of us we usually average about 6 ducks per trip.  I won't even try and tell you how many dove we have shot during this same period of time and there have been no bands there either.  I guess it depends a bit on where you hunt, and like I said we hunt ALMOST exclusively 20 miles from Dallas.  Any other contenders for this record?  PS  My buddy thought our number should be somewhere north of 2,000 ducks.

I have been hunting waterfowl for over 40 years and have only shot one banded Honker.  Last year I took my cousin's 11-year-old son out for his first duck hunt.  He only shot one time and downed a banded bull Sprig.  Go figure!

I have read things though, saying roughly 1 in 160 (dont quote me here i am just remembering) mallards were banded. Mallards being the majority of birds that are banded, so if you shoot exclusively mallards you have a better chance. 2nd most banded, blue wing teal I think.  That being said, i have killed at least a dozen goose bands, like the guy said earlier, they band alot where I hunt.

Alot have been mottled ducks couple Bluewings one gw and a mallard and a fulvouse whistling duck. I hunt a lot and we kill a lot of birds. My cousin that I hunt with a lot hasnt killed a banded bird in several years...just luck of the draw I guess. I was lucky enough to kill a double banded mottle duck a couple years ago and made 100 bucks. Last year in that same spot produced 8 bands, I didn't kill any of them but it was a hot spot. Now my dad on the other hand has the luck of the Irish...he usually makes one or two hunts a year and gets a band.      Consider it DONE!

First duck i shot this year which is the first duck my young dog retrieved was a banded drake mallard. So i guess i have to shoot alot more ducks to get another.

But i hunted many years without a single band. Seems like when i first started hunting in 1972 i hunted about 15 years without a band. I must have shot 700 ducks in that time frame with  no bands.  I have several since then.  And i have had one each of the last 3 seasons. It seems to me that where you hunt and what type of birds you shoot has a lot to do with it.  And i am guessing that they band more now then years ago.  Joe      A bad day hunting beats a good day at work. Why whould anybody from the Phillippines buy a Japanese car?

I'm bored, I figured it out...  Discussion in ' Washington Flyway Forum ' started by Harliduck , Mar 30, 2006 .

Now, this does not figure into areas that have high banding studies, like certain lakes and such we know has a lot of bands, just some seriously average amounts based on the numbers (I crunch numbers at work way too much, fun to do with waterfowl). So.....here we go- and remember, most of this is hogwash and luck still has most of the factor!   Canvasback  1 Band for every 1,112 Harvests   Mallard  1 Band for every 117 Harvests        .   GreenWing Teal  1 Band for every 1,249 Harvests   American Wigeon  1 Band for every 1,382 Harvests   Redhead  1 Band for every 198 Harvests   Scaup (Both Together)  1 Band for every 1,688 Harvests   Harlequin  1 Band for every 11 Harvests   Pintail  1 Band for every 342 Harvests   Shoveler  1 Band for every 10,032 Harvests   Gadwall  1 Band for every 2,592 Harvests   Barrows Goldeneye  1 Band for every 62 Harvests   Hooded Merganser  1 Band for every 1,312 Harvests   Snow Goose (All Species Lumped Together)  1 Band for every 934 Harvests   Canada Goose (All Species Lumped Together)  1 Band for every 98 Harvests   Brant Goose (All Species Lumped Together)  1 Band for every 13 Harvests     Some are small because of low Harvest rates and high level of studies. I thought it was pretty interesting while doing the math...I can figure out any species, anything else you may want to see???

Extremely low banding, very few recoveries, and a substancial poplulation...kind of interesting....

Yikes on the Buffs.....didn't Toby get one? Now that is special...  dmarks....I will be honest...I am going to try and deflect some of the off season bickering here with some hopefully interesting, mostly nonsensical, posts. Probably more to keep me interested as well.  Anyways, these numbers are pretty much based on total averages, so in a perfect world for these to be 100% accurate they would have to band the same amount every year for 50 years. Obviously that is far from accurate, but hopefully the law of averages takes over and this can be somewhat close. Take Harlequins, some years if the studies are in full swing, it can run 50%, right now it is really low as most of the WA studies are long gone and most bands are coming from Canada and Oregon. Lots of species fluctuate...so take these as long term averages...it is funny how they really can be applied to my harvests...

Can't we just all get along     Now back to your thread.  I can really appreciate what you have done.  I have asked this question before and was somewhat surprised by the response I got from those in the waterfowl bio world.  Still, I think what you have done, albeit rough and perhaps flawed is a great stab at it.  I suspect using the law of averages is good because you would also have to factor in natural mortality, predation, and other events that lead to death other than by gun.  So perhaps by averaging the highs and lows of banding compenstes for other mortality related issues that are not in your equation (though honestly I doubt it).  Great job and very interesting.

SHARE ON:        Keith Sutton  — May 3, 2011            Bands on a hunter’s call lanyard are considered special mementoes of hunts gone by. Photo by Keith Sutton     For waterfowl hunters, duck and goose bands are among the most treasured mementos of the hunt. Killing a banded bird is a special thrill. Wearing a lanyard of bands around your neck is a symbol of status.  The value and importance of waterfowl bands far exceeds that of mere jewelry, however. Hunters who report their bands play a vital role in waterfowl conservation. The reports not only provide interesting insight into the lives of waterfowl, but also hopefully foster a much greater appreciation for our quarry.  Duck Banding  From 1914 through 2007, about 13 million ducks had been banded in North America. The mallard leads the flock, with about 7 million banded. Blue-winged teal are a distant second at more than 1.5 million, followed by pintails and wood ducks (1.3 million), black ducks (1 million) and green-winged teal (500,000).  Not surprisingly, the duck bands most often found on hunters’ lanyards are those found on commonly banded species such as mallards (around 1 million recoveries), black ducks (160,000), pintails (147,000) and wood ducks (140,000). Among the real rarities are the 2,000 or so bands (per species) recovered from cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes and buffleheads. Rarer still are bands from ruddy ducks, long-tailed ducks (oldsquaws) and spectacled eiders. If you have a ruddy duck band, you’re one of only 550 hunters who can make that claim. Only 61 long-tailed duck bands have been recovered, and only 10 spectacled eider bands!  Goose Banding  Canadas are banded far more often than other goose species, with more than 2.8 million banded since 1914. Snow geese rank second at approximately 750,000, followed by white-fronted geese (specklebellies;122,000), black brants (107,000), Ross’s geese (76,000) and Atlantic brants (31,000).  More than 715,000 Canada goose bands have been recovered, 118,000 snow goose bands and 22,000 white-fronted goose bands. Among the real rarities are the 145 bands recovered from 9,500 banded emperor geese. Rarer still are bands from barnacle geese and Hawaiian geese. Should you have a barnacle goose band, it’s one of only nine ever recovered (only 11 barnacle geese have been banded). And only four Hawaiian goose bands have been recovered from the 700-plus birds that have been banded.      A band on the leg of a mallard. Hunters are encouraged to report bands to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Information gathered from bands is essential for developing annual hunting regulations and conservation programs. Credit: Ducks Unlimited     Glad To Be There  Ducks Unlimited biologist Mike Checkett was hunting on the Missouri River in 2003 when one of his hunting partners shot a Canada goose Checkett had banded in 1997.  Gator Food  A band placed on the leg of a pintail in Canada’s Northwest Territories was recovered from the stomach of an American alligator in Florida’s Orange Lake 13 months later.  Against All Odds  Dr. Stan Chace of Alturas, Calif., seemingly defied all odds in the fall of 1962. Chace bagged a banded Canada goose in October, and shot another banded Canada in December. When he compared the bands, Chace found them to be consecutively numbered — the first 518-31661 and the second 518-31662. The birds were banded three years earlier.  Duck Dogs  In the 1950s, biologists used retrievers to catch young mallards for banding on the nesting grounds in Canada.  Feeling Trapped  One black duck drake was captured 18 times during a nine-year span in Michigan Department of Conservation banding traps. An adult when first trapped and banded in 1949, the duck successfully eluded hunters and wildlife predators for 10 years. Caught in a trap on January 31, 1958, the bird’s original leg band, which was worn thin with age, was replaced.  Marathon Flyer Enjoys Travel      A happy hunter with a banded goose. Credit: Ducks Unlimited     A pintail banded on September 2, 1940, in Athabasca County of northern Alberta eluded hazards until January 1954 when it was shot near Naucuspana, Mexico. Considering the 3,000 miles between band site and death, and assuming the bird made the two-way migration each year for 13 years, the pintail would have logged nearly 80,000 migration miles during its lifetime.  Hitting The Jackpot  Acquiring one bird band a season is great. But how about two, on consecutive shots, on the same day? That’s what happened to Howard Ewart on November 23, 1996, when he shot a pair of banded mallard drakes while hunting on Wyoming’s Big Horn River. Also living a charmed existence was Jack Needles, who, on December 24, 1992, bagged a banded black duck drake and a banded mallard hen in New Jersey. The birds arrived as a pair.  Age Records  Information on life span is collected every time a banded bird is reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. And the record ages for some waterfowl species might surprise you.  •	Canada goose, 33 years, 3 months  •	Canvasback, 29 years, 6 months  •	Lesser snow goose, 27 years, 6 months  •	Black duck, 26 years, 5 months  •	Mallard 26 years, 4 months  •	Greater white-fronted goose, 23 years, 6 months  •	Blue-winged teal, 23 years, 3 months  •	Redhead, 22 years, 7 months  •	Ross’s goose, 22 years, 6 months  •	Wood duck, 22 years, 6 months    CATEGORIES:  Alligators Bird Hunting Waterfowl        Next post Retailing Longevity: How Does It Happen?

To report a band, go to ReportBand.gov  In 1902, Dr. Paul Bartsch of the Smithsonian Institution was the first to band birds in North America - 23 black-crowned night herons near Washington, D.C. Many banders followed, and banding and recovery records have been kept since 1914.  The first large-scale North American banding program was established in 1922.  Through 2007, about 16 million waterfowl have been banded in North America, including about 13 million ducks.  Biologists band more than 200,000 ducks and nearly 150,000 geese and swans in North America each year.  About 85,000-90,000 bands are reported each year.  Through 2009, most duck banding efforts have focused on mallards. The mallard is the most commonly banded and most commonly harvested duck in the United States and Canada. Approximately 7 million mallards have been banded through 2007.  The oldest known waterfowl banded in North America was a Canada goose that lived to be 30 years and 4 months old. The oldest mallard lived to 26 years, 4 months.

The same individual, an adult Fringilla coelebs, had been caught again in the same area last year in Lesvos, Greece    Bird ringing or bird banding is the attachment of a small, individually numbered metal or plastic tag to the leg or wing of a wild bird to enable individual identification. This helps in keeping track of the movements of the bird and its life history. It is common to take measurements and examine conditions of feather molt, subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex during capture for ringing. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration , longevity, mortality, population, territoriality , feeding behavior , and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists . Other methods of marking birds may also be used to allow for field based identification that does not require capture.

One instance occurred during the Punic Wars: In 218 BC a crow was released by a besieged garrison (which suggests that this was an established practice). Quintus Fabius Pictor used a thread on the bird's leg to send a message back. In another instance, a knight interested in chariot races during the time of Pliny (AD 1) took crows to Volterra, 135 miles (217 km) away and released them with information on the race winners. [2]  Falconers in the Middle Ages would fit plates on their falcons with seals of their owners. From around 1560 or so, swans were marked with a swan mark , a nick on the bill. [3] [4]  Storks injured by arrows (termed as pfeilstorch in German) traceable to African tribes were found in Germany in 1822 and constituted some of the earliest evidence of long distance migration in European birds. [5]  In North America John James Audubon and Ernest Thompson Seton were pioneers although their method of marking birds was different from modern ringing. In order to determine if the same bird would return to his farm, Audubon tied silver threads onto the legs of young eastern phoebes in 1803, while Seton marked snow buntings in Manitoba with ink in 1882. [6] Ringing of birds for more extensive scientific purposes was started in 1899 by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen , a Danish schoolteacher, using aluminum rings on European starlings (Mortensen had tried using zinc rings as early as 1890 but found these were too heavy). [7] The first banding scheme was established in Germany by Johannes Thienemann in 1903 at the Rossitten Bird Observatory on the Baltic Coast of East Prussia. This was followed by Hungary in 1908, Great Britain in 1909 (by Arthur Landsborough Thomson in Aberdeen and Harry Witherby in England ), Yugoslavia [ clarification needed ] in 1910 and the Scandinavian countries between 1911 and 1914. [8]  Paul Bartsch of the Smithsonian Institution is credited with the first modern banding in the U.S.: he banded 23 black-crowned night herons in 1902. [9] [10] [11]  Leon J. Cole of the University of Wisconsin founded the American Bird Banding Association in 1909; this organization oversaw banding until the establishment of federal programs in the U.S. (1920) and Canada (1923) pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1918. [11]  Terminology and techniques [ edit ]     A banded ruby-crowned kinglet recaptured in a mist net    Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the USA and Australia. Organised ringing efforts are called ringing or banding schemes, and the organisations that run them are ringing or banding authorities. (Birds are ringed rather than rung ) Those who ring or band birds are known as ringers or banders, and they are typically active at ringing or banding stations.  Birds may be captured by being taken as young birds at the nest , or as adults, captured in fine mist nets , baited traps, Heligoland traps , drag nets, cannon nets , or by other methods. Raptors may be caught by many methods, including bal-chatri traps.  When a bird is caught, a ring of suitable size (usually made of aluminium or other lightweight material) is attached to the bird's leg, and has on it a unique number, as well as a contact address. The bird is often weighed and measured, examined for data relevant to the ringer's project, and then released. The rings are very light, and are designed to have no adverse effect on the birds – indeed, the whole basis of using ringing to gain data about the birds is that ringed birds should behave in all respects in the same way as the unringed population. The birds so tagged can then be identified when they are re-trapped, or found dead, later.  When a ringed bird is found, and the ring number read and reported back to the ringer or ringing authority, this is termed a ringing recovery or control [ citation needed ] . The finder can contact the address on the ring, give the unique number, and be told the known history of the bird's movements. Some national ringing/banding authorities also accept reports by phone or on official web sites.  The organising body, by collating many such reports, can then determine patterns of bird movements for large populations. Non-ringing/banding scientists can also obtain data for use in bird-related research.     A yellow-throated fulvetta with a numbered aluminum ring on its left tarsus    At times in North America, the bands have just a unique number (without an address) that is recorded along with other identifying information on the bird. If the bird is recaptured the number on the band is recorded (along with other identifying characteristics) as a retrap . All band numbers and information on the individual birds are then entered into a database and the information often shared throughout North American banding operations. This way information on retrapped birds is more readily available and easy to access.  Equipment used in bird banding [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (February 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Introduction [ edit ]  When deciding on bird banding equipment one must decide what species of bird they’d like to focus on. Many of the supplies used during an operation are determined by how big a bird is. The essential equipment includes a bird identification guide, mist nets, banding pliers, leg gauge, wing ruler, and a digital scale. However, before starting a bird banding operation a permit is necessary to purchase all of the equipment. This will then be taken into consideration that all the equipment purchased must be made to last, be efficient, safe on the birds, and easy for anyone to use.  Mist net [ edit ]  Mist net come in a variety of sizes and lengths according to the bird’s size. All nets are made from a black nylon material and come with 4 shelves to catch the birds once they fly into the net. When purchasing a mist-net for sparrows the height usually stays the same at 2.7 meters but varies in width at 6 meters to 18 meters at a 30mm mesh. Determining net size for large sparrows to jays are 2.6 meters high and varying in widths at 6 meters to 18 meters at a 38mm mesh. If the study requires the banding of large owls a specific net is required and it is made with a heavier material to withstand the talons of the owl at 60mm mesh. Banding hawks also requires a heavier material at 100mm or 127mm mesh. However, some nets for larger birds include an additional shelve at 5 instead of 4. [12]  Banding Pliers [ edit ]  Banding pliers are an essential tool that helps place the band around a bird’s leg. These pliers come in different sizes as determined by how wide a bird’s leg is. Pliers are sized between 0A-1A, 2–3, and 3B, 3A, and 4. [13]  Leg Gauge [ edit ]  The band size is determined by using the leg gauge. A leg gauge is placed around the bird’s leg which determines the circumference of the leg. After identifying the size of a band it is then placed on around the leg with the help from the banding pliers. [12] In Australia, band size range from 1 to 15, plus special sizes for birds whose leg shapes require special bands, such as parrots and pelicans. [14]  Wing Ruler [ edit ]  When looking through the Pyle textbook some birds can be identified by the wing cord. The next essential piece of equipment is the wing ruler, which is used to determine the length of the wing for data collection, research purposes, or determining species. [12]  Digital Scale [ edit ]  Once the processing of the bird’s morphology has been completed the last piece of equipment used is a digital scale. This helps with determining the weight of the bird. This is the last step before releasing the bird. [12]  Limitations [ edit ]  Certain bird species are for various reasons unsuitable for ringing. In some countries, such as Australia, there exist laws prohibiting banding of such species. [14]  Many very large birds, such as ratites , flamingos and the largest swans , are extremely difficult to band because the cost of making a band which is capable of securely fitting their strong, heavy legs is prohibitive. At the other extreme, the smaller species of river and tree kingfishers , todies and certain lories , have such narrow tarsii that no band can be securely placed around it without imposing danger to blood circulation. With some gamebirds, such as the Indian Peafowl , spurs on the legs interfere with the bands, which thus can cause injury to the birds.  Many species of cockatoo – which even if able to be banded require special bands to fit the unique shape of their legs – will crush bands with their powerful bills and claws. [15] The ability to overcome this problem varies between species, and with some such as the Gang-gang cockatoo , it is known to be too dangerous to attempt banding. New World vultures also cannot be banded on their legs because they urinate onto their legs, causing corrosion of the bands into a powdery oxide that sticks to the vulture’s leg and injures the bird. Dippers are also dangerously handicapped by ringing because the rings induce drag that makes it extremely difficult for them to catch prey in fast-flowing water.  Among species which can be safely ringed, there are major limitations among nomadic species of the deserts of the Eastern Hemisphere and cardueline finches of the taiga . The highly unpredictable movements inherent in these species’ lifestyles means that recovery rates are extremely low, [16] [17] especially given generally low population densities within their habitats.  Similar schemes [ edit ]  Wing tags [ edit ]     This female great frigatebird has been tagged with wing tags as part of a breeding study    In some surveys, involving larger birds such as eagles, brightly coloured plastic tags are attached to birds' wing feathers. Each has a letter or letters, and the combination of colour and letters uniquely identifies the bird. These can then be read in the field, through binoculars, meaning that there is no need to re-trap the birds. Because the tags are attached to feathers, they drop off when the bird moults .  Another method is imping in a brightly colored false feather instead of a natural feather. [18]  A patagial tag is a permanent tag held onto the wing by a rivet punched through the patagium . [19]  Radio transmitters and satellite-tracking [ edit ]  Where detailed information is needed on individual movements, tiny radio transmitters can be fitted on to birds. For small species the transmitter is carried as a 'backpack' fitted over the wing bases, and for larger species it may be attached to a tail feather or looped to the legs. Both types usually have a tiny (10 cm) flexible aerial to improve signal reception. Two field receivers (reading distance and direction) are needed to establish the bird's position using triangulation from the ground. The technique is useful for tracing individuals during landscape-level movements particularly in dense vegetation (such as tropical forests) and for shy or difficult-to-spot species, because birds can be located from a distance without visual confirmation. [20] [21]  The use of satellite transmitters for bird movements is currently restricted by transmitter size – to species larger than about 400g. They may be attached to migratory birds (geese, swans, cranes, penguins etc.) or other species such as penguins that undertake long-distance movements. Individuals may be tracked by satellites for immense distances, for the lifetime of the transmitter battery. As with wing tags, the transmitters may be designed to drop off when the bird moults; or they may be recovered by recapturing the bird. [22] [23]  Field-readable rings [ edit ]     A colour-ringed herring gull    A field-readable is a ring or rings, usually made from plastic and brightly coloured, which may also have conspicuous markings in the form of letters and/or numbers. They are used by biologists working in the field to identify individual birds without recapture and with a minimum of disturbance to their behaviour. Rings large enough to carry numbers are usually restricted to larger birds, although if necessary small extensions to the rings (leg flags) bearing the identification code allow their use on slightly smaller species. For small species (e.g. most passerines), individuals can be identified by using a combination of small rings of different colours, which are read in a specific order. Most colour-marks of this type are considered temporary (the rings degrade, fade and may be lost or removed by the birds) and individuals are usually also fitted with a permanent metal ring.  Leg-flags [ edit ]  Similar to coloured rings or bands are leg-flags, usually made of Darvic and used in addition to numbered metal bands. Although leg-flags may sometimes have individual codes on them, their more usual use is to code for the sites where the birds were banded in order to elucidate their migration routes and staging areas. The use of colour-coded leg-flags is part of an international program, originated in Australia in 1990, by the countries of the East Asian - Australasian Flyway to identify important areas and routes used by migratory waders . [24]  Other markers [ edit ]  Head and neck markers are very visible, and may be used in species where the legs are not normally visible (such as ducks and geese). Nasal discs and nasal saddles can be attached to the culmen with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils . They should not be used if they obstruct breathing. They should not be used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. [25]  Neck collars made of expandable, non-heat-conducting plastic are very useful for larger birds such as geese. [26]  Bird ringing and education [ edit ]  Many institutions that ring birds offer demonstrations for the public, where experts ring live birds while highlighting the steps of the process and answering questions from the public. [27] Educating visitors about the technique helps to spread accurate information about it to the public. [28] While live bird ringing is not the only method of educating the public on bird conservation, it can be an especially engaging and unique method for visitors. [29]  Some results [ edit ]     Ringed Larus ridibundus in flight    Ringing activities are often regulated by national agencies but because ringed birds may be found across countries, there are consortiums that ensure that recoveries and reports are collated. In the UK, bird ringing is organized by the British Trust for Ornithology . In North America the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory collaborates with Canadian programs and since 1996, partners with the North American Banding Council (NABC). [30] The European Union for Bird Ringing (EURING) consolidates ringing data from the various national programs in Europe. [31] In Australia, the Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme manages all bird and bat ringing information. [32] while SAFRING manages bird ringing activities in South Africa. [33] Bird ringing in India is managed by the Bombay Natural History Society . The National Center for Bird Conservation (CEMAVE) coordinates a national scheme for bird ringing in Brazil.

Duck hunters are encouraged to report duck bands to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Information gathered from duck bands is essential for developing annual hunting regulations and conservation programs.  Colored second duck bands with no dollar amount are visual markers used by researchers who want to identify ducks at a distance. These should be reported along with regular duck band numbers. Why Band Ducks? When a duck is fitted with a band, the bander records where and when the bird is banded, how old it is, what sex it is and other information. Those records then are sent to the Bird Banding Laboratory where they are entered into a computer database. If a duck band is later reported, scientists can use the information to learn more about a species.  During the earliest days of duck banding, researchers simply wanted to know more about duck migration. But today, duck band returns also provide information about a species’ abundance, distribution, numbers, life span, causes of death and more. Data from banded ducks are used to monitor population levels, assess the effects of environmental disturbances and address concerns such as bird hazards at airports and crop depredations. Results from duck banding studies also support national and international conservation programs such as the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. Each year, biologists thoroughly analyze band returns and use the information to assess duck hunting pressure, estimate productivity and survival, and measure the vulnerability of the age/sex classes to hunting pressure. This information is essential for developing the duck hunting regulations each of us must follow to assure duck populations aren’t harmed by overharvest.  To determine duck band reporting rates, researchers periodically band ducks with standard (silver) and reward (colored) bands offering various dollar amounts to those who report reward bands.  Duck-Banding Facts Biologists band more than 200,000 ducks each year, with information recovered for large numbers of those birds. In 2001, for example, 222,006 ducks were banded and 48,576 bands recovered. Through 2007, about 13 million ducks had been banded in North America. The Mallard leads the flock, with about 7 million banded. Blue-Winged Teal are a distant second at more than 1.5 million, followed by pintails and wood ducks (1.3 million), Black Ducks (1 million) and Green-Winged Teal (500,000). The most commonly banded diving duck is the Lesser Scaup at 350,000 plus. Redheads (270,000), canvasbacks (160,000) and Ring-Necked Ducks (155,000) are next on the list. The black scoter is near the bottom of the list, with only about 340 banded to date. The remoteness of the Black Scoter’s breeding range in northern Canada and Alaska has made it difficult for waterfowl biologists to capture and band this species. Ducks almost never banded include masked ducks (3) and tufted ducks (2).  Not surprisingly, the duck bands most often found on duck hunters’ lanyards are those found on commonly banded species such as Mallards (around 1 million recoveries), Black Ducks (160,000), Pintails (147,000) and Wood Ducks (140,000). Among the real rarities are the 2,000 or so bands (per species) recovered from Cinnamon Teal, Common Goldeneyes and Buffleheads. Rarer still are bands from Ruddy Ducks, Long-Tailed Ducks and Spectacled Eiders. If you have a Ruddy Duck band, you’re one of only 550 duck hunters who can make that claim. Only 61 Long-Tailed duck bands have been recovered, and only 10 Spectacled Eider bands! Reporting A Duck Band Of the more than 1 million birds banded each year in North America, 87 percent of all recoveries reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory are from waterfowl. Surprisingly, however, of all the banded birds killed by duck hunters, only 30 to 40 percent are reported. Given the tremendous cost associated with the banding effort and the reliance on duck banding as an essential management and research tool, the loss of data associated with this low band-reporting rate is regrettable. Any band you recover is yours to keep, and reporting information is easy. To report a band via the Internet, visit www.reportband.gov. To report a band by telephone, you can call toll-free to 1-800-327-BAND (2263) from anywhere in Canada, the United States and most parts of the Caribbean.  Information needed for a report includes the duck band number; how, when and where the duck band was found; and the name and address of the person reporting the duck band. About three to four weeks after you submit a report, you’ll receive a certificate of appreciation from the Bird Banding Lab and basic banding information about the bird you are reporting, including the state or province where the bird was banded, the date it was banded and the species. Sometimes duck hunters find very old duck bands with the numbers worn and unreadable. The numbers on these duck bands still can be determined by a process called etching if the hunter sends the band to the Bird Banding Lab, 12100 Beech Forest Rd., Laurel, MD 20708-4037. Hundreds of bands are etched and returned to hunters every year.  Frederick Lincoln with the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey was a key player in early efforts to develop a system for banding ducks and other birds in the U.S.  Duck Band Trivia  While duck hunting in Missouri, biologist George Brakhage killed a gadwall he had banded several weeks earlier in North Dakota.  A duck band placed on the leg of a Pintail in Canada’s Northwest Territories was recovered from the stomach of an American alligator in Florida’s Orange Lake 13 months later.  One Black Duck Drake was captured 18 times during a nine-year span in the waterfowl banding traps of the Michigan Department of Conservation. An adult when first trapped and banded in 1949, the duck successfully eluded hunters and wildlife predators for 10 years. Caught in a trap on January 31, 1958, the bird’s original leg band, which was worn thin with age, was replaced.  A Pintail banded on September 2, 1940, in Athabasca County of northern Alberta eluded hazards until January 1954 when it was shot near Naucuspana, Tabasco, Mexico. Considering the 3,000 miles between band site and death, and assuming the bird made the two-way migration each year for 13 years, the Pintail would have logged nearly 80,000 migration miles during its lifetime.  Acquiring one bird band a season ranks right up there. But how about two, on consecutive shots, on the same day? That’s what happened to Howard Ewart on November 23, 1996, when he shot a pair of Mallard Drakes (1007-31302) and (1337-79713) while hunting on the Big Horn River near Thermopolis, Wyoming. Also living a charmed existence was Jack Needles, who, on December 24, 1992, bagged a drake black duck (1287-82810) and a hen mallard (1287-82870) near Stone Harbor, New Jersey. The birds arrived as a pair.   Age Records Information on life span is collected every time a banded bird is reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. And the record ages for some duck species may surprise you.  Canvasback, 29 years, 6 months  Mallard 27 years, 7 months  Black duck, 26 years, 5 months  Blue-winged Teal, 23 years, 3 months  Redhead, 22 years, 7 months  Wood Duck, 22 years, 6 months  Pintail, 22 years, 3 months  American Wigeon, 21 years, 4 months  Ring-Necked Duck, 20 years, 5 months  Green-Winged Teal, 20 years, 3 months  Duck Banding Conclusion As you can see, the value and importance of duck bands far exceeds that of mere jewelry. Duck hunters who harvest birds and report their bands provide invaluable assistance in the effort to conserve North America’s ducks. Information from hunters provides incredible insight into the lives of waterfowl and helps foster a much greater appreciation of the birds we hunt.    1    2       Discussion               |        Related Articles     Duck Banding Facts        1 Related Article: View All                         Table Mountain Outfitters  Cheyenne, WY  Searching Outfitter & Guide directory...

Therefore, it is assumed that if a waterfowl hunter has a lot of bands, he or she has shot a lot of birds. But most of the guys with lanyards full of bands on television will probably tell you they hunted them near banding sites. Some inside information will definately up your odds. Some people can hunt their entire life and never shoot a bird that is banded. Other waterfowl hunters have harvested dozens of banded birds. It all depends on where you hunt and how many birds get banded in your area. However, you could potentially shoot a banded bird anytime, in any location. Each band has a unique number that identifies the species of bird which is tied to the life history. When you call in a band number, an operator will ask you a few simple questions like the date and location of where the bird was harvested. You will receive a certificate in the mail containing your name and information on the banded bird. For most waterfowlers, checking for duck bands is the first thing on their mind when picking up a bird. Along with regular bands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service puts reward bands on some birds. Usually they put these leg bands on adult birds. Reward bands are typically worth any where from 25 to 100 dollars. The government sends you a check only after you report the information regarding the band. Getting paid to hunt, that would be a nice bonus for anyone. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service are not the only ones that band birds. Some hunt clubs put leg bands on birds they release. Pheasants Forever, an organization for the preservation of pheasants, sometimes bands pheasants that they release. Nicknames for leg bands are a common place among my friends. They are often referred to as: jewelry, bling-bling, shine, hardware or leg irons. We refer to hunters who shoot a lot of banded birds as having the force. Roughly 3.1 million leg bands have been reported to date. That is pretty small considering that since 1904 about 58 million birds have been banded in North America. Both of these numbers represent hundreds of different species of birds. Across the nation hunters shoot banded birds every year, in just about every location. They make the hunt just a little bit more memorable and leave the hunter with a little souvenir. The first thing I do when I retrieve a harvested bird is check for a band. I encourage you to do the same. Band information should be reported to 1-800-327-BAND.        Logged  Cut em!

However, band recoveries are not randomly distributed either geographically or by species.  Mallards are far and away the most commonly banded duck.

Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page      It works!   This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at

                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full

                found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server.  The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:  /etc/apache2/

                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.   ports.conf is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.  Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.  They are activated by symlinking available

                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
                           started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
                           default configuration.     Document Roots   By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf .  The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.    Reporting Problems   Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the
                Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.  Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)

|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf

|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf    apache2.conf is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.   ports.conf is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.  Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.  They are activated by symlinking available
                           configuration files from their respective
                           *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
                           by using our helpers a2enmod,
                                a2dismod,  a2ensite,
                                a2dissite, and a2enconf,
                                a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information.  The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
                           started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
                           default configuration.     Document Roots   By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf .  The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.    Reporting Problems   Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the
                Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.  Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
                to respective packages, not to the web server itself.

What's this big deal?  Are these special birds?  From a particular location?  Some prize from Fish & Game for turning in a band? Thanks in advance for the replies.  I've only been hunting a few years and I'm just trying to understand....     _________________ Benelli - Cordoba (12 ga.) Browning - 725 Sporting (12 ga.)

It's also useful for providing information to biologists for tracking different species and their migration patterns and whatnot.  I'm no expert but this is just my personal estimation from reading about banding birds.  I sure someone else here probably knows a lot more about it.

Not much, but certainly more than we'd otherwise know.  Sometimes the bird was banded thousands of miles away from where it was taken.  Other times, it was banded within the municipality where it was taken. The mystique, I think, is the fact that for all the research and banding that takes place, a relatively small percentage of birds are actually banded, and an even smaller percentage are actually taken.  A man made rarity, so to speak.  Kind of like getting the brass ring on a carousel.

Sometimes they will have a reward band also, and that is cash in your pocket when you turn the band in. A guy that hunts by me shot a $100 goose last year.

I have hunted waterfowl for over 25 years and have killed one goose band and one duck band. On our place we kill about one band per thousand. Its a big deal to do it.

(The duck is now mounted on my wall) That's a ticket in Iowa. Guys got busted for that a couple years ago. They were standing on the refuge line and having their dogs retrieve the birds that fell into the refuge. I talked to the game warden about it afterwards (hes a good friend of mine) and he said since they sent the dogs in there to retrieve, it was the same as if they went in themselves to retrieve it. It doesnt make any sense, because its better than the bird going to waste.. but he also explained that maybe the bird was still alive and had a chance of surviving until the dog grabbed it. In that case I can see how it would be against the law, you are taking a bird out of a refuge that has a chance of living. But I guess they cant prove that it was still alive so even if the bird is stone dead its still a ticket.

I found it and there are seven bands.  Each one is a story. I have given two to hunters that also shot at the same bird and another to a kid on his first duck hunt.  I shot the banded drake, but four fell and so I said the banded bird fell on his side so it must have been his. One band I had to send in to Laurel MD.  It was hard to read and very thin.  They did not think I had the number right; it was an  8 your old band and it was put on a duck that was mature.  He was pretty thin and it was late in the season. Many years ago I jumped a bunch of ducks on the river and it was in the days when I did not have a dog.  I had three ducks down, a strong cripple drake, a belly up hen with band floating in the river and a nice drake on the sand bar.  I was able to retrieve the bird on the sandbar. I fell chasing the other drake and broke a metacarpal in my left hand and dislocated two fingers.  I could still the banded bird it had drifted to the other bank.  I had to drive 12 miles to cross a bridge and then walk over a mile to get that banded bird,  but I did what I had to do to get that banded bird.  It was cold enough that I just held my hand out of the window on my way to the emergency room. Sure glad I have had retrievers since that time. Back in the days of the point system.  We passed on a mixed group of divers as there were redheads in the mix. They  landed and then swam in to us. Three redheads got up and ran at us and I could and could see the drake in the middle was  banded.  I said the middle one has a band and I shot.  My partner that day could not believe that I could see the band. Banded birds are useful in studying migration patterns and harvest information.  They help us remember hunts of long ago.  _________________ Spencer "A peculiar virtue in wildlife ethics is that the hunter ordinarily has no gallery to applaud or disapprove of his conduct.

But I guess they cant prove that it was still alive so even if the bird is stone dead its still a ticket. Well this is not an official refuge. It is a place that used to be a refuge or something and is now just private I believe. I really don't care anyway what the Gamey would have said or done.  The Duck was stone dead and I was going to retrieve a dad bird.  Give me the ticket and I will beat it in court any day.  There are conflicting laws in that case.  it is a law you have to make at least an attempt to recover any downed game wounded or otherwise and that is clearly printed in the literature.  Is the so called made up by the gamey as we go law you cite published in the literature? Plus in my eyes big difference between intentionally doing it and having the bird drop there unintentionally. SO thanks for trying to rain on my parade but I'll still take pride in my 13 year old dog making one hell of a retrieve and it coming back with a band. But nice try.  _________________  "I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more , is none" Bill S.

It was banded in Long Lake Waterfowl Production Area in Sheridan County Montana which is in the NE corner almost in Canada and ND. It was also banded as an adult so was hatched no earlier than 2007. That's at least a thousand miles Amazing to me.  _________________  "I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more , is none" Bill S.

So, I'd say it is all just luck.  That being said, you have a better chance of a band if you hunt where mottled's are or if you shoot redhead hens.  Just don't make your hunts all about bands, you will miss out on a ton of things better            milkfisher   Members Profile  Send Private Message  Find Members Posts  Add to Buddy List   Duckaholic   Senior Antagonizerist Joined: 24 April 2004 Location: United States Status: Offline Points: 6577    Post Options   Post Reply  Quote milkfisher  Report Post   Thanks(0)      Quote  Reply   Posted: 12 January 2012 at 10:48am      Ive got 1 canada, 1 speck, 1 mallard, 1 pintail, and one redhead.  5 total.   BU ive killed like eleventy thousand ducks/geese so its not such a big deal......I mean, Im a big deal, but me having 5 bands isnt a big deal.

Going through a few years of records at a club I hunt with Arkansas the numbers vary greatly year to year.  Some years they will kill a band on average every 300 birds or so, others every 150.  This is out of nearly all mallards.  Some lucky folks average about every 100 or less.            spoonbill   Members Profile  Send Private Message  Find Members Posts  Add to Buddy List   Member   Joined: 24 June 2010 Location: Spring, Tx.

Average 87,000 banded birds harvested a year Progam wide.    As of January 2011 and since 1960*, the BBL has received over 64 million banding records. Since the inception of the North American Bird Banding Program, the BBL has received over 4 million encounter records . On average, over the past decade, the BBL received 1.2 million banding and 87,000 encounter records per year. ( http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/homepage/howmany.cfm )    Fun Fact:  The oldest known waterfowl banded in North America was a Canada goose that lived to be 30 years and 4 months old. The oldest mallard lived to 26 years, 4 months.

In high school I used to hunt near an area where they banded mottleds, but never got one myself. My friends seemed to get like 1 a week for the first month of the season (mottled bands). In the past two season I have killed over 200 birds, but only 2 bands(both wood ducks). One was the only bird killed on the hunt, and the other was one of two birds killed. Don't worry one day luck will cross your path. The feeling of looking down at you first band is like nothing else, and even after 12 the feeling is still the same.    And as oneshot said kill as many redhead hens as you can....seems they band more hens than drakes.

Your shows possession, you're is you are. So it's you're a total douche. Just thought I'd throw that if YOU'RE going to name call. Anyways, yes, it is luck. I happen to live close to mottled territory and have killed 2 banded mottled ducks, that were banded in the same area, and I have a couple others from Alberta and South Dakota. It's strictly luck, but if you put the time and effort in you'll get some. Can't get any if you don't shoot birds. Shooting birds = scouting, preparing, and making the best of your hunts.

Milk, you know you were suggesting I was lying and yeah that pissed me off so I felt there was nothing wrong with saying something disrespectful right back at you... Yall said you need to earn respect..? I think if I didn't do anything to lose respect it's the same thing..?

And the language had best stop.  You're lucky playaxplorer was doing the editing instead of me.  The grown men on this site aren't allowed to use that language, and the kids for darn sure aren't going to be allowed to.    All that said, participate and enjoy the site.  You'll learn a lot and meet some great folks here for sure.         "It's clear I've set the bar for reading comprehension way too high in your case.

Apparently I "Shouldn't be talking to a grown man like that" What the hell is your definition of a grown man? An 18 year old? Or someone like me who has a job, works for his money, buys his own stuff, and self dependent? Respecting elders is over rated, our elders are the people who raised up this crappy generation people who listen to nickel music, smoke weed, get drunk every night and start having sex when they're 10. Its a shame. I say you respect people who respect you, age is just a number.  The older you get, the more you will understand how untrue everything you just said is. You will be amazed at how much you can learn from the guys on here if you would take a step back and listen, not just about duck hunting, but about life in general. No matter how smart you may be, you don't have anywhere near the amount of life experience that someone 20, 30 or 50 years older than you does, and there are a lot of things you can't learn through anything but experience.

This effort includes banding programs from the coast of Louisiana to the plains of the Dakotas to the Arctic breeding grounds of geese and eiders. Every summer, Ducks Unlimited operates waterfowl banding crews at stations in the Prairie Pothole Region of North and South Dakota.      Where Do Your Ducks Come From?

In simple terms, recovery of leg bands helps us to estimate survival probability of banded waterfowl by indicating how many birds died. Not all leg-banded birds that are killed are recovered and reported to the Bird Banding Laboratory because some birds are not retrieved, or if retrieved, are not reported.  This loss of information reduces precision or confidence in an estimate. We can improve precision by increasing both recovery and reporting rates.  Hunting with a well-trained retriever will help reduce crippling loss and therefore improve recovery rates. Calling your band number in to the Bird Banding Laboratory  (800-327-BAND) or reporting your band online will improve reporting rates.

Im 20 years old and have never killed a banded duck, which I hear is not so odd, but whatever.  I've never been on a hunt when a banded duck was taken either.  I would really love to kill a banded duck in my lifetime.  I've heard stories of people killing them or being present when they were killed.  I've seen guys with 2-3 lanyards full of bands and I've seen guys whose lanyard has 1 or 2 bands on it.  Seen both extremes.  I have never really looked into the percentage of ducks they band each year.  Does anyone know the statistics on how many ducks they band a year?? Just curious. Also, just out of curiousity, did anyone kill a banded duck during the first split of duck season?? Post pics if you have them, if not oh well.  And one final thing, lets see how many banded ducks you guys have killed throughout your duck hunting career just out of curiousity, once again, pictures are always good.  Have a great day guys.

We average on a good year 650 ducks and slow year 350 ducks. I've hunted for 23 years so probably been on around 9000 ducks killed and only 7 bands.  There are some places that year in year out kill banded ducks. The last two I killed I saw it on there leg when they were coming in to sit.         mallard17 ,  Nov 28, 2012      mallard17 ,  Nov 28, 2012             Nov 28, 2012    #8             DHunt85  Well-Known Member        1,055     4      Maumelle          I have killed two bands in my 20 years of hunting. 1 Canadian Goose banded in Daradnelle and a Green Winged Teal hen, banded in Saskatchewan.

I know guys that have hunted about as much as me that have killed several.  Maybe they should go buy some powerball tickets.  Ill save my money!

I've killed 9 in 29 years......2 of them reward double bands. One for 10$ and one for 100$.......both expired. The one I like the most is this one. Never had seen one before I killed it and at first I thought it was some private operation band or something til I saw the advise bird band written on it &researched it. They put these on the duck when it's on the nest before they can fly or even tell what the sex of the duck is.

I've seen 2 killed while I was hunting. my dad always tells a story of a place called he and his buddies called band point. I dont know the exact number of bands killed but the majority of the ones they killed were from that area. I guess some of it is luck and some of it is statistical. if you hun the middle of the flyway then you will see more killed.

Its was unusual. IT was banded in Cananda by a group called the Jack Miner Foundation. It is a sancuary or something up there. I filled out a online form and emailed it back. I hope I hear something from them.         duck ,  Nov 28, 2012      duck ,  Nov 28, 2012             Nov 28, 2012    #14             Hambone  Well-Known Member        1,544     8      Central Arkansas             duck said: ↑   Killed one first day this year.

That is something very special and rare.  What bible verse did it have on it??

Another guy got the band. I've only ever killed one. I've seen 5 or 6 killed. My uncle has been hunting his whole life and never killed one and he is 60. I've seen two ducks flying with bands and neither one of them were killed. One was a youth hunt and the other was last year on the last day of season after we had already killed our limit and all our guns were unloaded.

Seen 10-12 killed..... I usually get one every 3 year or so. Usually see one killed every year.....however last year I saw none and year before saw 3. Bands turn adults into kids...... I love and hate to see them killed         arkrem870 ,  Nov 28, 2012      arkrem870 ,  Nov 28, 2012             Nov 28, 2012    #20             SwampCat  Well-Known Member  Lifetime Supporter        18,665     5,573      South Arkansas          I have been duck hunting just over 50 years and have probably taken about ten bands - all mallards. I have seen two taken out of the same bunch twice. In the late 1970's, on the upper ouachita NWR in LA our group of 8 or 10 folks took six one morning. Don't remember how many ducks we killed altogether that day, but it was a bunch. I was working for USFWS at the time testing steel shot, and we were not bound by normal limits. I believe there are more killed in the MS flyway than the central or farther west. I did a rough calculation one time, hunting here in SW AR which draws a lot of it's birds from the central flyway - we average about one band for every 1000 or so ducks killed.
