Mortality     Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S. In 1987, it surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. 1  An estimated 158,080 Americans are expected to die from lung cancer in 2016, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths. 2  The number of deaths caused by lung cancer peaked at 159,292 in 2005 and has since decreased by 2.3 percent to 155,610 in 2014. 1  The age-adjusted death rate for lung cancer is higher for men (51.7 per 100,000 persons) than for women (34.7 per 100,000 persons). It is similar for blacks (45.7 per 100,000 persons) and whites (45.4 per 100,000 persons) overall. However, black men have a far higher age-adjusted lung cancer death rate than white men, while black and white women have similar rates. 1       Prevalence and Incidence     Approximately 415,000 Americans living today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point in their lives. 3  During 2016, an estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer were expected to be diagnosed, representing about 13 percent of all cancer diagnoses. 2  The majority of living lung cancer patients have been diagnosed within the last five years. Lung cancer is mostly a disease of the elderly. In 2013, 83 percent of those living with lung cancer were 60 years of age or older. 3  In 2013, Kentucky had the highest age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rates in both men (113.2 per 100,000) and women (78.3 per 100,000). Utah had the lowest age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in both men and women (30.0 per 100,000 and 22.9 per 100,000, respectively). 4 These state-specific rates were parallel to smoking prevalence rates.  Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2012. 5  The National Institutes of Health estimate that cancer care cost the U.S. an overall $147.5 billion in 2015, $13.4 billion of which is due to lung cancer. Lost productivity due to early death from cancer lead to an additional $134.8 billion in 2005, $36.1 billion of which was caused by lung cancer. 6       Gender Differences     More men are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, but more women live with the disease. The rate of new cases in 2013 showed that men develop lung cancer more often than women (60.7 and 47.7 per 100,000, respectively). 3  The rate of new lung cancer cases (incidence) over the past 39 years has dropped 32 percent for men while it has risen 94 percent for women . In 1975, rates were low for women, but rising for both men and women. In 1984, the rate of new cases for men peaked (102.1 per 100,000) and then began declining. The rate of new cases for women increased further, did not peak until 1998 (52.9 per 100,000), and has now started to decline. 3       Racial/Ethnic Differences     Black men and women are more likely to develop and die from lung cancer than persons of any other racial or ethnic group. The age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rate among black men is approximately 28 percent higher than for white men, even though their overall exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor for lung cancer, is lower. 3, 7  The lung cancer incidence rate for black women is roughly equal to that of white women, despite the fact that they smoke fewer cigarettes. 3, 7       Survival Rates     What Does Survival Rate Mean?  Doctors use lung cancer survival rates or survival statistics to tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type and stage of cancer for a specific amount of time. It is based on population averages and is not a predictor of how long any one individual diagnosed with cancer will live. Learn more .    The lung cancer five-year survival rate (17.7 percent) is lower than many other leading cancer sites, such as the colon (64.4 percent), breast (89.7 percent) and prostate (98.9 percent). 3  The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 55 percent for cases detected when the disease is still localized (within the lungs). However, only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage. For distant tumors (spread to other organs) the five-year survival rate is only 4 percent. 3  More than half of people with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. 3        Screening and Early Detection     Screening for individuals at high risk has the potential to dramatically improve lung cancer survival rates by finding the disease at an earlier, more treatable stage.  A 2011 study found that screening high risk individuals with low-dose CT scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent compared to chest X-ray. 8  At least 8.6 million Americans qualify as high risk for lung cancer and are recommended to receive annual screening with low-dose CT scans. 9  If half of these high risk individuals were screened, over 13,000 lung cancer deaths could be prevented. 8,9       Smoking-Attributable Lung Cancer     Smoking , a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women are 13 times more likely, compared to never smokers. 10  Between 2005 and 2010, an average of 130,659 Americans (74,300 men and 56,359 women) died of smoking-attributable lung cancer each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 7,330 lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers every year. 11  Nonsmokers have a 20 to 30 percent greater chance of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work. 12       Other Causes     It has been estimated that active smoking is responsible for close to 90 percent of lung cancer cases; radon causes 10 percent, occupational exposures to carcinogens account for approximately 9 to 15 percent and outdoor air pollution 1 to 2 percent. Because of the interactions between exposures, the combined attributable risk for lung cancer can exceed 100 percent. 13  Exposure to radon is estimated to be the second-leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year (range of 8,000 to 45,000). Radon is a tasteless, colorless and odorless gas that is produced by decaying uranium and occurs naturally in soil and rock. The majority of these deaths occur among smokers since there is a greater risk for lung cancer when smokers also are exposed to radon. 14  Lung cancer can also be caused by occupational exposures, including asbestos , uranium and coke (an important fuel in the manufacture of iron in smelters, blast furnaces and foundries). The combination of asbestos exposure and smoking greatly increases the risk of developing lung cancer. 15  Nonsmoking asbes­tos workers are five times more likely to develop lung cancer than non­smokers not ex­posed to asbestos; if they also smoke, the risk factor jumps to 50 or higher. 13 Environmental exposures also can increase the risk of lung cancer death. 16     For more information, please review the Lung Cancer Morbidity and Mortality Trend Report call the Lung HelpLine at1-800-LUNGUSA (1-800-586-4872).

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80% to 85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.  Statistics for lung cancer include both small cell and NSCLC. This year, an estimated 222,500 adults (116,990 men and 105,510 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer. Black men are about 20% more likely to get lung cancer than white men. Black women are 10% less likely to get cancer when compared with white women.  Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death for men and women. It is estimated that 155,870 (84,590 men and 71,280 women) deaths from this disease will occur this year.  Lung cancer makes up 14% of all new cancer diagnoses and accounts for 1 in 4 cancer deaths. Due to a decrease in smoking, death rates have declined by 43% since 1990 in men and 17% in women since 2002.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for all people with lung cancer is 18%. The 5-year survival rate for men is 15%. The 5-year survival rate for women is 21%.  However, survival rates depend on several factors, including the subtype of lung cancer, and the stage of disease.  For people with stage IA and IB NSCLC, the 5-year survival rate is about 49% and 45% respectively. It is 30% for stage IIA cancer, and 31% for stage IIB cancer. For stage IIIA NSCLC, the 5-year survival rate is about 14%, and about 5% for stage IIIB. When NSCLC has spread outside of the lungs, it can be difficult to treat. The 5-year survival rate for stage IV NSCLC is around 1%.  Each year, tens of thousands of people are cured of NSCLC in the United States. And, some patients with advanced lung cancer can live many years after diagnosis. Sometimes patients who are told that their lung cancer is incurable live longer than many who are told that their lung cancer is curable. The important thing to remember is that lung cancer is treatable at any stage, and these treatments have been proven to help people with lung cancer live longer with better quality of life.  Furthermore, it is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with NSCLC are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. It is not an estimate of how long a person is likely to live with cancer. People should talk with their doctor if they have questions about this information. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatments that have become widely available in the past 5 years. Learn more about understanding statistics .

Incidence Rates by Race/Ethnicity and Sex  “Incidence rate” means how many people out of a given number get the disease each year. The graph below shows how many people out of 100,000 got lung cancer each year during the years 1999–2014. The year 2014 is the most recent year for which numbers have been reported. The lung cancer incidence rate is grouped by race and ethnicity.  The graph below shows that in 2014, among men, black men had the highest rate of getting lung cancer, followed by white, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI), and Hispanic men. Among women, white women had the highest rate of getting lung cancer, followed by black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic women.

More in Lung Cancer        Causes & Risk Factors       Non-Small Cell     Small Cell     Symptoms     Diagnosis     Treatment     Living With     Support & Coping        We know that smoking causes lung cancer, but it’s also clear that some people smoke their whole lives and never develop lung cancer. So, what percentage of smokers actually get lung cancer? How much does that risk decrease if you quit? Smoking and Lung Cancer Most statistics look at the overall risk of lung cancer , combining both people who smoke and those who have never smoked. Based on United States statistics, the lifetime risk that a person will develop lung cancer is 6.4 percent or a little greater than one out of every 15 people.         Clearly, this number would be higher for those who have smoked and lower for those who haven't. We have very few studies which have broken these numbers down between never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers, but an older 2006 European study did make these distinctions. In that study, the risk of developing lung cancer was: 0.2 percent for men who never smoked; 0.4 percent for women 5.5 percent of male former smokers; 2.6 percent in women 15.9 percent of current male smokers; 9.5 percent for women 24.4 percent for male “heavy smokers” defined as smoking more than five cigarettes per day; 18.5 percent for women An earlier Canadian study quoted the lifetime risk for male smokers at 17.2 percent and 11.6 percent in women versus only 1.3 percent in male non-smokers and 1.4 percent in female non-smokers . Leading Cause of Cancer-Related Deaths To properly address why this question is so important, it's important to point out that smoking is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and women in the United States.   One out of four cancer deaths is due to lung cancer and lung cancer kills more people than breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer combined. Of these cancers, it's thought that at least 80 percent can be attributed to smoking. There are many chemicals in cigarettes that are known to cause cancer and more which are considered toxic to humans.         It's not only lung cancer, however. There are many cancers which are caused by smoking . And it's not just smoking that's a problem, it's thought that roughly 7300 people die from lung cancer each year caused by second-hand smoke. Lung Cancer Risk in People Who Smoke It appears that the earlier in life you begin smoking, the higher your risk of developing lung cancer. Your risk also depends on the number of “ pack-years ” you have smoked. A pack-year is a number that is calculated by multiplying the number of years smoked times the number of packs of cigarettes smoked daily. Quitting smoking lowers the risk of lung cancer, but it can take some time before your risk decreases. If you have smoked for more than a short period of time, your risk will never reach that of a never smoker. But, it is still very worth the effort to quit. Researchers looking at people in Asia and Australia found that people could reduce their risk of developing lung cancer by up to 70 percent by quitting smoking. In one estimate, a 68-year-old man who had smoked two packs per day for 50 years (100 pack-years) had a 15 percent risk of developing lung cancer in the next 10 years if he continued to smoke. This risk would drop to 10.8 percent if he quit smoking.         You may also be wondering how cutting down but not quitting impacts risk. In one study, it was found that people who smoked more than 15 cigarettes per day could significantly lower their risk if they cut the number of cigarettes they smoked daily in half. Another study was less positive about the cutting down approach and suggested that quitting altogether was necessary to bring about a significant difference in risk. Lung Cancer in Former Smokers As noted above, the risk of lung cancer rarely returns to normal when a person quits smoking. In fact, roughly 80 percent of people who develop lung cancer today are non-smokers; they either never smoked or more commonly quit smoking in the past (are former smokers.)  Predicting Risk While it is impossible to truly predict who will develop lung cancer, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has developed a Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool in which you can calculate your average risk of developing lung cancer in the next 10 years based on your age and how long you had or have smoked. The tool is designed for people between the ages of 50 and 75 who smoked between 10 and 60 cigarettes daily for a period of 25 and 55 years. It is preceded by a disclaimer that reminds individuals that the tool is only a prediction based on statistics and does not mean someone will or will not develop lung cancer. Screening Until recently, there had not been an effective screening test for lung cancer. People needed to rely on an awareness of the early symptoms of lung cancer in hope of finding the disease in the early and most treatable stages of the disease. Since nearly half of people are diagnosed when their lung cancer is already in the advanced stages, a knowledge of symptoms alone isn't enough. Thankfully—for some people at least— CT lung cancer screening has been approved and, when used according to guidelines, may decrease the mortality from lung cancer by 20 percent in the United States. People eligible for screening include those who: Are between the ages of 55 and 80 Have a 30 pack-year history of smoking Continue to smoke or quit smoking in the past 15 years Are in reasonable physical condition such that surgery could be done if a mass is found There are other people who may wish to be screened as well. For example, those who have been exposed to cancer-causing substances in the work place. If you feel you may be at risk, talk to your doctor. Even if you smoked, it's not too late to do other things to lower your risk of developing lung cancer . A Word From Verywell If you smoke or have smoked you might be feeling discouraged. It might help to look at these statistics from a different angle. Instead of fretting that your risk of lung cancer doesn't disappear, you might instead focus on the fact that 10 years after quitting your risk is only half of what it is today. It is never too late to quit. Even for those who have cancer, quitting can make a difference. You might be interested in checking out these reasons to quit smoking after a diagnosis of cancer . In addition to giving up the habit, there are other ways you can reduce your chances of dying from cancer. Eating healthy, having an active lifestyle, and getting screened if you qualify can all help.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer             Key Statistics for Lung Cancer       Most lung cancer statistics include both small cell and non-small cell lung cancers.  How common is lung cancer?  Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer ). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers.  The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:   About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)  About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)   Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon , breast, and prostate cancers combined.  Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people. Mostpeople diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older, while a very small number of people diagnosed younger than 45. The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 70.  Lifetime chance of getting lung cancer  Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 15; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 17. These numbers include both smokers and non-smokers. For smokers the risk is much higher, while for non-smokers the risk is lower.  Black men are about 20% more likely to develop lung cancer than white men. The rate is about 10% lower in black women than in white women. Both black and white women have lower rates than men, but the gap is closing. The lung cancer rate has been dropping among men over the past few decades, but only for about the last decade in women.  Statistics on survival in people with lung cancer vary depending on the stage (extent) of the cancer when it is diagnosed. For survival statistics based on the stage of the cancer, see Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Survival Rates By Stage .  Despite the very serious prognosis (outlook) of lung cancer, some people with earlier stage cancers are cured. More than 430,000 people alive today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point.  Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

To understand how lung cancer starts, different types, how it affects your body and other lung cancer basics, visit our Learn About Lung Cancer section .    Mortality     Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S. In 1987, it surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. 1  An estimated 158,080 Americans are expected to die from lung cancer in 2016, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths. 2  The number of deaths caused by lung cancer peaked at 159,292 in 2005 and has since decreased by 2.3 percent to 155,610 in 2014. 1  The age-adjusted death rate for lung cancer is higher for men (51.7 per 100,000 persons) than for women (34.7 per 100,000 persons). It is similar for blacks (45.7 per 100,000 persons) and whites (45.4 per 100,000 persons) overall. However, black men have a far higher age-adjusted lung cancer death rate than white men, while black and white women have similar rates. 1       Prevalence and Incidence     Approximately 415,000 Americans living today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point in their lives. 3  During 2016, an estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer were expected to be diagnosed, representing about 13 percent of all cancer diagnoses. 2  The majority of living lung cancer patients have been diagnosed within the last five years. Lung cancer is mostly a disease of the elderly. In 2013, 83 percent of those living with lung cancer were 60 years of age or older. 3  In 2013, Kentucky had the highest age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rates in both men (113.2 per 100,000) and women (78.3 per 100,000). Utah had the lowest age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in both men and women (30.0 per 100,000 and 22.9 per 100,000, respectively). 4 These state-specific rates were parallel to smoking prevalence rates.  Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2012. 5  The National Institutes of Health estimate that cancer care cost the U.S. an overall $147.5 billion in 2015, $13.4 billion of which is due to lung cancer. Lost productivity due to early death from cancer lead to an additional $134.8 billion in 2005, $36.1 billion of which was caused by lung cancer. 6       Gender Differences     More men are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, but more women live with the disease. The rate of new cases in 2013 showed that men develop lung cancer more often than women (60.7 and 47.7 per 100,000, respectively). 3  The rate of new lung cancer cases (incidence) over the past 39 years has dropped 32 percent for men while it has risen 94 percent for women . In 1975, rates were low for women, but rising for both men and women. In 1984, the rate of new cases for men peaked (102.1 per 100,000) and then began declining. The rate of new cases for women increased further, did not peak until 1998 (52.9 per 100,000), and has now started to decline. 3       Racial/Ethnic Differences     Black men and women are more likely to develop and die from lung cancer than persons of any other racial or ethnic group. The age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rate among black men is approximately 28 percent higher than for white men, even though their overall exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor for lung cancer, is lower. 3, 7  The lung cancer incidence rate for black women is roughly equal to that of white women, despite the fact that they smoke fewer cigarettes. 3, 7       Survival Rates     What Does Survival Rate Mean?  Doctors use lung cancer survival rates or survival statistics to tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type and stage of cancer for a specific amount of time. It is based on population averages and is not a predictor of how long any one individual diagnosed with cancer will live. Learn more .    The lung cancer five-year survival rate (17.7 percent) is lower than many other leading cancer sites, such as the colon (64.4 percent), breast (89.7 percent) and prostate (98.9 percent). 3  The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 55 percent for cases detected when the disease is still localized (within the lungs). However, only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage. For distant tumors (spread to other organs) the five-year survival rate is only 4 percent. 3  More than half of people with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. 3        Screening and Early Detection     Screening for individuals at high risk has the potential to dramatically improve lung cancer survival rates by finding the disease at an earlier, more treatable stage.  A 2011 study found that screening high risk individuals with low-dose CT scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent compared to chest X-ray. 8  At least 8.6 million Americans qualify as high risk for lung cancer and are recommended to receive annual screening with low-dose CT scans. 9  If half of these high risk individuals were screened, over 13,000 lung cancer deaths could be prevented. 8,9       Smoking-Attributable Lung Cancer     Smoking , a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women are 13 times more likely, compared to never smokers. 10  Between 2005 and 2010, an average of 130,659 Americans (74,300 men and 56,359 women) died of smoking-attributable lung cancer each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 7,330 lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers every year. 11  Nonsmokers have a 20 to 30 percent greater chance of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work. 12       Other Causes     It has been estimated that active smoking is responsible for close to 90 percent of lung cancer cases; radon causes 10 percent, occupational exposures to carcinogens account for approximately 9 to 15 percent and outdoor air pollution 1 to 2 percent. Because of the interactions between exposures, the combined attributable risk for lung cancer can exceed 100 percent. 13  Exposure to radon is estimated to be the second-leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year (range of 8,000 to 45,000). Radon is a tasteless, colorless and odorless gas that is produced by decaying uranium and occurs naturally in soil and rock. The majority of these deaths occur among smokers since there is a greater risk for lung cancer when smokers also are exposed to radon. 14  Lung cancer can also be caused by occupational exposures, including asbestos , uranium and coke (an important fuel in the manufacture of iron in smelters, blast furnaces and foundries). The combination of asbestos exposure and smoking greatly increases the risk of developing lung cancer. 15  Nonsmoking asbes­tos workers are five times more likely to develop lung cancer than non­smokers not ex­posed to asbestos; if they also smoke, the risk factor jumps to 50 or higher. 13 Environmental exposures also can increase the risk of lung cancer death. 16     For more information, please review the Lung Cancer Morbidity and Mortality Trend Report call the Lung HelpLine at1-800-LUNGUSA (1-800-586-4872).

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

Author information 1 Bureau of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Tunney's Pasture, Ottawa, Ontario. Abstract Life table methodology was used to estimate the probability of developing lung cancer by smoking status. Lifetime risks of developing lung cancer were estimated for six hypothetical cohorts (males, females, male current smokers, male never smokers, female current smokers, and female never smokers). Estimates of smoking mortality and incidence rates were calculated based on Canadian rates observed over the period 1987 to 1989. It was found that 172/1,000 of male current smokers will eventually develop lung cancer; the similar probability among female current smokers was 116/1,000. For those who never smoked on a regular basis the lifetime risk was substantially reduced. Only 13/1,000 males and 14/1,000 females in this category will develop lung cancer. When smoking status is not adjusted for, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is approximately 96/1,000 and 43/1,000 for males and females respectively.

Smoking  Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States, cigarette smoking is linked to about 80% to 90% of lung cancers. Using other tobacco products such as cigars or pipes also increases the risk for lung cancer. Tobacco smoke is a toxic mix of more than 7,000 chemicals. Many are poisons. At least 70 are known to cause cancer in people or animals.  People who smoke cigarettes are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke. Even smoking a few cigarettes a day or smoking occasionally increases the risk of lung cancer. The more years a person smokes and the more cigarettes smoked each day, the more risk goes up.  People who quit smoking have a lower risk of lung cancer than if they had continued to smoke, but their risk is higher than the risk for people who never smoked. Quitting smoking at any age can lower the risk of lung cancer.  Cigarette smoking can cause cancer almost anywhere in the body. Cigarette smoking causes cancer of the mouth and throat, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, voicebox (larynx), trachea, bronchus, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, and cervix, and causes acute myeloid leukemia.   Secondhand Smoke  Smoke from other people’s cigarettes, pipes, or cigars ( secondhand smoke ) also causes lung cancer. When a person breathes in secondhand smoke, it is like he or she is smoking. In the United States, two out of five adults who don’t smoke and half of children are exposed to secondhand smoke, and about 7,300 people who never smoked die from lung cancer due to secondhand smoke every year.   Radon  Radon is a naturally occurring gas that comes from rocks and dirt and can get trapped in houses and buildings. It cannot be seen, tasted, or smelled. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon causes about 20,000 cases of lung cancer each year, making it the second leading cause of lung cancer. Nearly one out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is thought to have high radon levels. The EPA recommends testing homes for radon and using proven ways to lower high radon levels.  Other Substances  Examples of substances found at some workplaces that increase risk include asbestos,  arsenic,  diesel exhaust, and some forms of silica and chromium. For many of these substances, the risk of getting lung cancer is even higher for those who smoke.   Personal or Family History of Lung Cancer  If you are a lung cancer survivor, there is a risk that you may develop another lung cancer, especially if you smoke. Your risk of lung cancer may be higher if your parents, brothers or sisters, or children have had lung cancer. This could be true because they also smoke, or they live or work in the same place where they are exposed to radon and other substances that can cause lung cancer.   Radiation Therapy to the Chest  Cancer survivors who had radiation therapy to the chest are at higher risk of lung cancer.   Diet  Scientists are studying many different foods and dietary supplements to see whether they change the risk of getting lung cancer. There is much we still need to know. We do know that smokers who take beta-carotene supplements have increased risk of lung cancer. For more information, visit Lung Cancer Prevention.  Also, arsenic in drinking water (primarily from private wells) can increase the risk of lung cancer. For more information, visit the EPA’s Arsenic in Drinking Water.       What Is Lung Cancer?

Our experts developed a screening decision tool to help you better understand your risk.  Learn more     Smoking, the number one cause of preventable death in the United States, causes 130,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Many smokers are now considering screening with low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) scans in the hope of diagnosing the disease early. A new study that shows lung cancer risk varies widely among smokers may help individuals and their doctors decide if voluntary screening is appropriate for them.  Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center analyzed data from a large lung cancer prevention study and found that the risk of developing lung cancer can be accurately predicted based on a person’s age, sex, and smoking history. These factors accounted for an individual’s 10-year risk for developing lung cancer which ranged from a low of less than 1% to a high of 16%. The study, along with an interactive lung cancer risk prediction tool, is published in the March 19 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute .  “The risk assessment tool should help physicians and patients balance the possible risks and benefits of screening,” explained Peter Bach , M.D. of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering and the study’s first author. “For example, the subjects in our study who were at the low end of risk had less than a 1% chance of getting lung cancer in the next ten years. That needs to be contrasted with the 30 to 50 percent risk that a screening CT will show some lung scar or shadow that requires further evaluation or surgical biopsy, even though it will ultimately be deemed to be harmless.  “The researchers reviewed the information from a lung cancer prevention study called the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) conducted by investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. This randomized, multi-center trial looked at the effect of beta-carotene and Vitamin A supplements on lung cancer prevention in 18,314 people. The subjects included 14,254 men and women aged 50 to 69 who were considered heavy smokers - defined as having smoked at least one pack per day for 20 years and who were either current smokers or had stopped smoking within 6 years prior to enrolling in the study. The remaining 4060 participants were asbestos exposed men aged 45 to 69 who were either current smokers or former smokers who quit within 15 years of enrollment. The trial was terminated in 1996 after preliminary results indicated no benefit and possible harm from the supplements among individuals who continued to smoke cigarettes.  For the new study, the data from 18,172 subjects in the CARET trial who had a history of current or former smoking were used to create a mathematical model that predicts the likelihood that an individual will be diagnosed with lung cancer within the next ten years.For the risk prediction model, the duration of smoking, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, duration of abstinence, and age turned out to be the main factors that determined the probability of an individual being diagnosed with lung cancer. Looking at examples from people undergoing lung cancer screening, a 51-year-old woman who smoked one pack per day for 29 years but stopped smoking 9 years earlier had a 0.8% (less than 1 in a 100) risk of getting lung cancer in the next ten years while a 68-year-old man who smoked two packs a day for the past 50 years and continued to smoke had a 15% (1 out of 7) chance of developing the disease in the same time period.  “Our findings suggest that accurate risk prediction may also be useful for researchers designing clinical trials of early lung cancer diagnosis,” said Colin Begg , Ph.D., chairman of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering and senior author of the study. “For example, focusing on the truly high-risk individuals may allow for more effective clinical trials of lung cancer screening and prevention.”  Mark G. Kris , M.D., chief of Thoracic Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering and one of the study’s co-authors, believes the new model will be a valuable tool in assessing risk. “Using the new model, we have a much better way to predict who is at high risk for developing lung cancer and, equally important, who is at a lower risk. With more than 90 million current and former smokers in the U.S., we need an accurate way to identify those individuals at exceptionally high risk who have the most to gain from screening.”  The study’s co-authors include Michael W. Kattan, Ph.D., Ramsey C. Tate and Lillian J. Hsieh of Memorial Sloan Kettering; Mark D. Thornquist, Ph.D. and Matt J. Barnett, M.S. of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The study was funded by the “Steps for Breath Fund” from The Society of Memorial Sloan Kettering and by a Public Health Service grant from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Smokers  Lung Cancer  Oncology  Health Effects of Smoking  Smoking  Cancer  Medicine and Healthcare Is it true that only 5 percent of smokers get lung cancer? Update Cancel Answer Wiki No. yes 22 Answers Quora User , Everyone has cancer cells... Updated Aug 13, 2015 · Author has 1.5k answers and 4.9m answer views I'm going to use the USA for my answer, but it applies everywhere NO, this is not true. The number is actually less. Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer  death in the United States for both men and women. 2012 estimated new cases of lung cancer: 226,160 2012 estimated deaths from lung cancer: 160,340 Besides lung cancer, tobacco use also causes increased risk for cancers of the mouth, lips, nose and sinuses, voice box, throat, esophagus, and others. Cigars contain many of the same carcinogens that are found in cigarettes. Tobacco use is responsible for nearly 1 in 5 deaths. (For all reasons, not just lung cancer.)  Tobacco use accounts for at least 30% of all cancer deaths and 87% of lung cancer deaths. Each year, about 3,400 non-smoking adults die of lung cancer as a result of breathing secondhand smoke. The CDC (US Agency) reports that 19.3% of American adults over the age of 18 roughly 45 million people -- were smokers in 2010, down from 20.9% in 2005. So how is it less? So if ~45,000,000+ people in the US smoke and ~160,000+ people die each year , the percentage on a yearly basis of getting lung cancer is less than one percent. (.0035%) Although you have less than one percent risk of death each year , statistically speaking you are playing the odds each extra year that you smoke.  The older you get, and the longer you smoke the weaker your lungs become and the higher your risk that you will be in the percentage that gets lung cancer in any given year. Over a sixty year period, almost 10 million people will die of lung cancer. But isn't 10,000,000 close to 22% of 45,000,000 smokers? Yes, but the ten million is over 60 years, and in that time, many of the 45 million smokers have quit and new ones have started.  So the TOTAL amount of smokers in a 60 year period is much higher than 45 million. However, if you smoke for 60+ years, your chances at the end of that 60 year period will increase and continue to increase with each extra year that you smoke. The percentage of lung cancers mortality by age group: Age 20 to 34 – 0.1% Age 35 to 44 – 1.3% Age 45 to 54 – 7.9% Age 55 to 64 – 19.6% Age 65 to 74 – 30.5% Age 75 to 84 – 30.6% Age 85+         – 10% Obviously people aged 85 and older have a lower percentage because many of the smokers under that age have already died.  All diagnosed lung cancers do not lead to death from lung cancer, many cancers metastasize to other areas of the body (i.e. bone cancer, brain cancer). According to the National Cancer Institute (US Agency); 1 in 14 smokers will be diagnosed with cancer of the lung and bronchus during their lifetime.  The median age at death for cancer of the lung and bronchus is 72 years of age. ***** Read on for personal anecdotes... My step-father was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 62.  Young according to the chart above.  However he had excessive risk factors.  He had been smoking since the age of 13 (49 years), he smoked the cigarettes with the highest tar and nicotine rating, he smoked cigarettes that had no filter, and he worked in a metal foundry. I knew he would not live longer than 5 years when they removed one lung and were unable to remove all of the cancer that was wrapped around a rib bone.  Even after several bouts of radiation and chemotherapy, the cancer metastasized to the brain which apparently is quite common. He went ahead with brain surgery and further radiation and died 6 months later at the age of 65 with the COD listed as metastatic brain cancer from primary lung cancer. My biological father had smoked 5 packs of menthol cigarettes a day for decades, but watching my step-father slowly decay and the misery he went through with the treatments and vomiting was enough to instigate him to quit.  He has emphysema pretty bad, and has to use inhalers to stop the wheezing.  He has recently begun to complain of a chronic sore throat and a feeling of not being able to breathe although his O2 stats are normal. My mother was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer.  (Cancer located in both sides of the lungs.)  She was 84.  She smoked for 60 years (age 12 to age 72).  She assumed when she reached 82 that because she was cancer free for ten years after quitting that she had missed the bullet.  She was wrong.  She did not have surgery, chemo, radiation, or pain meds.  The last two years of her life were actually pretty normal considering.  It would have been much worse for her physically had she tried to 'fight' the cancer, just to have extra time on earth...  She was very lucky that the cancer did not metastasize to the bone next to the tumor. 16.4k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Undo Related Questions More Answers Below Is it true that most people under 35 years old who die from lung cancer are not smokers? What percent of smokers get lung cancer? Is it possible to bring a smoker's lungs back to healthy ones? How did non-smoker Lesley Gore get lung cancer? Why it is that only some smokers get lung cancer and others who smoke don't? Ask New Question   Dane Gruenebaum , Practicing Physician Answered Feb 13, 2015 · Author has 152 answers and 183.8k answer views The exact number is not important, and in fact lets assume an even more conservative number say 1% (again not accurate and not important). The reason why is the number does not do it justice. Lung cancer is not the only or even primary killer of smokers, consider: heart disease, bronchitis, emphysema, stroke, among others and non lung cancers associated with smoking: laryngeal (voice box),  oral, sinus, tracheal (throat), esophageal (food pipe to stomach), stomach, pancreas, cervix, kidney, bladder, ovary, colorectal, and perhaps some leukemias such as AML. The point is many smokers suffer and ultimately die from other diseases before they develop lung cancer, or these diseases kill them before the lung cancer does. The seemingly low percentage is falsely reassuring for something that is so harmful to our bodies that it is hard to see the collective illness it has brought upon us. Bottom line, avoid tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookah, chew, snuff etc. ( I would also include e-cigarettes as there is still much we don't know about them) Though smoking seems to be worse than chew/snuff for lung cancer. To give a number: It is a difficult question to answer, how do we define smokers? People who have ever smoked? People who smoked 10 pack years? How does that work out for pipe smokers, cigar smokers, or hookah? Per the American Cancer Society Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 13; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 16. These numbers include both smokers and non-smokers. For smokers the risk is much higher, while for non-smokers the risk is lower. Per the US Dept of Health and Human Service report Smoking, a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women are 13 times more likely, compared to never smokers. 8 Per the CDC the prevalence of smoking is: More than 20 of every 100 adult men (20.5%) About 15 of every 100 adult women (15.3%) So how does this work out? 1/13 is 7.7% of all men 1/16 is 6.25% of all women Do some math and you will see that among non smoking men given the above numbers the rate is 1.39% and with smokers it would be 32.14% (assuming the 23x increase and the stated percentage of smokers, realistically since these are coming from different source I feel like it can't be that high) For women Nonsmokers 2.2% and smokers 28.65% (again assuming the 13x increase and stated percentage of smokers) 14.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Source: IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans ( http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Mo... ) Volume 83 (2004), Tobacco Smoke and Involuntary Smoking (specifically p. 167 in Chapter 2; there are also many other interesting charts on pp. 162-175, and useful tables from p. 177-263.  If a smoker quits by age fifty, then they still have a lifetime risk of over 5% of lung cancer alone.  Someone who continues smoking past that age has a much higher chance of lung cancer (up to 15% plus). On top of that, of course, smoking increases the risk of many other kinds of cancer besides lung cancer, though not quite as much; so you'd probably multiply these risks by another 50% or so to account for the increased risk of bladder cancer, kidney cancer, esophagus cancer, etc.  So let's say maybe 7-8% chance of smoking-related cancers for our hypothetical smoker who quit at 50, and maybe 20-25% for someone who smoked through his 70s. And that's all on the background of non-smoking-related cancers. 90.9k Views · View Upvoters · Not for Reproduction Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

What many smokers conveniently forget it that it's not just lung cancer they have to worry about. Smokers are also at higher risk for throat cancer, all other types of cancers, emphysema/COPD, heart disease, stroke, and premature aging.

The given responses to this question sound like there's not a lot of intent in giving the answer that would support an anti-smoking agenda. But let’s look at that 5%. If an epidemiological study was done where it was discovered that 5% of all smokers get lung cancer, it must be qualified by the length of smoking, the length of the study, and a count of the population of smokers where the number of new and former smokers don't change. Does the stat provide for all smokers for their entire lifespan and with a min /max duration? A 5% rate is not a longitudinal figure. If there are 100 smokers in a study and 5 get lung cancer, how is the length of smoking factored into the stat? How many will get cancer the next year and has that number been counted in the original 100 or will it be counted in the next batch of 100 studied? Are we talking over a 10 year period where people smoking for the entire 10 years, 5% will get cancer? Or 5% in any given year of anyone whose ever smoked for a year or 30 years? The stat needs to be qualified and P-values defined. Oversimplifying stats is as easy as dangerous. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters Quora User , studied at MIT School of Management, Pune Answered May 28, 2014 Originally Answered: Despite excess smoking, why do chain smokers not have lung cancer? Thanks for the A2A. The previous answer gives an extremely good understanding of how an individual CAN get lung cancer. Genetics, susceptiblity and exposure are the factors that determine if a person will get lung cancer. Some non smokers might get lung cancer after little exposure to cigarette/cigar smoke passively, while some people might smoke through their childhood and never have cancer.(My grandfather) The lungs are lined with cilia which move, attempting to clean out the lungs and push the tar and chemical deposits out of the body by mixing it with mucous. This cilia activity is high during the night/sleep-time. I read in a medical journal once that 4-5 years of non smoking sleep is how long it will take for the cilia to remove 90% of the deposits on the linings of the lungs for an average person. A person with healthy lungs and good lung capacity ( A person who gets good aerobic exercise daily) will have stronger lungs and faster rate of recovery of approx 3 years. However, recovery rate reduces with age so eventually their bodies will become more susceptible to cancer. These people seem to balance their bad habits with good and keep cancer at bay for a long enough time to convince the rest of the world that its okay to smoke. I am a heavy smoker and I am terrified that I might get cancer because Ive never had strong lungs/lung capacity since childhood. But I still (shamelessly) dont intend on quitting. I want to reduce my cigarette intake to once a week while maintaining good aerobic health everyday. Diseases like lung Cancer are abnormal and caused by unnatural habits. The people who maintain strong health dont seem to get it even if they indulge in the guilty pleasure occasionally or frequently. But its not a failsafe because we dont know our body completely and what the chinks in our genetic armor are. To sum up. Its not a high percentage of chain smokers who get cancer (and the possible reasons of that are stated above). But that does not mean I support or encourage smoking. 4.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Akhil Vatsa Quora User , Lifetime of scientific research.

The risk of lung cancer from not smoking is nearly 0 for most people. And considering that lung cancer has a high mortality rate, "only" 5% is horrific. I don't smoke, nor have I never smoked, but if there's something I do that increased my risk of cancer by "only 5%", I'd be stopping it tomorrow. 4.3k Views · View Upvoters   Michael J. McFadden , Have studied, analyzed, & written about hundreds of smoking-related medical studies. Updated Nov 12, 2015 · Author has 5.3k answers and 6.9m answer views Dane gave some good thinking about it, but I've always been disturbed by how well that number is "hidden."   Ever since the 1960s Antismoking materials always emphasize the "85% of lung cancer victims are smokers" type of approach, never stating the obverse statistic simply because it wouldn't be as powerful as propaganda. We see the same with regard to secondary smoke exposure.  I'm sure you've heard "According to the EPA exposure to secondhand smoke increases your chances of lung cancer by 19%." First of all, that statistic is questionable.  It was thrown out in federal court after being studied for almost four years by an antismoking federal judge because it was so weak and its derivation violated normal scientific standards.  However... even it it WAS true, it's just "half a statistic" -- just like the one about smoking itself and lung cancer.   The best figure I was able to come up with in my own research on this was about a 0.4% chance for a nonexposed nonsmoker to develop lung cancer in their lifetime.   So a 19% increase would mean that an exposed nonsmoker would have an extra (.19 x .4%) chance of cancer: 1/10th of 1% -- i.e. 1 extra chance in a thousand. Now the EPA figure is based upon, not simply "an exposure" to smoke, but upon 40 years or so of concentrated exposure in the workplaces of the 1940s through 1980s.  So another, and in some ways even more informative, way of looking at the figure would be to say "If you hung out or worked every workday of every week for forty years in very smoky conditions you'd have one extra chance in a thousand of getting lung cancer"  or... even more noticeable "One extra incidence of lung cancer for every 40,000 worker-years of exposure." Of course you'll almost never see a Mad Men type of smoke exposure in the US today, not even in most smoking bars and restaurants: we've simply become too accustomed to demanding a high level of ventilation where smoking occurs.  Before they were pressured by J. Samet and some other medical folks to change their stance, the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-conditioning Engineers, ASHRAE, recommended that to meet modern standards, smoking nightclubs or offices or conference meetings should generally have anywhere from 10 to either 20 or 30 air changes per hour (with filtration acting partially as counting toward air changes).   From my own memories of the 1960s I strongly doubt that places with smoking had ANYWHERE near those levels of air change back then.  Soooo... that one extra cancer for every 40,000 worker-years might be more like one extra lung cancer for every 80,000/160,000/320,000 worker-years today in better ventilated smoking situations! OK... went off on secondhand smoke there just to emphasize how strongly the propaganda effect of statistics can be tilted when you present only one "side" of the argument.  And that's what we've generally seen the Antismokers do with their "deaths from smoking" type stuff. Take another look at that 85% figure.  Think about what it would mean if 85% of the population were smokers!  It would mean absolutely ZERO! When the figure was first being promoted back in the 60s, the proportion of the adult population that was counted as smokers (i.e. anyone who thought they'd ever smoked at least five packs of cigarettes in their lifetime) was probably somewhere up around 65 to 70% -- so it wouldn't take much effect to increase a smokers' odds up to that 85%! Overall, I've never been able to track down any really good, trustworthy answers to your question.  I *think* the general chances if someone smokes a half pack to a pack a day through their life, is probably between 5% and 15% -- with the 15% or anything over it only coming about in special circumstances: e.g. asbestos exposure, workplace fumes, wok-cooking in huts, being a circus fire-eater, having a strong family history of lung cancer, living in a radon-filled basement, etc.  OR.... regardless of all those factors... simply living to be over 80 or 85 years old.   Absent errant meteorites, lightning bolts, and falls down the stairs or off of bicycles, most "old folks" are eventually going to get respiratory infections, cancer, or heart disease and die from it.  A smoker's chances of getting lung cancer between the ages of 25 and 45 might be only 1% (guessing here!), but between the ages of 70 and 90 it might go up to 15 or 20% (guessing here too!) even without other contributing factors! - MJM, not a doctor, only a blurry statistician, a roll-your-own smoker, and hoping to die from cancer or heart disease or, best of all, from great excitement during certain shared nocturnal athletic exercises -- all when I'm 103!  :> P.S. 113 would be even better! 6.2k Views · View Upvoters   Clark Eller , Not a Dr. But lots of personal experience Answered Feb 15, 2015 · Author has 239 answers and 197.2k answer views In males, the #1 diagnosed cancer is Prostate.  #2 is Lung.  Top cancer deaths #1 Lung, #2 Prostate.  If you would like to emphasize a lower risk to justify smoking, I would say just smoke if that's what you want.  But know that it will kill you in some way or other.  How can I make that claim?  The chemicals in the smoke go everywhere and affect the dna of all cells.  It may not be lung cancer to worry about.  Pick one of the thousands of cancers with ties to smoking, all of which are capable of killing you.

Knew I’d be dead in 10 if I did not quit ten years ago. You just have that feeling sometimes. Heart. I feel like I’ll make 100 now (usually). I can only add what I witnessed. Had four uncles who smoked and died in their 50s of heart attacks, one who smoked and went to his late 60s, two that are in their eighties now, and one that did not not smoke and is still kicking in his late 70s but has diabetes, I believe. So that’s 4 (or 5) out of 7 who smoked died too young. No one who did not smoke, including aunts, died young except one aunt who was financially ruined following the death of her smoking husband, but was also sedentary and very obese. Had at least one neighbor that continued to smoke even after his non-smoking wife died of lung cancer. Maybe it had nothing to do with second-hand smoke (but you and I know better). Come to think of it, my grandfather smoked cigars and died of esophageal cancer in his early seventies. The other did not smoke but devoured high cholesterol foods and died sixty years ago. Statistics be damned. Don’t deny family health histories and those of people living around you in a similar economic class or work environment. I’d rather you vape. Nicotine is an addictive stimulant but doesn’t cause illness or death unless you overdose on the stuff. You’ll feel plenty nauseous first. At least one depressed person tried to kill himself in a cousin’s smoking cessation program with nicotine patches but failed. I’ll bet he felt worse than dying going that route.

Malignancies are far more complicated than the average person thinks. A confluence of factors leads to a malignant clone of genetically altered cells which have the capacity to grow without normal human body restraints. The person must first be susceptible to genetic alterations caused by carcinogenic chemicals - of which there are dozens in tobacco / cigarette smoke. Then the immune system must drop its guard and allow that clone to grow. Over many years a lung carcinoma will grow until it is large enough to be seen on any x-rays or scans. Lung cancers must be even larger to cause any symptoms. Symptoms occur only in the very last, most advanced stages of the disease. By then it is too late. The barn door has long been open - all the horses have gone - and they have had baby horses already - before you find out. So, it is kind of gambling, and requires lots of things in place at once.

I wasn't quitting, I just quit. Quitting implied that I was still a smoker and that the process would take a long time. That wasn't true, I quit and that was that. I instantly became a non-smoker. Any ill feeling I had, and I had them in spades, was caused by the fact that I had smoked, it wasn't caused by not smoking. In other words, I had to think of myself as sick but getting better.

Action on smoking and health stated that 967 million people in 187 countries smoke every day. This figure was 721 million in 1980s. 5.7 million people die worldwide because of smoking. Studies have shown that there is an almost linear dose–response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked daily and the risk of developing.										Smoking at the rate of 10 cigarettes per day increases the risk of developing lung cancer 10-fold. In your case it will depend on how much you want to smoke in a day and how much you want consume in one year. However, beware that lung cancer have the lowest five years survival rate than any other cancers, and it can also spread to brain and other parts of the body.

Undo   Ammar Soghair , MD Answered May 20, 2016 · Author has 639 answers and 1.7m answer views Also keep in mind there is no such thing as a safer cigarette. The risk of lung cancer does increase with both the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years a person has smoked. A 35-year-old male who smokes fewer than 25 cigarettes per day is estimated to have a 9% lifetime chance of dying of lung cancer, whereas 25 cigarettes per day or more gives him an 18% lifetime chance of dying of lung cancer. There are some estimates that lifetime risk of lung cancer in a very heavy smoker is about 30% overall, whereas it is 1% or less in nonsmokers. This translates into about a third of very heavy smokers developing lung cancer. Also, 15 to 20 of every 100 patients who have lung cancer are lifelong nonsmokers. Some get it because of secondhand smoke and some get it for unknown reasons. People who start smoking at younger ages are at higher risk later in life. Lung cancer rates begin increasing in the mid to late 40s and peak in the late 70s. Many people think low tar or filtered cigarettes are safer. The truth is most people will compensate for these cigarettes by inhaling deeper and/or smoking more cigarettes in order to satisfy their need for nicotine. 2.3k Views   Josh Hill , audio and video engineer Answered Oct 24, 2017 · Author has 8.5k answers and 5.5m answer views Well, technically, you can get it even if you’ve never smoked at all, but in practice the risk from a year of smoking is zip. It takes about 10 pack years to significantly elevate your risk of lung cancer, which is to say one pack a day for 10 years, half a pack a day for 20 years, etc. The danger here as always is that one year of smoking will turn into 10 or 20. But given that you stopped successfully, there’s no reason to be concerned. 1.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Robert Andrew Marlon Brooks   Ann Austin , Nursed parents, husband, and brother thru final days. Have MS and raised kids. Answered May 21, 2016 · Author has 1.3k answers and 1.3m answer views It takes about 8 to 10 years but your lungs will totally clear from smoking. Any tar buildup in them will be gone and you will be like a non smoker. That might seem like a long time but I quit 15 years ago and haven't looked back. The effects of smoking are cumulative so you wouldn't expect to see anything until your 40's or 50's if you continue to smoke. Good luck. 2.3k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions Do you really develop cancer after smoking a year?

To understand how lung cancer starts, different types, how it affects your body and other lung cancer basics, visit our Learn About Lung Cancer section .    Mortality     Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S. In 1987, it surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. 1  An estimated 158,080 Americans are expected to die from lung cancer in 2016, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths. 2  The number of deaths caused by lung cancer peaked at 159,292 in 2005 and has since decreased by 2.3 percent to 155,610 in 2014. 1  The age-adjusted death rate for lung cancer is higher for men (51.7 per 100,000 persons) than for women (34.7 per 100,000 persons). It is similar for blacks (45.7 per 100,000 persons) and whites (45.4 per 100,000 persons) overall. However, black men have a far higher age-adjusted lung cancer death rate than white men, while black and white women have similar rates. 1       Prevalence and Incidence     Approximately 415,000 Americans living today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point in their lives. 3  During 2016, an estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer were expected to be diagnosed, representing about 13 percent of all cancer diagnoses. 2  The majority of living lung cancer patients have been diagnosed within the last five years. Lung cancer is mostly a disease of the elderly. In 2013, 83 percent of those living with lung cancer were 60 years of age or older. 3  In 2013, Kentucky had the highest age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rates in both men (113.2 per 100,000) and women (78.3 per 100,000). Utah had the lowest age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in both men and women (30.0 per 100,000 and 22.9 per 100,000, respectively). 4 These state-specific rates were parallel to smoking prevalence rates.  Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2012. 5  The National Institutes of Health estimate that cancer care cost the U.S. an overall $147.5 billion in 2015, $13.4 billion of which is due to lung cancer. Lost productivity due to early death from cancer lead to an additional $134.8 billion in 2005, $36.1 billion of which was caused by lung cancer. 6       Gender Differences     More men are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, but more women live with the disease. The rate of new cases in 2013 showed that men develop lung cancer more often than women (60.7 and 47.7 per 100,000, respectively). 3  The rate of new lung cancer cases (incidence) over the past 39 years has dropped 32 percent for men while it has risen 94 percent for women . In 1975, rates were low for women, but rising for both men and women. In 1984, the rate of new cases for men peaked (102.1 per 100,000) and then began declining. The rate of new cases for women increased further, did not peak until 1998 (52.9 per 100,000), and has now started to decline. 3       Racial/Ethnic Differences     Black men and women are more likely to develop and die from lung cancer than persons of any other racial or ethnic group. The age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rate among black men is approximately 28 percent higher than for white men, even though their overall exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor for lung cancer, is lower. 3, 7  The lung cancer incidence rate for black women is roughly equal to that of white women, despite the fact that they smoke fewer cigarettes. 3, 7       Survival Rates     What Does Survival Rate Mean?  Doctors use lung cancer survival rates or survival statistics to tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type and stage of cancer for a specific amount of time. It is based on population averages and is not a predictor of how long any one individual diagnosed with cancer will live. Learn more .    The lung cancer five-year survival rate (17.7 percent) is lower than many other leading cancer sites, such as the colon (64.4 percent), breast (89.7 percent) and prostate (98.9 percent). 3  The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 55 percent for cases detected when the disease is still localized (within the lungs). However, only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage. For distant tumors (spread to other organs) the five-year survival rate is only 4 percent. 3  More than half of people with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. 3        Screening and Early Detection     Screening for individuals at high risk has the potential to dramatically improve lung cancer survival rates by finding the disease at an earlier, more treatable stage.  A 2011 study found that screening high risk individuals with low-dose CT scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent compared to chest X-ray. 8  At least 8.6 million Americans qualify as high risk for lung cancer and are recommended to receive annual screening with low-dose CT scans. 9  If half of these high risk individuals were screened, over 13,000 lung cancer deaths could be prevented. 8,9       Smoking-Attributable Lung Cancer     Smoking , a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women are 13 times more likely, compared to never smokers. 10  Between 2005 and 2010, an average of 130,659 Americans (74,300 men and 56,359 women) died of smoking-attributable lung cancer each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 7,330 lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers every year. 11  Nonsmokers have a 20 to 30 percent greater chance of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work. 12       Other Causes     It has been estimated that active smoking is responsible for close to 90 percent of lung cancer cases; radon causes 10 percent, occupational exposures to carcinogens account for approximately 9 to 15 percent and outdoor air pollution 1 to 2 percent. Because of the interactions between exposures, the combined attributable risk for lung cancer can exceed 100 percent. 13  Exposure to radon is estimated to be the second-leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year (range of 8,000 to 45,000). Radon is a tasteless, colorless and odorless gas that is produced by decaying uranium and occurs naturally in soil and rock. The majority of these deaths occur among smokers since there is a greater risk for lung cancer when smokers also are exposed to radon. 14  Lung cancer can also be caused by occupational exposures, including asbestos , uranium and coke (an important fuel in the manufacture of iron in smelters, blast furnaces and foundries). The combination of asbestos exposure and smoking greatly increases the risk of developing lung cancer. 15  Nonsmoking asbes­tos workers are five times more likely to develop lung cancer than non­smokers not ex­posed to asbestos; if they also smoke, the risk factor jumps to 50 or higher. 13 Environmental exposures also can increase the risk of lung cancer death. 16     For more information, please review the Lung Cancer Morbidity and Mortality Trend Report call the Lung HelpLine at1-800-LUNGUSA (1-800-586-4872).

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80% to 85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.  Statistics for lung cancer include both small cell and NSCLC. This year, an estimated 222,500 adults (116,990 men and 105,510 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer. Black men are about 20% more likely to get lung cancer than white men. Black women are 10% less likely to get cancer when compared with white women.  Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death for men and women. It is estimated that 155,870 (84,590 men and 71,280 women) deaths from this disease will occur this year.  Lung cancer makes up 14% of all new cancer diagnoses and accounts for 1 in 4 cancer deaths. Due to a decrease in smoking, death rates have declined by 43% since 1990 in men and 17% in women since 2002.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for all people with lung cancer is 18%. The 5-year survival rate for men is 15%. The 5-year survival rate for women is 21%.  However, survival rates depend on several factors, including the subtype of lung cancer, and the stage of disease.  For people with stage IA and IB NSCLC, the 5-year survival rate is about 49% and 45% respectively. It is 30% for stage IIA cancer, and 31% for stage IIB cancer. For stage IIIA NSCLC, the 5-year survival rate is about 14%, and about 5% for stage IIIB. When NSCLC has spread outside of the lungs, it can be difficult to treat. The 5-year survival rate for stage IV NSCLC is around 1%.  Each year, tens of thousands of people are cured of NSCLC in the United States. And, some patients with advanced lung cancer can live many years after diagnosis. Sometimes patients who are told that their lung cancer is incurable live longer than many who are told that their lung cancer is curable. The important thing to remember is that lung cancer is treatable at any stage, and these treatments have been proven to help people with lung cancer live longer with better quality of life.  Furthermore, it is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with NSCLC are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. It is not an estimate of how long a person is likely to live with cancer. People should talk with their doctor if they have questions about this information. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatments that have become widely available in the past 5 years. Learn more about understanding statistics .

Incidence Rates by Race/Ethnicity and Sex  “Incidence rate” means how many people out of a given number get the disease each year. The graph below shows how many people out of 100,000 got lung cancer each year during the years 1999–2014. The year 2014 is the most recent year for which numbers have been reported. The lung cancer incidence rate is grouped by race and ethnicity.  The graph below shows that in 2014, among men, black men had the highest rate of getting lung cancer, followed by white, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI), and Hispanic men. Among women, white women had the highest rate of getting lung cancer, followed by black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic women.

More in Lung Cancer        Causes & Risk Factors       Non-Small Cell     Small Cell     Symptoms     Diagnosis     Treatment     Living With     Support & Coping        We know that smoking causes lung cancer, but it’s also clear that some people smoke their whole lives and never develop lung cancer. So, what percentage of smokers actually get lung cancer? How much does that risk decrease if you quit? Smoking and Lung Cancer Most statistics look at the overall risk of lung cancer , combining both people who smoke and those who have never smoked. Based on United States statistics, the lifetime risk that a person will develop lung cancer is 6.4 percent or a little greater than one out of every 15 people.         Clearly, this number would be higher for those who have smoked and lower for those who haven't. We have very few studies which have broken these numbers down between never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers, but an older 2006 European study did make these distinctions. In that study, the risk of developing lung cancer was: 0.2 percent for men who never smoked; 0.4 percent for women 5.5 percent of male former smokers; 2.6 percent in women 15.9 percent of current male smokers; 9.5 percent for women 24.4 percent for male “heavy smokers” defined as smoking more than five cigarettes per day; 18.5 percent for women An earlier Canadian study quoted the lifetime risk for male smokers at 17.2 percent and 11.6 percent in women versus only 1.3 percent in male non-smokers and 1.4 percent in female non-smokers . Leading Cause of Cancer-Related Deaths To properly address why this question is so important, it's important to point out that smoking is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and women in the United States.   One out of four cancer deaths is due to lung cancer and lung cancer kills more people than breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer combined. Of these cancers, it's thought that at least 80 percent can be attributed to smoking. There are many chemicals in cigarettes that are known to cause cancer and more which are considered toxic to humans.         It's not only lung cancer, however. There are many cancers which are caused by smoking . And it's not just smoking that's a problem, it's thought that roughly 7300 people die from lung cancer each year caused by second-hand smoke. Lung Cancer Risk in People Who Smoke It appears that the earlier in life you begin smoking, the higher your risk of developing lung cancer. Your risk also depends on the number of “ pack-years ” you have smoked. A pack-year is a number that is calculated by multiplying the number of years smoked times the number of packs of cigarettes smoked daily. Quitting smoking lowers the risk of lung cancer, but it can take some time before your risk decreases. If you have smoked for more than a short period of time, your risk will never reach that of a never smoker. But, it is still very worth the effort to quit. Researchers looking at people in Asia and Australia found that people could reduce their risk of developing lung cancer by up to 70 percent by quitting smoking. In one estimate, a 68-year-old man who had smoked two packs per day for 50 years (100 pack-years) had a 15 percent risk of developing lung cancer in the next 10 years if he continued to smoke. This risk would drop to 10.8 percent if he quit smoking.         You may also be wondering how cutting down but not quitting impacts risk. In one study, it was found that people who smoked more than 15 cigarettes per day could significantly lower their risk if they cut the number of cigarettes they smoked daily in half. Another study was less positive about the cutting down approach and suggested that quitting altogether was necessary to bring about a significant difference in risk. Lung Cancer in Former Smokers As noted above, the risk of lung cancer rarely returns to normal when a person quits smoking. In fact, roughly 80 percent of people who develop lung cancer today are non-smokers; they either never smoked or more commonly quit smoking in the past (are former smokers.)  Predicting Risk While it is impossible to truly predict who will develop lung cancer, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has developed a Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool in which you can calculate your average risk of developing lung cancer in the next 10 years based on your age and how long you had or have smoked. The tool is designed for people between the ages of 50 and 75 who smoked between 10 and 60 cigarettes daily for a period of 25 and 55 years. It is preceded by a disclaimer that reminds individuals that the tool is only a prediction based on statistics and does not mean someone will or will not develop lung cancer. Screening Until recently, there had not been an effective screening test for lung cancer. People needed to rely on an awareness of the early symptoms of lung cancer in hope of finding the disease in the early and most treatable stages of the disease. Since nearly half of people are diagnosed when their lung cancer is already in the advanced stages, a knowledge of symptoms alone isn't enough. Thankfully—for some people at least— CT lung cancer screening has been approved and, when used according to guidelines, may decrease the mortality from lung cancer by 20 percent in the United States. People eligible for screening include those who: Are between the ages of 55 and 80 Have a 30 pack-year history of smoking Continue to smoke or quit smoking in the past 15 years Are in reasonable physical condition such that surgery could be done if a mass is found There are other people who may wish to be screened as well. For example, those who have been exposed to cancer-causing substances in the work place. If you feel you may be at risk, talk to your doctor. Even if you smoked, it's not too late to do other things to lower your risk of developing lung cancer . A Word From Verywell If you smoke or have smoked you might be feeling discouraged. It might help to look at these statistics from a different angle. Instead of fretting that your risk of lung cancer doesn't disappear, you might instead focus on the fact that 10 years after quitting your risk is only half of what it is today. It is never too late to quit. Even for those who have cancer, quitting can make a difference. You might be interested in checking out these reasons to quit smoking after a diagnosis of cancer . In addition to giving up the habit, there are other ways you can reduce your chances of dying from cancer. Eating healthy, having an active lifestyle, and getting screened if you qualify can all help.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer             Key Statistics for Lung Cancer       Most lung cancer statistics include both small cell and non-small cell lung cancers.  How common is lung cancer?  Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer ). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers.  The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:   About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)  About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)   Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon , breast, and prostate cancers combined.  Lung cancer mainly occurs in older people. Mostpeople diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older, while a very small number of people diagnosed younger than 45. The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 70.  Lifetime chance of getting lung cancer  Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 15; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 17. These numbers include both smokers and non-smokers. For smokers the risk is much higher, while for non-smokers the risk is lower.  Black men are about 20% more likely to develop lung cancer than white men. The rate is about 10% lower in black women than in white women. Both black and white women have lower rates than men, but the gap is closing. The lung cancer rate has been dropping among men over the past few decades, but only for about the last decade in women.  Statistics on survival in people with lung cancer vary depending on the stage (extent) of the cancer when it is diagnosed. For survival statistics based on the stage of the cancer, see Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Survival Rates By Stage .  Despite the very serious prognosis (outlook) of lung cancer, some people with earlier stage cancers are cured. More than 430,000 people alive today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point.  Visit the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

To understand how lung cancer starts, different types, how it affects your body and other lung cancer basics, visit our Learn About Lung Cancer section .    Mortality     Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S. In 1987, it surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. 1  An estimated 158,080 Americans are expected to die from lung cancer in 2016, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths. 2  The number of deaths caused by lung cancer peaked at 159,292 in 2005 and has since decreased by 2.3 percent to 155,610 in 2014. 1  The age-adjusted death rate for lung cancer is higher for men (51.7 per 100,000 persons) than for women (34.7 per 100,000 persons). It is similar for blacks (45.7 per 100,000 persons) and whites (45.4 per 100,000 persons) overall. However, black men have a far higher age-adjusted lung cancer death rate than white men, while black and white women have similar rates. 1       Prevalence and Incidence     Approximately 415,000 Americans living today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point in their lives. 3  During 2016, an estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer were expected to be diagnosed, representing about 13 percent of all cancer diagnoses. 2  The majority of living lung cancer patients have been diagnosed within the last five years. Lung cancer is mostly a disease of the elderly. In 2013, 83 percent of those living with lung cancer were 60 years of age or older. 3  In 2013, Kentucky had the highest age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rates in both men (113.2 per 100,000) and women (78.3 per 100,000). Utah had the lowest age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in both men and women (30.0 per 100,000 and 22.9 per 100,000, respectively). 4 These state-specific rates were parallel to smoking prevalence rates.  Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2012. 5  The National Institutes of Health estimate that cancer care cost the U.S. an overall $147.5 billion in 2015, $13.4 billion of which is due to lung cancer. Lost productivity due to early death from cancer lead to an additional $134.8 billion in 2005, $36.1 billion of which was caused by lung cancer. 6       Gender Differences     More men are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, but more women live with the disease. The rate of new cases in 2013 showed that men develop lung cancer more often than women (60.7 and 47.7 per 100,000, respectively). 3  The rate of new lung cancer cases (incidence) over the past 39 years has dropped 32 percent for men while it has risen 94 percent for women . In 1975, rates were low for women, but rising for both men and women. In 1984, the rate of new cases for men peaked (102.1 per 100,000) and then began declining. The rate of new cases for women increased further, did not peak until 1998 (52.9 per 100,000), and has now started to decline. 3       Racial/Ethnic Differences     Black men and women are more likely to develop and die from lung cancer than persons of any other racial or ethnic group. The age-adjusted lung cancer incidence rate among black men is approximately 28 percent higher than for white men, even though their overall exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor for lung cancer, is lower. 3, 7  The lung cancer incidence rate for black women is roughly equal to that of white women, despite the fact that they smoke fewer cigarettes. 3, 7       Survival Rates     What Does Survival Rate Mean?  Doctors use lung cancer survival rates or survival statistics to tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type and stage of cancer for a specific amount of time. It is based on population averages and is not a predictor of how long any one individual diagnosed with cancer will live. Learn more .    The lung cancer five-year survival rate (17.7 percent) is lower than many other leading cancer sites, such as the colon (64.4 percent), breast (89.7 percent) and prostate (98.9 percent). 3  The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 55 percent for cases detected when the disease is still localized (within the lungs). However, only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage. For distant tumors (spread to other organs) the five-year survival rate is only 4 percent. 3  More than half of people with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. 3        Screening and Early Detection     Screening for individuals at high risk has the potential to dramatically improve lung cancer survival rates by finding the disease at an earlier, more treatable stage.  A 2011 study found that screening high risk individuals with low-dose CT scans could reduce lung cancer mortality by 20 percent compared to chest X-ray. 8  At least 8.6 million Americans qualify as high risk for lung cancer and are recommended to receive annual screening with low-dose CT scans. 9  If half of these high risk individuals were screened, over 13,000 lung cancer deaths could be prevented. 8,9       Smoking-Attributable Lung Cancer     Smoking , a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women are 13 times more likely, compared to never smokers. 10  Between 2005 and 2010, an average of 130,659 Americans (74,300 men and 56,359 women) died of smoking-attributable lung cancer each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 7,330 lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers every year. 11  Nonsmokers have a 20 to 30 percent greater chance of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work. 12       Other Causes     It has been estimated that active smoking is responsible for close to 90 percent of lung cancer cases; radon causes 10 percent, occupational exposures to carcinogens account for approximately 9 to 15 percent and outdoor air pollution 1 to 2 percent. Because of the interactions between exposures, the combined attributable risk for lung cancer can exceed 100 percent. 13  Exposure to radon is estimated to be the second-leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year (range of 8,000 to 45,000). Radon is a tasteless, colorless and odorless gas that is produced by decaying uranium and occurs naturally in soil and rock. The majority of these deaths occur among smokers since there is a greater risk for lung cancer when smokers also are exposed to radon. 14  Lung cancer can also be caused by occupational exposures, including asbestos , uranium and coke (an important fuel in the manufacture of iron in smelters, blast furnaces and foundries). The combination of asbestos exposure and smoking greatly increases the risk of developing lung cancer. 15  Nonsmoking asbes­tos workers are five times more likely to develop lung cancer than non­smokers not ex­posed to asbestos; if they also smoke, the risk factor jumps to 50 or higher. 13 Environmental exposures also can increase the risk of lung cancer death. 16     For more information, please review the Lung Cancer Morbidity and Mortality Trend Report call the Lung HelpLine at1-800-LUNGUSA (1-800-586-4872).

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

Author information 1 Bureau of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Tunney's Pasture, Ottawa, Ontario. Abstract Life table methodology was used to estimate the probability of developing lung cancer by smoking status. Lifetime risks of developing lung cancer were estimated for six hypothetical cohorts (males, females, male current smokers, male never smokers, female current smokers, and female never smokers). Estimates of smoking mortality and incidence rates were calculated based on Canadian rates observed over the period 1987 to 1989. It was found that 172/1,000 of male current smokers will eventually develop lung cancer; the similar probability among female current smokers was 116/1,000. For those who never smoked on a regular basis the lifetime risk was substantially reduced. Only 13/1,000 males and 14/1,000 females in this category will develop lung cancer. When smoking status is not adjusted for, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is approximately 96/1,000 and 43/1,000 for males and females respectively.

Smoking  Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States, cigarette smoking is linked to about 80% to 90% of lung cancers. Using other tobacco products such as cigars or pipes also increases the risk for lung cancer. Tobacco smoke is a toxic mix of more than 7,000 chemicals. Many are poisons. At least 70 are known to cause cancer in people or animals.  People who smoke cigarettes are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke. Even smoking a few cigarettes a day or smoking occasionally increases the risk of lung cancer. The more years a person smokes and the more cigarettes smoked each day, the more risk goes up.  People who quit smoking have a lower risk of lung cancer than if they had continued to smoke, but their risk is higher than the risk for people who never smoked. Quitting smoking at any age can lower the risk of lung cancer.  Cigarette smoking can cause cancer almost anywhere in the body. Cigarette smoking causes cancer of the mouth and throat, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, voicebox (larynx), trachea, bronchus, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, and cervix, and causes acute myeloid leukemia.   Secondhand Smoke  Smoke from other people’s cigarettes, pipes, or cigars ( secondhand smoke ) also causes lung cancer. When a person breathes in secondhand smoke, it is like he or she is smoking. In the United States, two out of five adults who don’t smoke and half of children are exposed to secondhand smoke, and about 7,300 people who never smoked die from lung cancer due to secondhand smoke every year.   Radon  Radon is a naturally occurring gas that comes from rocks and dirt and can get trapped in houses and buildings. It cannot be seen, tasted, or smelled. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon causes about 20,000 cases of lung cancer each year, making it the second leading cause of lung cancer. Nearly one out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is thought to have high radon levels. The EPA recommends testing homes for radon and using proven ways to lower high radon levels.  Other Substances  Examples of substances found at some workplaces that increase risk include asbestos,  arsenic,  diesel exhaust, and some forms of silica and chromium. For many of these substances, the risk of getting lung cancer is even higher for those who smoke.   Personal or Family History of Lung Cancer  If you are a lung cancer survivor, there is a risk that you may develop another lung cancer, especially if you smoke. Your risk of lung cancer may be higher if your parents, brothers or sisters, or children have had lung cancer. This could be true because they also smoke, or they live or work in the same place where they are exposed to radon and other substances that can cause lung cancer.   Radiation Therapy to the Chest  Cancer survivors who had radiation therapy to the chest are at higher risk of lung cancer.   Diet  Scientists are studying many different foods and dietary supplements to see whether they change the risk of getting lung cancer. There is much we still need to know. We do know that smokers who take beta-carotene supplements have increased risk of lung cancer. For more information, visit Lung Cancer Prevention.  Also, arsenic in drinking water (primarily from private wells) can increase the risk of lung cancer. For more information, visit the EPA’s Arsenic in Drinking Water.       What Is Lung Cancer?

Our experts developed a screening decision tool to help you better understand your risk.  Learn more     Smoking, the number one cause of preventable death in the United States, causes 130,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Many smokers are now considering screening with low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) scans in the hope of diagnosing the disease early. A new study that shows lung cancer risk varies widely among smokers may help individuals and their doctors decide if voluntary screening is appropriate for them.  Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center analyzed data from a large lung cancer prevention study and found that the risk of developing lung cancer can be accurately predicted based on a person’s age, sex, and smoking history. These factors accounted for an individual’s 10-year risk for developing lung cancer which ranged from a low of less than 1% to a high of 16%. The study, along with an interactive lung cancer risk prediction tool, is published in the March 19 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute .  “The risk assessment tool should help physicians and patients balance the possible risks and benefits of screening,” explained Peter Bach , M.D. of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering and the study’s first author. “For example, the subjects in our study who were at the low end of risk had less than a 1% chance of getting lung cancer in the next ten years. That needs to be contrasted with the 30 to 50 percent risk that a screening CT will show some lung scar or shadow that requires further evaluation or surgical biopsy, even though it will ultimately be deemed to be harmless.  “The researchers reviewed the information from a lung cancer prevention study called the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) conducted by investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. This randomized, multi-center trial looked at the effect of beta-carotene and Vitamin A supplements on lung cancer prevention in 18,314 people. The subjects included 14,254 men and women aged 50 to 69 who were considered heavy smokers - defined as having smoked at least one pack per day for 20 years and who were either current smokers or had stopped smoking within 6 years prior to enrolling in the study. The remaining 4060 participants were asbestos exposed men aged 45 to 69 who were either current smokers or former smokers who quit within 15 years of enrollment. The trial was terminated in 1996 after preliminary results indicated no benefit and possible harm from the supplements among individuals who continued to smoke cigarettes.  For the new study, the data from 18,172 subjects in the CARET trial who had a history of current or former smoking were used to create a mathematical model that predicts the likelihood that an individual will be diagnosed with lung cancer within the next ten years.For the risk prediction model, the duration of smoking, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, duration of abstinence, and age turned out to be the main factors that determined the probability of an individual being diagnosed with lung cancer. Looking at examples from people undergoing lung cancer screening, a 51-year-old woman who smoked one pack per day for 29 years but stopped smoking 9 years earlier had a 0.8% (less than 1 in a 100) risk of getting lung cancer in the next ten years while a 68-year-old man who smoked two packs a day for the past 50 years and continued to smoke had a 15% (1 out of 7) chance of developing the disease in the same time period.  “Our findings suggest that accurate risk prediction may also be useful for researchers designing clinical trials of early lung cancer diagnosis,” said Colin Begg , Ph.D., chairman of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering and senior author of the study. “For example, focusing on the truly high-risk individuals may allow for more effective clinical trials of lung cancer screening and prevention.”  Mark G. Kris , M.D., chief of Thoracic Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering and one of the study’s co-authors, believes the new model will be a valuable tool in assessing risk. “Using the new model, we have a much better way to predict who is at high risk for developing lung cancer and, equally important, who is at a lower risk. With more than 90 million current and former smokers in the U.S., we need an accurate way to identify those individuals at exceptionally high risk who have the most to gain from screening.”  The study’s co-authors include Michael W. Kattan, Ph.D., Ramsey C. Tate and Lillian J. Hsieh of Memorial Sloan Kettering; Mark D. Thornquist, Ph.D. and Matt J. Barnett, M.S. of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The study was funded by the “Steps for Breath Fund” from The Society of Memorial Sloan Kettering and by a Public Health Service grant from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.
