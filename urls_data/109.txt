Reuters Eras aren't what they used to be. Anthony Davis, the fabulously talented 6'10'' forward of the Kentucky Wildcats national championship team, an era was just one season. Davis and probably two of his "one-and-done" freshman teammates will be bolting for the NBA. On Draft Day, Thursday, June 28, Davis—by consensus the year's best college basketball player—forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and point guard Marcus Teague will head for the pros, and a new batch of blue-chip studs recruited by Kentucky coach John Calipari for the sole purpose of playing just one year will be poised to take their places. The NBA has a rule that requires players to be 19 years old or have completed one year of college before becoming eligible for the NBA Draft. The rule was instituted in 2007, a delayed reaction to LeBron James having skipped college altogether and gone straight from high school to the pros in 2003, proving that for the truly elite players the transition was not hard. The NCAA, though, and the NBA don't like the idea of players skipping college ball and want to do something about it. Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA and the latest wet blanket to be dropped on college sports by its ruling body, sat on a panel discussion just before the start of the NCAA tournament and said, "I happened to dislike the one-and-done rule enormously and wish it didn't exist. I think it forces young men to go to college who have little or no interest in going to college."  MORE ON SPORTS        The Shame of College Sports          An Agent's Plan for Fixing College Sports          Should College Athletes Get Paid? Ending the Debate, Once and for All          Confessions of a College-Basketball Benchwarmer          How Title IX Hurts Female Athletes          Joe Paterno's Disappointing Last Decade at Penn State    I hate to take a cynical note on this, but I don't think Emmert or anyone else in the NCAA really cares about young men going to college—or at least attending college classes. I think what they care about is whether or not these young men play college basketball, and I think what they would like is to have the NBA's cooperation in doing anything they can to keep boys playing college basketball for as long as they can. The simple reality is that most basketball and football players who wind up in the pros had little or no interest in going to college in the first place. They want to be first in line for the professional drafts that will take them away from the world of amateur sham, very reasonably wanting their talents to produce revenue for themselves and their families instead of university athletic departments. Now, when the boys are in the best position to make that pay for them, colleges pretending to show some concern. "It makes a travesty," said Emmert, "of the whole notion of student as an athlete." One might call that poetic justice since for nearly a century colleges have been making a travesty of the notion of athlete as student. Emmert was a guest on NBC Sports' Costas Tonight Wednesday night, trying to convince Bob Costas and the nation that he is the leader of an organization bent on reforming college sports. So why is Emmert so against the one-and-done rule? "It simply creates the wrong type of environment for us," he said. "If you're coming to us to be a collegiate athlete, we want you to be a collegiate athlete." In his own double-talking way, Emmert was actually expressing the truth, or at least a version of it. What he meant was that if a player—for the sake of argument, let's say his name is Anthony Davis—attends a prestigious basketball school like Kentucky for one year and the moves on to the pros, it's Davis and not college basketball who gets the most benefit. For decades the heart of college basketball's appeal has been the fans' delight in watching a player grow and mature into a great talent over three and, in some cases, even four seasons. With so many players leaving school so soon to go to the pros, the appeal of the game has eroded. Regular-season college basketball TV ratings and attendance have been slipping now for several years. Not coincidentally, the NBA has also suffered from an overall ratings slump and slightly declining attendance over the last few years, suffering from a dearth of well-known superstars who aren't named Kobe or LeBron. Commissioner David Stern has expressed some enthusiasm for having the league owners pass a new rule which would require a two-year minimum wait between high school and the NBA—in other words, future Anthony Davises would be forced to spend at least one more year playing basketball for free before getting a chance to cash in. Why does the NBA care how long players stay in college or whether they are in college at all? For the simple reason that college basketball doesn't depend on the existence of the pros, but the pros could not exist without the colleges. Not only does the NBA pay not a dime in player development, it has always benefitted enormously from the fact that its best players were already household names by the time they were drafted. It costs the NBA nothing to wait another year or two to get the players and works much to their advantage if they're even more famous when they put on an NBA uniform. After all, the boom era of the NBA began in 1978 when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird were drafted, respectively, by the rival LA Lakers and Boston Celtics—after having faced each other in the highest-rated NCAA final up to that time between Michigan State and Indiana State. Note that one never hears about the NCAA and NBA getting together to make pronouncements on this subject; that would seem too much like collusion. One might call their relationship, as Dana Carvey's Church Lady used to say, conveeenient . After all, there's no need for conspiracy when both parties are in agreement.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

Robinson Meyer      How to find out if you are one of the 87 million victims   Facebook has begun to notify users who were affected by the Cambridge Analytica data breach. If you or one of your friends installed the personality-quiz app “This Is Your Digital Life” prior to 2015, then some of your data illicitly made it to the servers of the voter-profiling company.  If your data was ensnared in the breach, you’re not alone. I’m also one of Cambridge Analytica’s victims. (If you’re not sure whether you were affected, you can go to this Facebook page , which will tell you if your information was shared.)

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.

Madrigal      Inside Uber’s latest attempt to rebuild its app for drivers, the biggest experiment in the gig economy.   Every day, the world’s 3 million Uber drivers spend 8.5 million hours logged into the ride-hailing company’s app. That’s roughly 1,000 years of Uber driving packed into any given 24 hours.  Because of this tremendous scale, Uber is the most important test case for the gig economy, the new economic arrangement where contract workers are arranged into a cohesive labor force by software. There are many companies that share Uber’s controversial approach to doling out work, but none has amassed 3 million people who use the service to try to make money. Never before has an app’s design been so important to so many people.  The Uber app is the drivers’ workplace, as much as the city where they’re driving is. Each decision about its interface structures drivers’ interactions with Uber the company as well as Uber the transportation marketplace. And Uber is now putting the finishing touches on a from-scratch rebuild of the driver app.    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

In this twelve-year span, Kevin Garnett received $28,000,000, which was the highest salary payment of any NBA player, during the 2003–04 season . Garnett has been the highest-paid NBA player per year in seven of the past twelve NBA seasons. Michael Jordan was the first NBA player to sign a contract worth over thirty million dollars in a season. During the 1997–98 season , Jordan earned $33,140,000, which still stands as the most any NBA player has earned on a 1 year contract, Jordan also holds the record for the second largest 1 year contract at $30,140,000 in the 96-97 season.. Kobe Bryant become just the second player to reach this milestone when the 2013–14 season began. [1]  LeBron James became the third in the 2016–17 season . Stephen Curry became the first player to eclipse $40-Million per year when he signed a record 5-year contract worth $201-Million in 2017, starting with $34,682,550 in the 2017-18 season and ending with the largest earnings in the 2021-22 season with a record payout of $45,780,966.   Beginning in the 1984–85 NBA season , the NBA's first salary cap was introduced. The NBA salary cap is the maximum dollar amount each NBA team can spend on its players for the season. However, the NBA uses a "soft" salary cap, which means that significant "salary exceptions" allow NBA teams to exceed their allotted amount in order to sign players. The salary cap is determined during the offseason , but as stated earlier, it is liable to change. [2]      Michael Jordan , who earned $33,140,000 in the 1997–98 NBA season , attempts a slam dunk at the old Boston Garden .    An exception is necessary to sign a player for a contract that would exceed the salary cap threshold of the "soft cap". The Larry Bird exception , more commonly known as Bird Rights, allows teams to re-sign a current player only if he has played for that particular team for a minimum of three years. [3] Another exception known as the mid-level exception allows for teams that are over the salary cap to sign one or more players as long as they do not exceed the total amount of the average NBA salary. [4] Next, the bi-annual exception can be used by teams every other year to sign a free agent(s) for up to two years at an amount set by the NBA. [5] Finally, the rookie player exception allows any NBA team to sign their first-round draft pick to a contract based upon a scale previously set forth by the NBA. Another option for teams would be to assign players to a league-assigned minimum salary contract for a maximum of two years.  According to 2010–11 NBA season game performance, the league's best players were not its highest-paid players. Each year there are ten players selected to one of the two All-NBA Teams . Out of those ten players chosen that year, Kobe Bryant was the only player that was also among the game's ten highest-paid during the 2010–11 NBA season.

Basketball players on a court  Photo Credit: Andersen Ross/Blend Images/Getty Images          Statistics provide a snapshot of information, and often apply only to the time period for which the statistics are gathered. However, a snapshot can be useful, especially if your child is proving to be a phenomenal basketball player. While the numbers may vary, the percentage of high school players who make it the NBA is always very small. Keep in mind that a 2006 rule requires that players who participate in the draft are at least one year out of high school and must be at least 19 to play.   Video of the Day             Probability of Being Drafted  Male players are drafted into the National Basketball Association and female players are drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association. According to the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, neither have a very high probability of being drafted. For men, about three out of 10,000 male high school basketball players will be drafted into the NBA, or about .03 percent. For women, the numbers are similar. One out of 5,000 players, or .02 percent, will be drafted into the WNBA.            Longevity in the Sport  If you evaluate this statistic as information for your high school player, keep in mind a few other intriguing statistics. Just 10.6 percent of the 2010-11 rosters include players who have just one year of experience. Players with four or fewer years of experience make up the largest part of the team rosters at 52.1 percent. Only 10.6 percent of players have more than four years of experience, which makes a long-term career in the NBA a long shot for most players.  Plan for the Worst  If your high school player is drafted for the NBA at age 19 or after one or two years of college, he can still get a college education. An October 2009 article in "The New York Times" covered the return of many NBA players to college during the offseason. Many players and coaches consider returning to college a smart move for a player. The rigors of professional sports and chance of basketball-ending injuries make a college or vocational education essential for a good career after the NBA.  Benefits of Team Sports  The good news is that team sports of almost any variety are very healthy for kids, regardless of their professional aspirations. Beyond the physical benefits, which can be significant given the spiraling statistics in childhood obesity levels, youth sports also provide significant social and emotional benefits. Youth players, regardless of gender, have stronger social development skills, moral development and are less likely to engage in gang behavior.                       Lose Weight. Feel Great!

Whether you’re in middle school, high school, or college, setting your sights on the NBA can only improve your game, so don’t be afraid to dream big.         Steps    Part 1   Playing Your Best           1   Practice shooting from everywhere on the court. Practice shooting at close range, longer range and then 3-point range so you become a dexterous, well-rounded shooter. It can help to work on your shooting ability in continuous three-week rotations, spending one week working on each type of shot. You can never be too precise. [1]   Try to maintain a strong shooting average: At least 60% average from the 2-point field goal, 40% from 3-point line and 75% from free throw line. [2]             2   Record video of yourself playing in basketball games. Watching your body move when you make good baskets and when you miss can help you tweak things that are off and improve your game. If you’re in middle or high school, have a friend or parent attend a game to help you record some video footage. If you’re in college, many teams have media assistants who record games for the university. Ask your coach if you can review some game footage.  It can be helpful to compile your best footage from these games into a highlight reel for potential NBA recruiters, if you are in college. Edit the video to keep lagging moments to a minimum and keep your video under 5 minutes. [3]            3   Play with people who are better than you are. You become a stronger and more strategic basketball player when you are challenged by someone whose skills are superior to yours. Elevate your game by regularly scrimmaging other players who push you to be better. If you are in high school and are already the best basketball player you know, try to join a local AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) team to find people whose playing ability really pushes you to a new level. [4]   Top AAU teams are tracked by prominent college recruiters and are one of the top ways to get athletic scholarships. These regional teams attract top players from many high schools, so recruiters like to visit them to see a bigger pool of talented kids. Dwight Howard, Kobe Bryant and Josh Smith, for example, all grew up playing AAU basketball. You can find an AAU club in your area at aausports.org.           4   Amp up the difficulty of your drills. Add some intensity to normal running and practice drills by increasing their difficulty. You could try running in sand or dribbling in gravel. Doing this will make your skills sharper and increase your endurance. You can do this whether you’re in middle school, high school or college.         5   Start a strength-training regimen to build muscle. Increasing your physical strength will enable you to make shots from farther away and muscle around people who guard you. Start a strength-training regimen with a coach who has an understanding of basketball. They can tailor your exercises to your body and your sport’s specific needs. [5]   If you are in high school, contact your school’s athletic director and ask if they can connect you with a lifting coach who has basketball experience.  If you are in college, your school likely already has strength-training experts on staff. Contact your athletic administrator to see if you can book some one-on-one sessions with a personal trainer.           6   Increase your endurance by implementing healthy habits. Basketball requires lots of running up and down the court, so it is imperative to maintain your physical condition so you can play your best from the beginning of the game to the end. Staying well hydrated, getting 8 hours of sleep a night, and eating healthy foods will all help your body function optimally and increase your endurance. [6]                Part 2   Standing Out From the Crowd          1   Find the right coach. If you’re in middle school or high school, your school basketball team likely has a coach already. If you’re not getting much individual attention from that coach though and feel really passionately about improving your basketball game, consider hiring a private coach. A private coach can give you personalized feedback to help you grow more quickly as a player and work on weak areas of your game.  Coachup.com can connect you with a private skilled basketball tutor in your area.  Working with a coach one-on-one enables you to build a more intimate mentor-mentee relationship. When interviewing potential private coaches, look for someone you have good rapport with and whose accomplishments you respect. It is a bonus if they have connections with influential recruiters.           2   Use every skill you have to your advantage. If you have a playing skill that is particularly strong, make it your own. There are lots of great basketball players, but you’ll need to distinguish yourself from the pack as a specialist in one area if you want to be in the NBA.  If you are particularly fast, for example, try to bring speed to every skill you perform on the court. People will notice that this is a unique strength of yours as a player.           3   Be a leader on and off the court. Attitude matters. A basketball team can’t function with a roster full of prima donnas because it is a team sport. Make yourself appealing to prospective recruiters by being a leader and exemplary person both on the off the court. Everyone wants a player who will get along with others and inspire the team to be better. [7]   Learning from your mistakes and setting a high standard are two great ways you can step up your leadership game.  Don’t be afraid to approach your coach at school, whether high school or college, and ask if there’s a way to assume more responsibility on the team.           4   Play as many tournaments as possible. Getting in front of talent scouts from major universities (if you are in high school) and NBA teams (if you are in college) are key to advancing in your basketball career. Attend as many tournaments as possible, as these are places important coaches and influencers go to see and select the next generation of players. The more influential people who see you play the better. [8]   If you’re in high school, many AAU leagues participate in regional tournaments your school may not. You don’t need to sign up for anything extra, but the schedule can be grueling on top of your other commitments. If playing in the NBA is really your dream, try to attend as many as you can.  If you’re in college, your school basketball team already participates in all the right tournaments. Make the most of recruiting opportunities at regional conference tournaments and March Madness by playing the best you possibly can.            Part 3   Positioning Yourself for Professional Play          1   Make your high school team so you can get onto a college team. You must be 19 to play in the NBA, and most players are drafted out of college. Excel to the best of your ability in high school and AAU basketball, so you can play at a competitive basketball school such as Duke, Kentucky, or North Carolina. Top NBA recruiters usually only consider players from Division 1 basketball programs. [9]   A private basketball coach can help step up your game if you’re not where you need to be.  If you’re in high school, good grades will help round you out as a full “package” and make you more attractive as a student-athlete. Think like a recruiter: You want to be an easy sell to whomever they need to make your case to. If you need an academic tutor to bring your grades up, contact your dean’s office. They can connect you with a tutor who will meet your needs.  Most high school and college coaches will have a good sense of which recruiters will be at specific games or showcases. Ask your coach if they have any information about this, if you’re hoping to connect with someone.           2   Play internationally if possible. The majority of NBA players who are not selected out of college programs play internationally prior to joining the league. If you attended a D2, D3 university or junior college, this can be a good route into the NBA. International play exposes you to a greater variety of strong players and different basketball styles. If you are an outstanding player but don’t feel like college is for you, it might be helpful to seek out an international basketball league that has fewer age and eligibility requirements than the NBA. [10]   Hoopsagents.com has a big international directory to connect you with an agent in your desired country to get started.           3   Hire an agent. If you are at a high level of play but haven’t been approached by a recruiter yet, it may be that you are past college age or just haven’t gotten the right people to see you play. Contact an agent in the U.S. to help facilitate important meetings to get your professional career on track. [11]   Hoopshype.com has a list of the top basketball agents and links to their sports agencies so you can contact them. You can see how many players each agent has placed and where, if you have your heart set on a specific team.

Stephan Curry points his feet to the right lining up his hip, elbow, and wrist with the basket but Ray Allen points his feet at the basket and with both shoots, they extend their arm as far as they can flicking their wrist with their fingers pointing down. The middle finger is the last one to be pointed down. The arc depends on player.   Thanks!

Get your mind off it and ensure that your body and mind are refreshed by doing things out of the ordinary, not just practice and study, but some self time too. After a day or two of taking time out, go back to practicing and playing but start off easy to begin with. A break often cures both the slump and restores energy.   Thanks!

Improve your game by watching videos of yourself and working one-on-one with a coach. As a college player, play in showcases to connect with NBA recruiters, or play internationally if your school isn’t a hub for scouts.    Did this summary help you? Yes No        Tips    Have a back up plan in case your dreams don't go as planned.  Consider trying a basketball summer camp. You will usually get playing time.  Go talk to scouts, ask your coach for any opportunities and never undermine yourself.  Always try to stand out on the court in the most positive way possible. Have a signature move and master it, and try to make sure as many eyes are on you as possible!  Learn how to be a point guard. It's, likely you will not be an extremely gifted athlete like, Lebron James but if you can dribble, pass, and shoot quickly and cleverly then you'll be fine.  Build up strength by exercising your body and practice a good shooting form, and you'll be able to eventually easily shoot those 3's!       Warnings    Do not get involved with the wrong people or do drugs. Drugs can reduce your ability to perform athletically.  Be realistic about the position you want to play. Compare your height, and build to the average NBA player in that position  Do not take drugs to help you perform better, this is illegal and you will be kicked off the team.

Lets just say you better have a backup plan.  HoopsVibe’s Very Quick Call: Only 3 out of 10,000 high school basketball players go pro.    With the massive popularity of the NBA more kids than ever dream of growing up to play professional basketball. Although kids dreaming big and working hard on their game is great, the statistics on the number of players that actually make it to the pros is daunting. I know no one wants to think they’ll ever get injured or worse yet, that they simply aren’t good enough, but the reality is no matter how much you are dominating the local, state or even national scene the odds are stacked against you.  Here’s a peak inside exactly what the odds are of playing professional basketball. We suggest staying awake in math class just incase your crossover dribble doesn’t prove to be quite as lethal as you thought.   High School Players: 545,844  College Players: 17,500  Draftees: 48 ​   ​​ If we break this down into percentages it is even more impressive.   Players that make the jump from high school to college: 2.9%  Players that make the jump from college to pro: 1.3%  Players that make the jump from high school to pro: .03%   This means out of every 10,000 kids playing basketball in high school only 3 will make it to the pros. Note, this doesn’t mean they’re going to stay in the pros more than 5 seconds. This doesn’t mean they’re going to get a sneaker deal and be in a Pepsi commercial. This simply means they’ll get drafted.  When I was in high school we had 8 teams in our league and maybe 100 hundred or so kids in our division. You better be ripping your league and division apart if you think you’re moving up to the next level. And realistically, that’s probably not enough. Your entire division is still probably only a coupe thousand players. You better be ripping your state apart, but depending on what state you play high school in that is also likely not enough.  The bottom line is even if you are convinced you are the next LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, or Moses Malone (Yes, I’m old-school) you better get that education. Worst case scenario you use all your new found math knowledge to make sure you don’t go bankrupt like Allen Iverson and 80% (or so) of NBA players that file for bankruptcy within 5-years of retirement. Best case scenario you know how to handle your money due to all your math knowledge and build an empire like Michael Jordan or at the very least give yourself an option if you blowout your knee or ACL two months into your career. It can happen to anyone, just ask Derrick Rose and Kobe Bryant who learnt first hand of their basketball mortality last season.  For more info, updaets, and dirty filthy gossip follow @HoopsVibe.

Reuters Eras aren't what they used to be. Anthony Davis, the fabulously talented 6'10'' forward of the Kentucky Wildcats national championship team, an era was just one season. Davis and probably two of his "one-and-done" freshman teammates will be bolting for the NBA. On Draft Day, Thursday, June 28, Davis—by consensus the year's best college basketball player—forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and point guard Marcus Teague will head for the pros, and a new batch of blue-chip studs recruited by Kentucky coach John Calipari for the sole purpose of playing just one year will be poised to take their places. The NBA has a rule that requires players to be 19 years old or have completed one year of college before becoming eligible for the NBA Draft. The rule was instituted in 2007, a delayed reaction to LeBron James having skipped college altogether and gone straight from high school to the pros in 2003, proving that for the truly elite players the transition was not hard. The NCAA, though, and the NBA don't like the idea of players skipping college ball and want to do something about it. Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA and the latest wet blanket to be dropped on college sports by its ruling body, sat on a panel discussion just before the start of the NCAA tournament and said, "I happened to dislike the one-and-done rule enormously and wish it didn't exist. I think it forces young men to go to college who have little or no interest in going to college."  MORE ON SPORTS        The Shame of College Sports          An Agent's Plan for Fixing College Sports          Should College Athletes Get Paid? Ending the Debate, Once and for All          Confessions of a College-Basketball Benchwarmer          How Title IX Hurts Female Athletes          Joe Paterno's Disappointing Last Decade at Penn State    I hate to take a cynical note on this, but I don't think Emmert or anyone else in the NCAA really cares about young men going to college—or at least attending college classes. I think what they care about is whether or not these young men play college basketball, and I think what they would like is to have the NBA's cooperation in doing anything they can to keep boys playing college basketball for as long as they can. The simple reality is that most basketball and football players who wind up in the pros had little or no interest in going to college in the first place. They want to be first in line for the professional drafts that will take them away from the world of amateur sham, very reasonably wanting their talents to produce revenue for themselves and their families instead of university athletic departments. Now, when the boys are in the best position to make that pay for them, colleges pretending to show some concern. "It makes a travesty," said Emmert, "of the whole notion of student as an athlete." One might call that poetic justice since for nearly a century colleges have been making a travesty of the notion of athlete as student. Emmert was a guest on NBC Sports' Costas Tonight Wednesday night, trying to convince Bob Costas and the nation that he is the leader of an organization bent on reforming college sports. So why is Emmert so against the one-and-done rule? "It simply creates the wrong type of environment for us," he said. "If you're coming to us to be a collegiate athlete, we want you to be a collegiate athlete." In his own double-talking way, Emmert was actually expressing the truth, or at least a version of it. What he meant was that if a player—for the sake of argument, let's say his name is Anthony Davis—attends a prestigious basketball school like Kentucky for one year and the moves on to the pros, it's Davis and not college basketball who gets the most benefit. For decades the heart of college basketball's appeal has been the fans' delight in watching a player grow and mature into a great talent over three and, in some cases, even four seasons. With so many players leaving school so soon to go to the pros, the appeal of the game has eroded. Regular-season college basketball TV ratings and attendance have been slipping now for several years. Not coincidentally, the NBA has also suffered from an overall ratings slump and slightly declining attendance over the last few years, suffering from a dearth of well-known superstars who aren't named Kobe or LeBron. Commissioner David Stern has expressed some enthusiasm for having the league owners pass a new rule which would require a two-year minimum wait between high school and the NBA—in other words, future Anthony Davises would be forced to spend at least one more year playing basketball for free before getting a chance to cash in. Why does the NBA care how long players stay in college or whether they are in college at all? For the simple reason that college basketball doesn't depend on the existence of the pros, but the pros could not exist without the colleges. Not only does the NBA pay not a dime in player development, it has always benefitted enormously from the fact that its best players were already household names by the time they were drafted. It costs the NBA nothing to wait another year or two to get the players and works much to their advantage if they're even more famous when they put on an NBA uniform. After all, the boom era of the NBA began in 1978 when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird were drafted, respectively, by the rival LA Lakers and Boston Celtics—after having faced each other in the highest-rated NCAA final up to that time between Michigan State and Indiana State. Note that one never hears about the NCAA and NBA getting together to make pronouncements on this subject; that would seem too much like collusion. One might call their relationship, as Dana Carvey's Church Lady used to say, conveeenient . After all, there's no need for conspiracy when both parties are in agreement.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

If you or one of your friends installed the personality-quiz app “This Is Your Digital Life” prior to 2015, then some of your data illicitly made it to the servers of the voter-profiling company.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page.

Madrigal      Inside Uber’s latest attempt to rebuild its app for drivers, the biggest experiment in the gig economy.   Every day, the world’s 3 million Uber drivers spend 8.5 million hours logged into the ride-hailing company’s app. That’s roughly 1,000 years of Uber driving packed into any given 24 hours.  Because of this tremendous scale, Uber is the most important test case for the gig economy, the new economic arrangement where contract workers are arranged into a cohesive labor force by software. There are many companies that share Uber’s controversial approach to doling out work, but none has amassed 3 million people who use the service to try to make money. Never before has an app’s design been so important to so many people.  The Uber app is the drivers’ workplace, as much as the city where they’re driving is. Each decision about its interface structures drivers’ interactions with Uber the company as well as Uber the transportation marketplace. And Uber is now putting the finishing touches on a from-scratch rebuild of the driver app.    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

Reuters Eras aren't what they used to be. Anthony Davis, the fabulously talented 6'10'' forward of the Kentucky Wildcats national championship team, an era was just one season. Davis and probably two of his "one-and-done" freshman teammates will be bolting for the NBA. On Draft Day, Thursday, June 28, Davis—by consensus the year's best college basketball player—forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and point guard Marcus Teague will head for the pros, and a new batch of blue-chip studs recruited by Kentucky coach John Calipari for the sole purpose of playing just one year will be poised to take their places. The NBA has a rule that requires players to be 19 years old or have completed one year of college before becoming eligible for the NBA Draft. The rule was instituted in 2007, a delayed reaction to LeBron James having skipped college altogether and gone straight from high school to the pros in 2003, proving that for the truly elite players the transition was not hard. The NCAA, though, and the NBA don't like the idea of players skipping college ball and want to do something about it. Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA and the latest wet blanket to be dropped on college sports by its ruling body, sat on a panel discussion just before the start of the NCAA tournament and said, "I happened to dislike the one-and-done rule enormously and wish it didn't exist. I think it forces young men to go to college who have little or no interest in going to college."  MORE ON SPORTS        The Shame of College Sports          An Agent's Plan for Fixing College Sports          Should College Athletes Get Paid? Ending the Debate, Once and for All          Confessions of a College-Basketball Benchwarmer          How Title IX Hurts Female Athletes          Joe Paterno's Disappointing Last Decade at Penn State    I hate to take a cynical note on this, but I don't think Emmert or anyone else in the NCAA really cares about young men going to college—or at least attending college classes. I think what they care about is whether or not these young men play college basketball, and I think what they would like is to have the NBA's cooperation in doing anything they can to keep boys playing college basketball for as long as they can. The simple reality is that most basketball and football players who wind up in the pros had little or no interest in going to college in the first place. They want to be first in line for the professional drafts that will take them away from the world of amateur sham, very reasonably wanting their talents to produce revenue for themselves and their families instead of university athletic departments. Now, when the boys are in the best position to make that pay for them, colleges pretending to show some concern. "It makes a travesty," said Emmert, "of the whole notion of student as an athlete." One might call that poetic justice since for nearly a century colleges have been making a travesty of the notion of athlete as student. Emmert was a guest on NBC Sports' Costas Tonight Wednesday night, trying to convince Bob Costas and the nation that he is the leader of an organization bent on reforming college sports. So why is Emmert so against the one-and-done rule? "It simply creates the wrong type of environment for us," he said. "If you're coming to us to be a collegiate athlete, we want you to be a collegiate athlete." In his own double-talking way, Emmert was actually expressing the truth, or at least a version of it. What he meant was that if a player—for the sake of argument, let's say his name is Anthony Davis—attends a prestigious basketball school like Kentucky for one year and the moves on to the pros, it's Davis and not college basketball who gets the most benefit. For decades the heart of college basketball's appeal has been the fans' delight in watching a player grow and mature into a great talent over three and, in some cases, even four seasons. With so many players leaving school so soon to go to the pros, the appeal of the game has eroded. Regular-season college basketball TV ratings and attendance have been slipping now for several years. Not coincidentally, the NBA has also suffered from an overall ratings slump and slightly declining attendance over the last few years, suffering from a dearth of well-known superstars who aren't named Kobe or LeBron. Commissioner David Stern has expressed some enthusiasm for having the league owners pass a new rule which would require a two-year minimum wait between high school and the NBA—in other words, future Anthony Davises would be forced to spend at least one more year playing basketball for free before getting a chance to cash in. Why does the NBA care how long players stay in college or whether they are in college at all? For the simple reason that college basketball doesn't depend on the existence of the pros, but the pros could not exist without the colleges. Not only does the NBA pay not a dime in player development, it has always benefitted enormously from the fact that its best players were already household names by the time they were drafted. It costs the NBA nothing to wait another year or two to get the players and works much to their advantage if they're even more famous when they put on an NBA uniform. After all, the boom era of the NBA began in 1978 when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird were drafted, respectively, by the rival LA Lakers and Boston Celtics—after having faced each other in the highest-rated NCAA final up to that time between Michigan State and Indiana State. Note that one never hears about the NCAA and NBA getting together to make pronouncements on this subject; that would seem too much like collusion. One might call their relationship, as Dana Carvey's Church Lady used to say, conveeenient . After all, there's no need for conspiracy when both parties are in agreement.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

Robinson Meyer      How to find out if you are one of the 87 million victims   Facebook has begun to notify users who were affected by the Cambridge Analytica data breach. If you or one of your friends installed the personality-quiz app “This Is Your Digital Life” prior to 2015, then some of your data illicitly made it to the servers of the voter-profiling company.  If your data was ensnared in the breach, you’re not alone. I’m also one of Cambridge Analytica’s victims. (If you’re not sure whether you were affected, you can go to this Facebook page , which will tell you if your information was shared.)  I know I was affected by the breach because I saw a big text box when I opened the Facebook app on my phone this morning.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.

In this twelve-year span, Kevin Garnett received $28,000,000, which was the highest salary payment of any NBA player, during the 2003–04 season . Garnett has been the highest-paid NBA player per year in seven of the past twelve NBA seasons. Michael Jordan was the first NBA player to sign a contract worth over thirty million dollars in a season. During the 1997–98 season , Jordan earned $33,140,000, which still stands as the most any NBA player has earned on a 1 year contract, Jordan also holds the record for the second largest 1 year contract at $30,140,000 in the 96-97 season.. Kobe Bryant become just the second player to reach this milestone when the 2013–14 season began. [1]  LeBron James became the third in the 2016–17 season . Stephen Curry became the first player to eclipse $40-Million per year when he signed a record 5-year contract worth $201-Million in 2017, starting with $34,682,550 in the 2017-18 season and ending with the largest earnings in the 2021-22 season with a record payout of $45,780,966.   Beginning in the 1984–85 NBA season , the NBA's first salary cap was introduced. The NBA salary cap is the maximum dollar amount each NBA team can spend on its players for the season. However, the NBA uses a "soft" salary cap, which means that significant "salary exceptions" allow NBA teams to exceed their allotted amount in order to sign players. The salary cap is determined during the offseason , but as stated earlier, it is liable to change. [2]      Michael Jordan , who earned $33,140,000 in the 1997–98 NBA season , attempts a slam dunk at the old Boston Garden .    An exception is necessary to sign a player for a contract that would exceed the salary cap threshold of the "soft cap". The Larry Bird exception , more commonly known as Bird Rights, allows teams to re-sign a current player only if he has played for that particular team for a minimum of three years. [3] Another exception known as the mid-level exception allows for teams that are over the salary cap to sign one or more players as long as they do not exceed the total amount of the average NBA salary. [4] Next, the bi-annual exception can be used by teams every other year to sign a free agent(s) for up to two years at an amount set by the NBA. [5] Finally, the rookie player exception allows any NBA team to sign their first-round draft pick to a contract based upon a scale previously set forth by the NBA. Another option for teams would be to assign players to a league-assigned minimum salary contract for a maximum of two years.  According to 2010–11 NBA season game performance, the league's best players were not its highest-paid players. Each year there are ten players selected to one of the two All-NBA Teams . Out of those ten players chosen that year, Kobe Bryant was the only player that was also among the game's ten highest-paid during the 2010–11 NBA season.

Her work appears on various websites. An avid traveler, swimmer and golf enthusiast, Williams has a Bachelor of Arts in English from Mills College and a Master of Business Administration from St. Mary's College of California.            Basketball players on a court  Photo Credit: Andersen Ross/Blend Images/Getty Images          Statistics provide a snapshot of information, and often apply only to the time period for which the statistics are gathered. However, a snapshot can be useful, especially if your child is proving to be a phenomenal basketball player. While the numbers may vary, the percentage of high school players who make it the NBA is always very small. Keep in mind that a 2006 rule requires that players who participate in the draft are at least one year out of high school and must be at least 19 to play.   Video of the Day             Probability of Being Drafted  Male players are drafted into the National Basketball Association and female players are drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association. According to the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, neither have a very high probability of being drafted. For men, about three out of 10,000 male high school basketball players will be drafted into the NBA, or about .03 percent. For women, the numbers are similar. One out of 5,000 players, or .02 percent, will be drafted into the WNBA.            Longevity in the Sport  If you evaluate this statistic as information for your high school player, keep in mind a few other intriguing statistics. Just 10.6 percent of the 2010-11 rosters include players who have just one year of experience. Players with four or fewer years of experience make up the largest part of the team rosters at 52.1 percent. Only 10.6 percent of players have more than four years of experience, which makes a long-term career in the NBA a long shot for most players.  Plan for the Worst  If your high school player is drafted for the NBA at age 19 or after one or two years of college, he can still get a college education. An October 2009 article in "The New York Times" covered the return of many NBA players to college during the offseason. Many players and coaches consider returning to college a smart move for a player. The rigors of professional sports and chance of basketball-ending injuries make a college or vocational education essential for a good career after the NBA.  Benefits of Team Sports  The good news is that team sports of almost any variety are very healthy for kids, regardless of their professional aspirations. Beyond the physical benefits, which can be significant given the spiraling statistics in childhood obesity levels, youth sports also provide significant social and emotional benefits. Youth players, regardless of gender, have stronger social development skills, moral development and are less likely to engage in gang behavior.                       Lose Weight. Feel Great!

Whether you’re in middle school, high school, or college, setting your sights on the NBA can only improve your game, so don’t be afraid to dream big.         Steps    Part 1   Playing Your Best           1   Practice shooting from everywhere on the court. Practice shooting at close range, longer range and then 3-point range so you become a dexterous, well-rounded shooter. It can help to work on your shooting ability in continuous three-week rotations, spending one week working on each type of shot. You can never be too precise. [1]   Try to maintain a strong shooting average: At least 60% average from the 2-point field goal, 40% from 3-point line and 75% from free throw line. [2]             2   Record video of yourself playing in basketball games. Watching your body move when you make good baskets and when you miss can help you tweak things that are off and improve your game. If you’re in middle or high school, have a friend or parent attend a game to help you record some video footage. If you’re in college, many teams have media assistants who record games for the university. Ask your coach if you can review some game footage.  It can be helpful to compile your best footage from these games into a highlight reel for potential NBA recruiters, if you are in college. Edit the video to keep lagging moments to a minimum and keep your video under 5 minutes. [3]            3   Play with people who are better than you are. You become a stronger and more strategic basketball player when you are challenged by someone whose skills are superior to yours. Elevate your game by regularly scrimmaging other players who push you to be better. If you are in high school and are already the best basketball player you know, try to join a local AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) team to find people whose playing ability really pushes you to a new level. [4]   Top AAU teams are tracked by prominent college recruiters and are one of the top ways to get athletic scholarships. These regional teams attract top players from many high schools, so recruiters like to visit them to see a bigger pool of talented kids. Dwight Howard, Kobe Bryant and Josh Smith, for example, all grew up playing AAU basketball. You can find an AAU club in your area at aausports.org.           4   Amp up the difficulty of your drills. Add some intensity to normal running and practice drills by increasing their difficulty. You could try running in sand or dribbling in gravel. Doing this will make your skills sharper and increase your endurance. You can do this whether you’re in middle school, high school or college.         5   Start a strength-training regimen to build muscle. Increasing your physical strength will enable you to make shots from farther away and muscle around people who guard you. Start a strength-training regimen with a coach who has an understanding of basketball. They can tailor your exercises to your body and your sport’s specific needs. [5]   If you are in high school, contact your school’s athletic director and ask if they can connect you with a lifting coach who has basketball experience.  If you are in college, your school likely already has strength-training experts on staff. Contact your athletic administrator to see if you can book some one-on-one sessions with a personal trainer.           6   Increase your endurance by implementing healthy habits. Basketball requires lots of running up and down the court, so it is imperative to maintain your physical condition so you can play your best from the beginning of the game to the end. Staying well hydrated, getting 8 hours of sleep a night, and eating healthy foods will all help your body function optimally and increase your endurance. [6]                Part 2   Standing Out From the Crowd          1   Find the right coach. If you’re in middle school or high school, your school basketball team likely has a coach already. If you’re not getting much individual attention from that coach though and feel really passionately about improving your basketball game, consider hiring a private coach. A private coach can give you personalized feedback to help you grow more quickly as a player and work on weak areas of your game.  Coachup.com can connect you with a private skilled basketball tutor in your area.  Working with a coach one-on-one enables you to build a more intimate mentor-mentee relationship. When interviewing potential private coaches, look for someone you have good rapport with and whose accomplishments you respect. It is a bonus if they have connections with influential recruiters.           2   Use every skill you have to your advantage. If you have a playing skill that is particularly strong, make it your own. There are lots of great basketball players, but you’ll need to distinguish yourself from the pack as a specialist in one area if you want to be in the NBA.  If you are particularly fast, for example, try to bring speed to every skill you perform on the court. People will notice that this is a unique strength of yours as a player.           3   Be a leader on and off the court. Attitude matters. A basketball team can’t function with a roster full of prima donnas because it is a team sport. Make yourself appealing to prospective recruiters by being a leader and exemplary person both on the off the court. Everyone wants a player who will get along with others and inspire the team to be better. [7]   Learning from your mistakes and setting a high standard are two great ways you can step up your leadership game.  Don’t be afraid to approach your coach at school, whether high school or college, and ask if there’s a way to assume more responsibility on the team.           4   Play as many tournaments as possible. Getting in front of talent scouts from major universities (if you are in high school) and NBA teams (if you are in college) are key to advancing in your basketball career. Attend as many tournaments as possible, as these are places important coaches and influencers go to see and select the next generation of players. The more influential people who see you play the better. [8]   If you’re in high school, many AAU leagues participate in regional tournaments your school may not. You don’t need to sign up for anything extra, but the schedule can be grueling on top of your other commitments. If playing in the NBA is really your dream, try to attend as many as you can.  If you’re in college, your school basketball team already participates in all the right tournaments. Make the most of recruiting opportunities at regional conference tournaments and March Madness by playing the best you possibly can.            Part 3   Positioning Yourself for Professional Play          1   Make your high school team so you can get onto a college team. You must be 19 to play in the NBA, and most players are drafted out of college. Excel to the best of your ability in high school and AAU basketball, so you can play at a competitive basketball school such as Duke, Kentucky, or North Carolina. Top NBA recruiters usually only consider players from Division 1 basketball programs. [9]   A private basketball coach can help step up your game if you’re not where you need to be.  If you’re in high school, good grades will help round you out as a full “package” and make you more attractive as a student-athlete. Think like a recruiter: You want to be an easy sell to whomever they need to make your case to. If you need an academic tutor to bring your grades up, contact your dean’s office. They can connect you with a tutor who will meet your needs.  Most high school and college coaches will have a good sense of which recruiters will be at specific games or showcases. Ask your coach if they have any information about this, if you’re hoping to connect with someone.           2   Play internationally if possible. The majority of NBA players who are not selected out of college programs play internationally prior to joining the league. If you attended a D2, D3 university or junior college, this can be a good route into the NBA. International play exposes you to a greater variety of strong players and different basketball styles. If you are an outstanding player but don’t feel like college is for you, it might be helpful to seek out an international basketball league that has fewer age and eligibility requirements than the NBA. [10]   Hoopsagents.com has a big international directory to connect you with an agent in your desired country to get started.           3   Hire an agent. If you are at a high level of play but haven’t been approached by a recruiter yet, it may be that you are past college age or just haven’t gotten the right people to see you play. Contact an agent in the U.S. to help facilitate important meetings to get your professional career on track. [11]   Hoopshype.com has a list of the top basketball agents and links to their sports agencies so you can contact them. You can see how many players each agent has placed and where, if you have your heart set on a specific team.

Stephan Curry points his feet to the right lining up his hip, elbow, and wrist with the basket but Ray Allen points his feet at the basket and with both shoots, they extend their arm as far as they can flicking their wrist with their fingers pointing down. The middle finger is the last one to be pointed down. The arc depends on player.   Thanks!

Get your mind off it and ensure that your body and mind are refreshed by doing things out of the ordinary, not just practice and study, but some self time too. After a day or two of taking time out, go back to practicing and playing but start off easy to begin with. A break often cures both the slump and restores energy.   Thanks!

Improve your game by watching videos of yourself and working one-on-one with a coach. As a college player, play in showcases to connect with NBA recruiters, or play internationally if your school isn’t a hub for scouts.    Did this summary help you? Yes No        Tips    Have a back up plan in case your dreams don't go as planned.  Consider trying a basketball summer camp. You will usually get playing time.  Go talk to scouts, ask your coach for any opportunities and never undermine yourself.  Always try to stand out on the court in the most positive way possible. Have a signature move and master it, and try to make sure as many eyes are on you as possible!  Learn how to be a point guard. It's, likely you will not be an extremely gifted athlete like, Lebron James but if you can dribble, pass, and shoot quickly and cleverly then you'll be fine.  Build up strength by exercising your body and practice a good shooting form, and you'll be able to eventually easily shoot those 3's!       Warnings    Do not get involved with the wrong people or do drugs. Drugs can reduce your ability to perform athletically.  Be realistic about the position you want to play.

Lets just say you better have a backup plan.  HoopsVibe’s Very Quick Call: Only 3 out of 10,000 high school basketball players go pro.    With the massive popularity of the NBA more kids than ever dream of growing up to play professional basketball. Although kids dreaming big and working hard on their game is great, the statistics on the number of players that actually make it to the pros is daunting. I know no one wants to think they’ll ever get injured or worse yet, that they simply aren’t good enough, but the reality is no matter how much you are dominating the local, state or even national scene the odds are stacked against you.  Here’s a peak inside exactly what the odds are of playing professional basketball. We suggest staying awake in math class just incase your crossover dribble doesn’t prove to be quite as lethal as you thought.   High School Players: 545,844  College Players: 17,500  Draftees: 48 ​   ​​ If we break this down into percentages it is even more impressive.   Players that make the jump from high school to college: 2.9%  Players that make the jump from college to pro: 1.3%  Players that make the jump from high school to pro: .03%   This means out of every 10,000 kids playing basketball in high school only 3 will make it to the pros. Note, this doesn’t mean they’re going to stay in the pros more than 5 seconds. This doesn’t mean they’re going to get a sneaker deal and be in a Pepsi commercial. This simply means they’ll get drafted.  When I was in high school we had 8 teams in our league and maybe 100 hundred or so kids in our division. You better be ripping your league and division apart if you think you’re moving up to the next level. And realistically, that’s probably not enough. Your entire division is still probably only a coupe thousand players. You better be ripping your state apart, but depending on what state you play high school in that is also likely not enough.  The bottom line is even if you are convinced you are the next LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, or Moses Malone (Yes, I’m old-school) you better get that education. Worst case scenario you use all your new found math knowledge to make sure you don’t go bankrupt like Allen Iverson and 80% (or so) of NBA players that file for bankruptcy within 5-years of retirement. Best case scenario you know how to handle your money due to all your math knowledge and build an empire like Michael Jordan or at the very least give yourself an option if you blowout your knee or ACL two months into your career. It can happen to anyone, just ask Derrick Rose and Kobe Bryant who learnt first hand of their basketball mortality last season.  For more info, updaets, and dirty filthy gossip follow @HoopsVibe.

Reuters Eras aren't what they used to be. Anthony Davis, the fabulously talented 6'10'' forward of the Kentucky Wildcats national championship team, an era was just one season. Davis and probably two of his "one-and-done" freshman teammates will be bolting for the NBA. On Draft Day, Thursday, June 28, Davis—by consensus the year's best college basketball player—forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and point guard Marcus Teague will head for the pros, and a new batch of blue-chip studs recruited by Kentucky coach John Calipari for the sole purpose of playing just one year will be poised to take their places. The NBA has a rule that requires players to be 19 years old or have completed one year of college before becoming eligible for the NBA Draft. The rule was instituted in 2007, a delayed reaction to LeBron James having skipped college altogether and gone straight from high school to the pros in 2003, proving that for the truly elite players the transition was not hard. The NCAA, though, and the NBA don't like the idea of players skipping college ball and want to do something about it. Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA and the latest wet blanket to be dropped on college sports by its ruling body, sat on a panel discussion just before the start of the NCAA tournament and said, "I happened to dislike the one-and-done rule enormously and wish it didn't exist. I think it forces young men to go to college who have little or no interest in going to college."  MORE ON SPORTS        The Shame of College Sports          An Agent's Plan for Fixing College Sports          Should College Athletes Get Paid? Ending the Debate, Once and for All          Confessions of a College-Basketball Benchwarmer          How Title IX Hurts Female Athletes          Joe Paterno's Disappointing Last Decade at Penn State    I hate to take a cynical note on this, but I don't think Emmert or anyone else in the NCAA really cares about young men going to college—or at least attending college classes. I think what they care about is whether or not these young men play college basketball, and I think what they would like is to have the NBA's cooperation in doing anything they can to keep boys playing college basketball for as long as they can. The simple reality is that most basketball and football players who wind up in the pros had little or no interest in going to college in the first place. They want to be first in line for the professional drafts that will take them away from the world of amateur sham, very reasonably wanting their talents to produce revenue for themselves and their families instead of university athletic departments. Now, when the boys are in the best position to make that pay for them, colleges pretending to show some concern. "It makes a travesty," said Emmert, "of the whole notion of student as an athlete." One might call that poetic justice since for nearly a century colleges have been making a travesty of the notion of athlete as student. Emmert was a guest on NBC Sports' Costas Tonight Wednesday night, trying to convince Bob Costas and the nation that he is the leader of an organization bent on reforming college sports. So why is Emmert so against the one-and-done rule? "It simply creates the wrong type of environment for us," he said. "If you're coming to us to be a collegiate athlete, we want you to be a collegiate athlete." In his own double-talking way, Emmert was actually expressing the truth, or at least a version of it. What he meant was that if a player—for the sake of argument, let's say his name is Anthony Davis—attends a prestigious basketball school like Kentucky for one year and the moves on to the pros, it's Davis and not college basketball who gets the most benefit. For decades the heart of college basketball's appeal has been the fans' delight in watching a player grow and mature into a great talent over three and, in some cases, even four seasons. With so many players leaving school so soon to go to the pros, the appeal of the game has eroded. Regular-season college basketball TV ratings and attendance have been slipping now for several years. Not coincidentally, the NBA has also suffered from an overall ratings slump and slightly declining attendance over the last few years, suffering from a dearth of well-known superstars who aren't named Kobe or LeBron. Commissioner David Stern has expressed some enthusiasm for having the league owners pass a new rule which would require a two-year minimum wait between high school and the NBA—in other words, future Anthony Davises would be forced to spend at least one more year playing basketball for free before getting a chance to cash in. Why does the NBA care how long players stay in college or whether they are in college at all? For the simple reason that college basketball doesn't depend on the existence of the pros, but the pros could not exist without the colleges. Not only does the NBA pay not a dime in player development, it has always benefitted enormously from the fact that its best players were already household names by the time they were drafted. It costs the NBA nothing to wait another year or two to get the players and works much to their advantage if they're even more famous when they put on an NBA uniform. After all, the boom era of the NBA began in 1978 when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird were drafted, respectively, by the rival LA Lakers and Boston Celtics—after having faced each other in the highest-rated NCAA final up to that time between Michigan State and Indiana State. Note that one never hears about the NCAA and NBA getting together to make pronouncements on this subject; that would seem too much like collusion. One might call their relationship, as Dana Carvey's Church Lady used to say, conveeenient . After all, there's no need for conspiracy when both parties are in agreement.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.   Continue Reading           Alana Semuels / The Atlantic   A House You Can Buy, But Never Own    Alana Semuels      African Americans in the same neighborhoods decimated by subprime lending are now being targeted with new predatory loan offerings, a lawsuit argues.   ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

Robinson Meyer      How to find out if you are one of the 87 million victims   Facebook has begun to notify users who were affected by the Cambridge Analytica data breach. If you or one of your friends installed the personality-quiz app “This Is Your Digital Life” prior to 2015, then some of your data illicitly made it to the servers of the voter-profiling company.  If your data was ensnared in the breach, you’re not alone. I’m also one of Cambridge Analytica’s victims. (If you’re not sure whether you were affected, you can go to this Facebook page , which will tell you if your information was shared.)  I know I was affected by the breach because I saw a big text box when I opened the Facebook app on my phone this morning. Under a bolded headline reading “Protecting Your Information,” the notice read:    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Why the GOP Is Making the Midterm Elections All About Impeachment    David Frum      It may be a counterintuitive gambit, but Republicans are betting it will pay off.   To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.

Madrigal      Inside Uber’s latest attempt to rebuild its app for drivers, the biggest experiment in the gig economy.   Every day, the world’s 3 million Uber drivers spend 8.5 million hours logged into the ride-hailing company’s app. That’s roughly 1,000 years of Uber driving packed into any given 24 hours.  Because of this tremendous scale, Uber is the most important test case for the gig economy, the new economic arrangement where contract workers are arranged into a cohesive labor force by software. There are many companies that share Uber’s controversial approach to doling out work, but none has amassed 3 million people who use the service to try to make money. Never before has an app’s design been so important to so many people.  The Uber app is the drivers’ workplace, as much as the city where they’re driving is. Each decision about its interface structures drivers’ interactions with Uber the company as well as Uber the transportation marketplace. And Uber is now putting the finishing touches on a from-scratch rebuild of the driver app.    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.
