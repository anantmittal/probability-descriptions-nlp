IN THIS ARTICLE     How long does it take to conceive?  How does age affect pregnancy rates?  Can I get pregnant faster?     By Jessica Kelmon   Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: May 2017     No one can say exactly how long it'll take you to get pregnant. But we can tell you how long it typically takes couples to conceive – and how you can try to speed things along.  How long does it take to conceive?  Most couples get pregnant within three months after they start trying. Your own timeline could be longer if you're older , have certain fertility-unfriendly habits (like smoking), or have a condition that impairs fertility .  Of all couples trying to conceive:   30 percent get pregnant within the first cycle (about one month).  60 percent get pregnant within three cycles (about three months).  80 percent get pregnant within six cycles (about six months).  85 percent get pregnant within 12 cycles (about one year).  91 percent get pregnant within 36 cycles (about three years).  93 to 95 percent get pregnant within 48 cycles (about four years).   If you try for a year without success, it's smart to seek help from a fertility specialist . You might conceive on your own if you keep trying, but it's best to find out early if you have an underlying fertility problem so you don't waste valuable time.  If you're 35 or older, get a complete fertility workup even sooner: Make an appointment with a specialist if you're not pregnant within six months.  Getting pregnant: When to have sex Getting pregnant is all about getting the timing right. Find out how to determine when you are most fertile to maximize your chances of pregnancy. See all videos  About 80 to 90 percent of all couples conceive naturally. Ten percent are eventually diagnosed with infertility . (About 93 to 95 percent of couples probably could conceive naturally if they tried long enough. It's just that some get help rather than waiting to find out.)  An "infertility" diagnosis simply means you spent one year of trying to get pregnant without success. (Although you should see a fertility specialist if you're age 35 or older and have been trying to conceive for six months without success, you won't be diagnosed with infertility until a year has passed.)  Once couples diagnosed with infertility get medical help, many do eventually get pregnant. The rest typically end up considering other options, like sperm donation, surrogacy , or adoption .  How does age affect pregnancy rates?  The older you get, the longer it may take you to get pregnant – mainly because your egg quality declines with age. (You were born with all the eggs you'll ever have.) That means fewer of them are able to join with a sperm and grow into a healthy baby. Interestingly, male fertility rates don't start to go down until around age 50.  After one year of trying, about 86 percent of healthy, fertile women in their early 20s will get pregnant. The rate drops to about 63 percent among healthy, fertile women in their early 30s, and 36 percent among healthy, fertile women in their early 40s. By age 45, close to 0 percent of women are able to get pregnant naturally.  Read more about the pros, cons, and likelihood of getting pregnant in your 20s , 30s , and 40s .  Ovulation Calculator Find out when you're likely to ovulate – and boost your chances of conceiving.  Can I get pregnant faster?  Happily, the answer is yes. There are a few steps you can take to speed things along.  First, figure out when you'll ovulate. You can only get pregnant when you ovulate (release an egg from one or your ovaries). There are a few different methods you can try to help pinpoint when you'll ovulate .  Next, time sex with ovulation. Studies show that couples who time sex to coincide with ovulation get pregnant faster. (The best time to have sex is during the two days before ovulation and on the day you ovulate.)  In one study, the pregnancy rates of couples who timed intercourse with ovulation were higher than typically seen among couples trying to conceive:   38 percent were pregnant after one cycle (up from 30 percent).  68 percent were pregnant after three cycles (up from 60 percent).  81 percent were pregnant after six cycles (up from 80 percent).  92 percent were pregnant after 12 cycles (up from 91 percent).

Your general and reproductive health are both important factors in fertility, so schedule a preconception checkup with your provider. Give up smoking , illicit drugs, excessive alcohol consumption , and high amounts of caffeine . Learn which nutrients your body needs for pregnancy and stock up on the right foods. Also, see how being overweight or underweight can hurt your chances of conceiving.  How can I get pregnant quickly? Three things you can do to maximize your chances of getting pregnant quickly.

Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Here, we answer some common conception questions to help increase your chances of getting pregnant. By K. Aleisha Fetters  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Phillip Graybill  Q: Will having an orgasm help me get pregnant? A: Yes! Yes! Yes! Some experts believe that uterine contractions during orgasm may help propel sperm into the cervix, but one thing is for sure -- the tingles (and flood of oxytocin) during orgasm definitely make you relaxed. And that means you've already cleared the biggest baby-making blocker: stress. "The better the sex, the better the chances of conception," says reproductive physiologist Joanna Ellington, Ph.D., in the British documentary The Great Sperm Race . Men who are fully stimulated will ejaculate up to 50 percent more, according to research revealed in the program. "So if you have what I call 'gourmet sex,' where you really spend time and you make it fun for both partners, that is going to make the man more stimulated and he is going to ejaculate more and healthier sperm," she says. Sure, plain old sex, with no female orgasm, can result in a baby, too, but why not go for the gold? Q: Can we determine the sex of our baby? A: Depends on whom you ask. Proponents of the Shettles Method, which was developed in the 1960s, claim a 75- to 90-percent success rate in determining their babies' gender. The Shettles Method is based on the belief that sperm with Y chromosomes (which produce boys) move faster than sperm with X chromosomes (which produce girls) and it is possible that alkaline secretions in the vaginal tract, caused by female orgasm, favor Y chromosomal sperm. Still, there's no "convincing evidence" that sexual techniques can determine gender, according to Optimizing natural fertility . So if your hubby really wants to get out the ol' toy trucks again, opting for in vitro is his best bet, says Melissa M. Goist, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Do Sex Positions Matter? Q: Do certain sex positions help my chances of conceiving? A: Common sense says that deep penetration (through positions like rear-entry and missionary) will dispense sperm closer to the cervix, helping the little swimmers reach their goal, but there's no evidence to back up the theory. Regardless of how you get down to business, sperm are present in the cervical canal just seconds after ejaculation, according to Optimizing natural fertility , a committee opinion by the Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. That means your favorite position is the best one for conceiving, says Shari Brasner, M.D., ob-gyn at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital. "There is no rationale for sex to be uncomfortable or awkward." Q: Can oral sex as foreplay hurt our chances of conceiving? A: Not to be a foreplay killer, but saliva can be a sperm killer. It can interfere with your cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract (making it inhospitable to sperm), and even take out stalwart swimmers, according to Optimizing natural fertility. If clitoral stimulation helps get you in the mood, ask your man to reach for fertility-safe lubricant and put his fingers to work instead. Being face-to-face--and mouth-to-mouth--during the act might even be more intimate. Q: Is hot tub sex a bad idea when trying to conceive? A: Yes. Hot tubs are typically factory programmed at 104?. At that temp (some like it hotter!) it takes only 10 to 20 minutes to raise the temperature of your body, his body, and his testicles to 102? or higher, according to the American Pregnancy Association. And his boys don't like getting any warmer than 96? if they can help it. Not only can sperm cells sizzle in the heat, the production of them can temporarily screech to a halt--decreasing his sperm count for days. Can You Give Sperm an Advantage? Q: Can gravity help sperm work their magic? A: Probably not. Some women think that lying on your back with your hips elevated for 20 minutes after sex will help ensure that every last sperm gets a fighting chance at the prize, but the belief has no scientific foundation, according to Optimizing natural fertility . It can't hurt, though, Dr. Goist says. So why not use the technique as an excuse to get your post-romp cuddle on? Q: Will lubricants help his sperm reach my egg? A: Nope. Your cervical mucus moves sperm along quite swimmingly all on its own. Plus, most lubricants can interfere with cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract, and kill off even the sturdiest of sperm. In fact, water-based lubricants (like Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60 percent to 100 percent within 60 minutes of incubation, according to a study published in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies . If you really need some extra lubrication during sex (a common issue when you're more focused on making babies than making love), sticking with mineral oil, canola oil, or a hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricant such as Pre-Seed are your best bets, Dr. Brasner says. Timing it Right Q: Is there an ideal time of day to have sex to conceive? A: Sure is. It's in the morning. Or, specifically, after your man gets a good night's rest, says Dr. Goist. When he's sleeping, his body regenerates the sperm lost during the day. Although the average sperm cell has a pretty short shelf life--only seven days--even stalwart swimmers can hit their expiration date early if they get too warm from exercise like bike riding, Dr. Goist says. Q: Should we "save" his sperm for when I'm ovulating? A: No! If your man has been stepping up on cold showers to store his swimmers until your ovulation test turns positive, it's time to turn the heat back up. As long as your partner has a normal sperm count, you'll have the best shot of conceiving if you have sex once a day, according to Optimizing natural fertility . Abstaining can increase sperm count (a good thing in that more boys start the trip), but it can also decrease sperm motility (a bad thing if you don't want them to just chase their tails). Moreover, abstinence intervals greater than five days can diminish sperm counts. Don't forget: Most (but certainly not all!) pregnancies occur during the two days before ovulation, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction .

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

We've got the scoop. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Kaysh Shinn  It's a common tale: Your mom's coworker's daughter's best friend took a certain herb and -- poof! -- was pregnant within weeks. But before you open your mind and wallet to any conception folklore, know the risks. "It is critical to understand that 'natural' does not guarantee 'safe,' and that herbs are not tightly regulated in our country," says Melinda Johnson, M.S., R.D., director of Arizona State University's Didactic Program in Dietetics and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. In many cases, the bottle that screams "miracle infertility cure" has never even been tested, let alone backed up scientifically. "I worry a lot about indiscriminate use of 'herbs,'" says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and codirector of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. "If some of these treatments have a medical benefit, we should subject them to drug testing like any of the drugs before the FDA that have randomized safety trials, and show efficacy over placebo." And even if it's okay for your prebaby body, an untested supplement might harm a fetus if you get pregnant more quickly than planned. "One herb, chasteberry, has very minor evidence of helping women get pregnant," Johnson notes. "However, it's also contraindicated for use during pregnancy." Bottom line: Don't use any supplement or herb without the knowledge of your doctor. That said, there are supplements that are proven to help set you up for the best possible pregnancy. Let's start with the one that's not only safe but essential: folic acid. It's a B vitamin that won't necessarily help you get pregnant but is vital to brain development and closure of the baby's neural tube or spinal tube. "That occurs in the first two to three weeks after conception, which is prior to when women will miss their period," says Angela Chaudhari, M.D., a gynecologic surgeon and assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Most Americans don't get enough folic in their diet, so the recommended minimum for women trying to conceive is 400 micrograms (mcg) daily. Most prenatal vitamins have more, and that's not a bad thing -- data suggest that 800 mcg might even be better. Doctors recommend taking a prenatal vitamin just as if you were pregnant because -- fingers crossed! -- you will be soon enough. Consider looking for one that has at least 600 milligrams of calcium and 400 units of vitamin D; many women are deficient in both. It should also have 70 milligrams of vitamin C. A lack of vitamin C has been associated with less frequent ovulation and a greater risk of miscarriage. When choosing a prenatal vitamin, stick with generic brands. "One thing that makes me crazy is companies that sell expensive vitamins targeted to women who desperately want to conceive," says Jani Jensen, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist and assistant professor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "The truth is, fifty-dollar vitamins don't make smarter babies or a better chance of conception." Another supplement that should be on your radar is iron. Deficiencies are common in the U.S., up to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women in the U.S. "Pregnancy commonly makes women anemic, so I recommend to many women [that they] look at levels, especially those who are vegetarian, and consider adding a supplement if it's not covered in their prenatal or multivitamin," says David Ryley, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston, and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. A lesser-known supplement that older moms-to-be in particular should know about is coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) "The biological data is very encouraging on this," Dr. Ryley says. "We think it really improves the quality of eggs as animals get older, and therefore can enhance fertility." CoQ10 is a natural supplement that's part of our bodies, so you can safely take 400 mg per day. Then there are antioxidants. "There have been preliminary findings that DHA may help with brain development and IQ," Dr. Chaudhari says. "From what we can gather it certainly doesn't hurt. We just don't know if it helps." DHA is in every antioxidant supplement, but it's not a must-take if you're strapped for cash. It's a good idea to get your guy going on a vitamin regimen, too. "There's evidence that selenium and zinc may aid in sperm mobility," Johnson says. "It's advisable for the father to take a multivitamin that contains these minerals along with vitamin C, folic acid, and vitamin E, all of which have been linked to helping guys create healthier sperm." Finally, if a friend swears a special cooking spice or grain put a bun in her oven, feel free to indulge -- with a large grain of salt. "Sage, for example, was used as a fertility booster in ancient times, but there is no evidence behind it," Johnson notes. If it's pleasing to your palate and eaten in moderation, it certainly won't hurt. Besides, you were looking for an excuse to indulge in your favorite brown butter sage gnocchi anyway, right? That's what we thought. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Many women have healthy babies after losing a pregnancy. Learn everything about conceiving after miscarriage. By Holly Eagleson and Chaunie Marie Brusie, RN, BSN  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Gpointstudio/Shutterstock  Losing a pregnancy is a common experience, albeit a distressing and often isolating one. More than one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage, typically taking place within the first three months of pregnancy. "Now that we can detect pregnancy earlier, it's likely that more women may know about having had one than their mothers or grandmothers might have in the past," says Alice Domar, PhD, executive director of the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health at Boston IVF, assistant professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School, and author of Conquering Infertility . For women under 35, the chance of having a miscarriage in any given pregnancy is about 15 percent. Rates rise as you age, up to 20-35 percent between ages 35 and 45 and as high as 50 percent for women over 45. But take heart—it's very likely you will come out the other side with the baby you've dreamed of. "If you've had one miscarriage, your chance of having a successful pregnancy isn't any different from anybody else's," says Jani Jensen, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist and assistant professor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "That should be hopeful news for couples." Once you're able to create an embryo, odds are that you'll carry another one to term in the future. Kim Malburg found herself fearful when she and her husband decided to try to conceive after experiencing two back-to-back miscarriages. "It is an emotional roller coaster," said Kim. "I just try not to think too much about it and treat each pregnancy differently." Fortunately, there's no danger in trying to get pregnant after a miscarriage has fully completed. Still, many women are under the impression it's not safe to conceive right away. "There's some old wives' tale about waiting three cycles after a miscarriage to get pregnant again," says Angela Chaudhari, MD, a gynecologic surgeon and assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois. "There was also some old data that perhaps people are more likely to miscarry again if they try immediately after, but that's all been debunked." So how soon after a miscarriage can you get pregnant ? Whether you've had a miscarriage or a procedure such as dilation and curettage (D&C), you should see your OB/Gyn for a follow-up appointment about two weeks afterward to make sure everything looks fine physically. "If that's the case, I tell my patients to go ahead and have intercourse," says Chaudhari. "The only thing that would prevent that is a traumatic procedure which might require longer healing." For instance, with a D&C, you may need a course of drugs to help control bleeding. The trick to conceiving after miscarriage is no different than it was initially. "You need to try to time intercourse as close to ovulation as possible and have sex every other day in the days leading up to it as well," says Chaudhari. Of course, getting the green light physically doesn't mean you're actually up for it mentally. "You don't want to get pregnant simply to replace that pregnancy," explains Domar. "Start trying when you feel truly ready for the outcome, whether it's not getting pregnant, getting pregnant and having another loss, or getting pregnant and having a baby." Pregnancy After Miscarriage Moving forward may take more—or less—time than you think. "After a miscarriage, women experience a range of emotions ," says Andrea Braverman, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist in the Department of OB/Gyn at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. "What's right for one person is not for another, so don't force yourself to feel a certain way if you want to move on earlier or grieve longer than you perceive you should." For some women, a public recognition of the lost pregnancy, such as having a burial, planting a tree, or setting up an altar in the home, is healing. "Other women find it therapeutic to journal or write letters to the wished-for baby so they can privately honor the soul," says Beth Jaeger-Skigen, LCSW, a psychotherapist in private practice in San Francisco, California specializing in infertility. You might be tempted to ruminate on how aspects of your lifestyle in the past, like those crazy party days of college, might be connected to the miscarriage. Experts say that's counterproductive, as the cause of most pregnancies losses is unknown . "Instead, focus on what you can do now and address all known risk factors for miscarriage," says Jaeger-Skigen. Stopping smoking and all drug use is critical; giving up alcohol is probably a good idea as well. It's wise to cut caffeine intake to less than 20 milligrams a day (roughly 2 cups of coffee), though eliminating it completely is best. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and veggies is important, as is staying within a healthy body weight—your physician can help you figure out your target range. You should also review environmental factors that could be problematic, such as excessive exposure to toxins, radiation, and X-rays. RELATED:  Tips for Conceiving After a Miscarriage It seems obvious, but you'll also want to limit contact sports and any activities that might risk injury, particularly to your abdomen and back. Once it's safe to start exercising again, you may find that yoga is a gentle option for easing back into physical activity. Also, consider acupuncture as a form of stress relief. "Overall the data on acupuncture is that there may be some benefit and very little downside in doing it," says Jensen. "As long as it's not cost prohibitive, there may be some benefit particular in stress reduction." If you've had two or more miscarriages in a row, see your doctor for a more extensive evaluation to look for potential causes , such as an untreated infection, hormonal issue, or a reproductive abnormality. There could be an underlying genetic or even a structural issue, like a septum wall in your uterus, causing problems. Many women swear by the benefits of progesterone therapy to ward off repeat miscarriages. "It's not routine for first-time pregnancies," explains Dr. Elizabeth Nowacki, an OB/GYN at St. Vincent Fishers Hospital in Indiana. "But for someone with a previous loss or someone who has had trouble getting pregnant...absolutely start that progesterone conversation." Be prepared, though, if no clear answers come to light from tests and your doctor. And stay optimistic: According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, less than 5 percent of women experience two consecutive miscarriages and an even lower percentage—just 1 percent—experience more than two recurrent losses. "It's frustrating, but it's no reason to stop trying to get pregnant, as plenty of women who had unexplained miscarriages have delivered healthy babies," says Dr. Jensen.

Doctors explain how likely that really is for the average person. Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Getty Images If you spend years actively avoiding pregnancy , it can be a surprise to get pregnant pretty quickly, much less the first time you try. That's exactly what happened to NCIS: New Orleans star Zoe McLellan. “For me, it was a bit too easy,” the 41-year-old actor said in an episode of People 's video series " Mom Talk ." McLellan said she told her then-boyfriend that she was looking to become a mom, and it happened right away. “We got pregnant the first time we had sex,” she says. “Pretty fast and furious.” We’ve all heard these stories of women who become pregnant as soon as they decide they want to be, but how common is that, really? Not very, but a fair amount of women get pregnant fairly quickly, Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. This is what she tells her wannabe-pregnant patients (assuming they have unprotected sex twice a week): “50 percent will be pregnant within three months, 75 percent will be pregnant in six months, 90 percent will be pregnant in one year, and 95 percent will be pregnant in two years.” There are a few indicators that getting pregnant may be easier for you than for other women, Lauren Streicher, M.D., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, tells SELF. They include having regular periods (not just every month, but consistently the same number of days in each cycle), and having PMS symptoms like sore breasts and cramps before your period. These are all signs that your cycle is on track. Of course, it’s not always super-easy for many women to get pregnant, even if they time it correctly. “When you ovulate, the egg is only good for 24 hours each,” Whelihan says. “Even if you have [unprotected] sex on the right day of the month, there’s still only a 20 percent chance of conceiving [from that session].” Since sperm can live in your uterus for a few days, she recommends “getting some in there in advance” of ovulating. Ease of conceiving also depends on a woman’s age, says Streicher: “There’s a very big difference between what is expected for a 25-year-old and a 40-year-old." Streicher tells her older patients who say they want to start trying that they should begin tracking their ovulation . If they’re not ovulating regularly or haven’t gotten pregnant within four months, they should see their doctor. And in general, “If [a woman over 35] has been trying for four months, it’s an appropriate time to look at things,” she says. On the other hand, if you're under 35, doctors typically recommend that you wait until you’ve been trying for a year before seeing them to talk about possible next steps. It’s important to remember that it’s not necessarily about you. “When patients aren’t conceiving, 40 percent of the reasons are due to male factors, like low sperm count and bad swimmers,” Whelihan says. No matter what, if you don’t get pregnant right away, try to worry as little as possible—even though that can be incredibly tough—and manage your stress in a healthy way. "The time it takes a person to get pregnant varies significantly from woman to woman," women's health expert Jennifer Wider , M.D., tells SELF. "Unfortunately, it isn't something we can control, so stressing over it usually doesn't help." If you’re ready to get pregnant, like, yesterday, it’s natural that you wouldn’t want to wait a whole year to see what's going on, and experts get that. There's no rule that says you absolutely have to wait before calling up your doctor. “I tell women they have to be very proactive,” Streicher says. As soon as you talk your concerns over with a medical professional, you'll be one step closer to actually getting pregnant.

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

For a healthy, fertile couple where both partners are under the age of 35, the chance of getting pregnant straight away is actually pretty low – it’s estimated at around 25 percent per month, if you have regular unprotected sex around the time of ovulation .  If you’re not actively trying to conceive and not planning intercourse to occur around the time of conception , but you are having regular unprotected sex, your chances of getting pregnant drop to just 11 percent per month.  That’s why doctors have traditionally suggested waiting until you have been trying for a baby for a year before starting fertility investigations , although many couples choose to start preliminary investigations after six months, particularly if they are over thirty.  How do the chances of getting pregnant change as I get older?  On average, a woman with no fertility issues will fall pregnant after four months of trying to get pregnant – but from around the age of 21, fertility slowly declines with age until around 35, then declines faster until the age of 40, after which fertility decline is very rapid.  There is much debate between scientists about the odds of conception.  Here is one of the most commonly cited estimates on the percentage chance of conception after one year of trying:   Age 20: 90% probability  Age 30: 70% probability  Age 35: 55% probability  Age 40: 45% probability  Age 45: 6% probability   A 2002 study by Dunson et al studied 782 healthy couples in Italy and the USA and found that there was great variability in the chances of getting pregnant on the peak day of conception (two days before ovulation). They estimated that, for a couple who were the same age, the odds of falling pregnant in any one menstrual cycle when having sex on the peak day for conception were:   Aged 19 to 26: 50% chance in any one menstrual cycle  Aged 27 to 34: 40% chance in any one menstrual cycle  Aged 35 to 39: less than 30% chance in any one menstrual cycle, but with a male partner five years older, the chance falls to less than 20% chance in any one menstrual cycle   This research suggested that smoking, sexually transmitted disease history and occupational exposures contributed to lower fertility rates.  Can IVF improve fertility rates for older women?  Increased use of assisted conception treatments by older couples has helped promote the idea that fertility treatments like IVF can postpone the natural decline of fertility.  However, success rates for IVF still mirror those of natural fertility, with reports issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) show that the rate of live births from IVF and similar treatments using the mother’s eggs decreases with age.  The latest figures show that for women under 35, the percentage of live births after one cycle of assisted reproductive treatments (including IVF ) was about 45%.  Success rates declined after this age group. For those between ages 35-37 it was about 37%, dropping steadily to just 6.6% for those aged over 42.  But older women can dramatically raise their IVF success rates by using an egg donor; the CDC report states that the chance of a fertilised egg implanting depends on the age of the woman who produced the egg.  Success rates for women, even in their mid-forties, who use a donor egg from a woman in her 20s or early 30s remains above 40%.  Many women have no trouble falling pregnant over 35 or even over forty; but if you’re over 35 and haven’t fallen pregnant after six months, it’s worth talking to your doctor and starting fertility investigations.  What can be done to improve my odds?  Plenty of products, consultants and websites promise to improve your chances of getting pregnant – for a price. But many are rip-offs with no scientific evidence, which prey on the vulnerability of people keen to have a baby.  Here’s some tips on improving your chances of getting pregnant , without paying a fortune:  Reduce your stress levels  There’s a strong correlation between stress levels and fertility. If the main reason you’re stressed is that you want to have a baby, then this is hollow-sounding advice indeed.But there are often ways you can change other stresses in your life; take a holiday; re-think your job or other commitments that might shift down your priority list.  Aim for a healthy weight  Research shows that there is a strong connection between obesity in women and lower fertility. Being significantly underweight for long periods of time can also negatively impact your fertility. Try for a healthy balance!  Improve your diet  While research evidence is inconclusive, some fertility experts swear by a diet of organic foods. It’s your choice whether to go all-out or just keep an eye on your food choices (eating at home and avoiding takeaway is a good start!)  Quit smoking and cut back on the booze  There’s a strong link between smoking and reduced fertility in both men and women; this might be enough of an incentive to help you kick the habit.  Regular exercise  You don’t have to become a gym junkie – in fact, it’s better if you’re not – but some regular exercise each day can’t hurt; and if a nice long walk reduces your stress levels and improves your cardio status, it might well help your chances of getting pregnant.

IN THIS ARTICLE     How long does it take to conceive?  How does age affect pregnancy rates?  Can I get pregnant faster?     By Jessica Kelmon   Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: May 2017     No one can say exactly how long it'll take you to get pregnant. But we can tell you how long it typically takes couples to conceive – and how you can try to speed things along.  How long does it take to conceive?  Most couples get pregnant within three months after they start trying. Your own timeline could be longer if you're older , have certain fertility-unfriendly habits (like smoking), or have a condition that impairs fertility .  Of all couples trying to conceive:   30 percent get pregnant within the first cycle (about one month).  60 percent get pregnant within three cycles (about three months).  80 percent get pregnant within six cycles (about six months).  85 percent get pregnant within 12 cycles (about one year).  91 percent get pregnant within 36 cycles (about three years).  93 to 95 percent get pregnant within 48 cycles (about four years).   If you try for a year without success, it's smart to seek help from a fertility specialist . You might conceive on your own if you keep trying, but it's best to find out early if you have an underlying fertility problem so you don't waste valuable time.  If you're 35 or older, get a complete fertility workup even sooner: Make an appointment with a specialist if you're not pregnant within six months.  Getting pregnant: When to have sex Getting pregnant is all about getting the timing right. Find out how to determine when you are most fertile to maximize your chances of pregnancy. See all videos  About 80 to 90 percent of all couples conceive naturally. Ten percent are eventually diagnosed with infertility . (About 93 to 95 percent of couples probably could conceive naturally if they tried long enough. It's just that some get help rather than waiting to find out.)  An "infertility" diagnosis simply means you spent one year of trying to get pregnant without success. (Although you should see a fertility specialist if you're age 35 or older and have been trying to conceive for six months without success, you won't be diagnosed with infertility until a year has passed.)  Once couples diagnosed with infertility get medical help, many do eventually get pregnant. The rest typically end up considering other options, like sperm donation, surrogacy , or adoption .  How does age affect pregnancy rates?  The older you get, the longer it may take you to get pregnant – mainly because your egg quality declines with age. (You were born with all the eggs you'll ever have.) That means fewer of them are able to join with a sperm and grow into a healthy baby. Interestingly, male fertility rates don't start to go down until around age 50.  After one year of trying, about 86 percent of healthy, fertile women in their early 20s will get pregnant. The rate drops to about 63 percent among healthy, fertile women in their early 30s, and 36 percent among healthy, fertile women in their early 40s. By age 45, close to 0 percent of women are able to get pregnant naturally.  Read more about the pros, cons, and likelihood of getting pregnant in your 20s , 30s , and 40s .  Ovulation Calculator Find out when you're likely to ovulate – and boost your chances of conceiving.  Can I get pregnant faster?  Happily, the answer is yes. There are a few steps you can take to speed things along.  First, figure out when you'll ovulate. You can only get pregnant when you ovulate (release an egg from one or your ovaries). There are a few different methods you can try to help pinpoint when you'll ovulate .  Next, time sex with ovulation. Studies show that couples who time sex to coincide with ovulation get pregnant faster. (The best time to have sex is during the two days before ovulation and on the day you ovulate.)  In one study, the pregnancy rates of couples who timed intercourse with ovulation were higher than typically seen among couples trying to conceive:   38 percent were pregnant after one cycle (up from 30 percent).  68 percent were pregnant after three cycles (up from 60 percent).  81 percent were pregnant after six cycles (up from 80 percent).  92 percent were pregnant after 12 cycles (up from 91 percent).

Your general and reproductive health are both important factors in fertility, so schedule a preconception checkup with your provider. Give up smoking , illicit drugs, excessive alcohol consumption , and high amounts of caffeine . Learn which nutrients your body needs for pregnancy and stock up on the right foods. Also, see how being overweight or underweight can hurt your chances of conceiving.  How can I get pregnant quickly? Three things you can do to maximize your chances of getting pregnant quickly.

Ultrasound picture of PCOS Polycystic ovary at "PCO" Bowel at "B"     What is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?   PCOS, short for polycystic ovarian syndrome, is a common cause of anovulation and female infertility  It is also sometimes referred to as PCO (polycystic ovaries) or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease).   Women with polycystic ovaries and fertility problems:   Do not release an egg (ovulate) regularly  Have ovaries that contain many small cystic structures, about 2-9 mm in diameter      How does normal ovulation work?  In a normal menstrual cycle with ovulation, a mature follicle - which is also a cystic structure - develops. The size of a mature follicle that is ready to ovulate is about 18 to 28mm in diameter.    About 14 days after ovulation the woman would be expected to get a period if she is not pregnant  The basic difference between polycystic and normal ovaries is that although the polycystic ovaries contain many small antral follicles with eggs in them, the follicles do not develop and mature properly - so there is no ovulation.  Since women with polycystic ovaries do not ovulate regularly, they do not get regular menstrual periods       Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome  A common scenario in women with polycystic ovaries is:    Irregular menstrual cycles, called oligomenorrhea, and sometimes a total lack of periods, referred to by doctors as amenorrhea  Onset of excess facial and body hair growth - hirsutism , in the teens or early 20s  Gradually worsening of the excess hair growth over the years   Women with polycystic ovaries often have an excess amount of the male hormones testosterone and androstenedione - resulting in high testosterone levels in the blood. Women with PCO and high testosterone can have increased facial and body hair growth - called hirsutism.     What are the chances of having PCOS?  It is estimated that polycystic ovarian syndrome affects about 8-10% of women of reproductive age. It is very common.     What is the infertility rate with PCOS?  The infertility rate with polycystic ovaries is very high. these women  usually will have difficulty getting pregnant - and usually require treatment to improve chances for pregnancy.  Some  women with polycystic ovary syndrome will ovulate (release a mature egg) occasionally - others do not ever ovulate. In order to conceive, sperm must find and fertilize a mature egg - so we need to ovulate.     Can I conceive with PCOS?  The good news is that the chance of getting pregnant with polycystic ovarian syndrome using fertility treatments is very good. The great majority of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome will be able to have a baby with fertility treatment.  For young women under age 35 with polycystic ovaries, the real question is more about which treatment will be effective - and not so much whether any treatment can ever work.  As far as the chances for pregnancy with PCOS -  pregnancy statistics are difficult to give without knowing the details of the individual case.     Treatments for polycystic ovaries and infertility  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually need induction of ovulation to get pregnant.   Information about options: PCOS Fertility Treatment Options and Success Rates      PCOS fertility treatment options include:    Clomid for PCOS   Femara (Letrozole) for PCOS   Metformin for PCOS   Injectable Gonadotropins for PCOS   IVF - In Vitro Fertilization for PCOS       Diagnosing PCO  How do doctors diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome?     Diagnosing PCO with ultrasound - What does a polycystic ovary look like?  In a polycystic ovary, the numerous small cystic structures, also called antral follicles , give the ovaries a characteristic "polycystic" (many cysts) appearance on ultrasound.

I want to thank Dr. Catenacci and all of the nurses that helped us. Especially Ashley in the Crystal Lake office. You made this process easier by being supportive and positive. Thank you very much!     Dr. Sherban and his staff are the most amazing, compassionate, and supportive people.

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Here, we answer some common conception questions to help increase your chances of getting pregnant. By K. Aleisha Fetters  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Phillip Graybill  Q: Will having an orgasm help me get pregnant? A: Yes! Yes! Yes! Some experts believe that uterine contractions during orgasm may help propel sperm into the cervix, but one thing is for sure -- the tingles (and flood of oxytocin) during orgasm definitely make you relaxed. And that means you've already cleared the biggest baby-making blocker: stress. "The better the sex, the better the chances of conception," says reproductive physiologist Joanna Ellington, Ph.D., in the British documentary The Great Sperm Race . Men who are fully stimulated will ejaculate up to 50 percent more, according to research revealed in the program. "So if you have what I call 'gourmet sex,' where you really spend time and you make it fun for both partners, that is going to make the man more stimulated and he is going to ejaculate more and healthier sperm," she says. Sure, plain old sex, with no female orgasm, can result in a baby, too, but why not go for the gold? Q: Can we determine the sex of our baby? A: Depends on whom you ask. Proponents of the Shettles Method, which was developed in the 1960s, claim a 75- to 90-percent success rate in determining their babies' gender. The Shettles Method is based on the belief that sperm with Y chromosomes (which produce boys) move faster than sperm with X chromosomes (which produce girls) and it is possible that alkaline secretions in the vaginal tract, caused by female orgasm, favor Y chromosomal sperm. Still, there's no "convincing evidence" that sexual techniques can determine gender, according to Optimizing natural fertility . So if your hubby really wants to get out the ol' toy trucks again, opting for in vitro is his best bet, says Melissa M. Goist, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Do Sex Positions Matter? Q: Do certain sex positions help my chances of conceiving? A: Common sense says that deep penetration (through positions like rear-entry and missionary) will dispense sperm closer to the cervix, helping the little swimmers reach their goal, but there's no evidence to back up the theory. Regardless of how you get down to business, sperm are present in the cervical canal just seconds after ejaculation, according to Optimizing natural fertility , a committee opinion by the Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. That means your favorite position is the best one for conceiving, says Shari Brasner, M.D., ob-gyn at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital. "There is no rationale for sex to be uncomfortable or awkward." Q: Can oral sex as foreplay hurt our chances of conceiving? A: Not to be a foreplay killer, but saliva can be a sperm killer. It can interfere with your cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract (making it inhospitable to sperm), and even take out stalwart swimmers, according to Optimizing natural fertility. If clitoral stimulation helps get you in the mood, ask your man to reach for fertility-safe lubricant and put his fingers to work instead. Being face-to-face--and mouth-to-mouth--during the act might even be more intimate. Q: Is hot tub sex a bad idea when trying to conceive? A: Yes. Hot tubs are typically factory programmed at 104?. At that temp (some like it hotter!) it takes only 10 to 20 minutes to raise the temperature of your body, his body, and his testicles to 102? or higher, according to the American Pregnancy Association. And his boys don't like getting any warmer than 96? if they can help it. Not only can sperm cells sizzle in the heat, the production of them can temporarily screech to a halt--decreasing his sperm count for days. Can You Give Sperm an Advantage? Q: Can gravity help sperm work their magic? A: Probably not. Some women think that lying on your back with your hips elevated for 20 minutes after sex will help ensure that every last sperm gets a fighting chance at the prize, but the belief has no scientific foundation, according to Optimizing natural fertility . It can't hurt, though, Dr. Goist says. So why not use the technique as an excuse to get your post-romp cuddle on? Q: Will lubricants help his sperm reach my egg? A: Nope. Your cervical mucus moves sperm along quite swimmingly all on its own. Plus, most lubricants can interfere with cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract, and kill off even the sturdiest of sperm. In fact, water-based lubricants (like Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60 percent to 100 percent within 60 minutes of incubation, according to a study published in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies . If you really need some extra lubrication during sex (a common issue when you're more focused on making babies than making love), sticking with mineral oil, canola oil, or a hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricant such as Pre-Seed are your best bets, Dr. Brasner says. Timing it Right Q: Is there an ideal time of day to have sex to conceive? A: Sure is. It's in the morning. Or, specifically, after your man gets a good night's rest, says Dr. Goist. When he's sleeping, his body regenerates the sperm lost during the day. Although the average sperm cell has a pretty short shelf life--only seven days--even stalwart swimmers can hit their expiration date early if they get too warm from exercise like bike riding, Dr. Goist says. Q: Should we "save" his sperm for when I'm ovulating? A: No! If your man has been stepping up on cold showers to store his swimmers until your ovulation test turns positive, it's time to turn the heat back up. As long as your partner has a normal sperm count, you'll have the best shot of conceiving if you have sex once a day, according to Optimizing natural fertility . Abstaining can increase sperm count (a good thing in that more boys start the trip), but it can also decrease sperm motility (a bad thing if you don't want them to just chase their tails). Moreover, abstinence intervals greater than five days can diminish sperm counts. Don't forget: Most (but certainly not all!) pregnancies occur during the two days before ovulation, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction .

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

We've got the scoop. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Kaysh Shinn  It's a common tale: Your mom's coworker's daughter's best friend took a certain herb and -- poof! -- was pregnant within weeks. But before you open your mind and wallet to any conception folklore, know the risks. "It is critical to understand that 'natural' does not guarantee 'safe,' and that herbs are not tightly regulated in our country," says Melinda Johnson, M.S., R.D., director of Arizona State University's Didactic Program in Dietetics and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. In many cases, the bottle that screams "miracle infertility cure" has never even been tested, let alone backed up scientifically. "I worry a lot about indiscriminate use of 'herbs,'" says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and codirector of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. "If some of these treatments have a medical benefit, we should subject them to drug testing like any of the drugs before the FDA that have randomized safety trials, and show efficacy over placebo." And even if it's okay for your prebaby body, an untested supplement might harm a fetus if you get pregnant more quickly than planned. "One herb, chasteberry, has very minor evidence of helping women get pregnant," Johnson notes. "However, it's also contraindicated for use during pregnancy." Bottom line: Don't use any supplement or herb without the knowledge of your doctor. That said, there are supplements that are proven to help set you up for the best possible pregnancy. Let's start with the one that's not only safe but essential: folic acid. It's a B vitamin that won't necessarily help you get pregnant but is vital to brain development and closure of the baby's neural tube or spinal tube. "That occurs in the first two to three weeks after conception, which is prior to when women will miss their period," says Angela Chaudhari, M.D., a gynecologic surgeon and assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Most Americans don't get enough folic in their diet, so the recommended minimum for women trying to conceive is 400 micrograms (mcg) daily. Most prenatal vitamins have more, and that's not a bad thing -- data suggest that 800 mcg might even be better. Doctors recommend taking a prenatal vitamin just as if you were pregnant because -- fingers crossed! -- you will be soon enough. Consider looking for one that has at least 600 milligrams of calcium and 400 units of vitamin D; many women are deficient in both. It should also have 70 milligrams of vitamin C. A lack of vitamin C has been associated with less frequent ovulation and a greater risk of miscarriage. When choosing a prenatal vitamin, stick with generic brands. "One thing that makes me crazy is companies that sell expensive vitamins targeted to women who desperately want to conceive," says Jani Jensen, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist and assistant professor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "The truth is, fifty-dollar vitamins don't make smarter babies or a better chance of conception." Another supplement that should be on your radar is iron. Deficiencies are common in the U.S., up to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women in the U.S. "Pregnancy commonly makes women anemic, so I recommend to many women [that they] look at levels, especially those who are vegetarian, and consider adding a supplement if it's not covered in their prenatal or multivitamin," says David Ryley, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston, and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. A lesser-known supplement that older moms-to-be in particular should know about is coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) "The biological data is very encouraging on this," Dr. Ryley says. "We think it really improves the quality of eggs as animals get older, and therefore can enhance fertility." CoQ10 is a natural supplement that's part of our bodies, so you can safely take 400 mg per day. Then there are antioxidants. "There have been preliminary findings that DHA may help with brain development and IQ," Dr. Chaudhari says. "From what we can gather it certainly doesn't hurt. We just don't know if it helps." DHA is in every antioxidant supplement, but it's not a must-take if you're strapped for cash. It's a good idea to get your guy going on a vitamin regimen, too. "There's evidence that selenium and zinc may aid in sperm mobility," Johnson says. "It's advisable for the father to take a multivitamin that contains these minerals along with vitamin C, folic acid, and vitamin E, all of which have been linked to helping guys create healthier sperm." Finally, if a friend swears a special cooking spice or grain put a bun in her oven, feel free to indulge -- with a large grain of salt. "Sage, for example, was used as a fertility booster in ancient times, but there is no evidence behind it," Johnson notes. If it's pleasing to your palate and eaten in moderation, it certainly won't hurt. Besides, you were looking for an excuse to indulge in your favorite brown butter sage gnocchi anyway, right? That's what we thought. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Many women have healthy babies after losing a pregnancy. Learn everything about conceiving after miscarriage. By Holly Eagleson and Chaunie Marie Brusie, RN, BSN  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Gpointstudio/Shutterstock  Losing a pregnancy is a common experience, albeit a distressing and often isolating one. More than one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage, typically taking place within the first three months of pregnancy. "Now that we can detect pregnancy earlier, it's likely that more women may know about having had one than their mothers or grandmothers might have in the past," says Alice Domar, PhD, executive director of the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health at Boston IVF, assistant professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School, and author of Conquering Infertility . For women under 35, the chance of having a miscarriage in any given pregnancy is about 15 percent. Rates rise as you age, up to 20-35 percent between ages 35 and 45 and as high as 50 percent for women over 45. But take heart—it's very likely you will come out the other side with the baby you've dreamed of. "If you've had one miscarriage, your chance of having a successful pregnancy isn't any different from anybody else's," says Jani Jensen, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist and assistant professor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "That should be hopeful news for couples." Once you're able to create an embryo, odds are that you'll carry another one to term in the future. Kim Malburg found herself fearful when she and her husband decided to try to conceive after experiencing two back-to-back miscarriages. "It is an emotional roller coaster," said Kim. "I just try not to think too much about it and treat each pregnancy differently." Fortunately, there's no danger in trying to get pregnant after a miscarriage has fully completed. Still, many women are under the impression it's not safe to conceive right away. "There's some old wives' tale about waiting three cycles after a miscarriage to get pregnant again," says Angela Chaudhari, MD, a gynecologic surgeon and assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois. "There was also some old data that perhaps people are more likely to miscarry again if they try immediately after, but that's all been debunked." So how soon after a miscarriage can you get pregnant ? Whether you've had a miscarriage or a procedure such as dilation and curettage (D&C), you should see your OB/Gyn for a follow-up appointment about two weeks afterward to make sure everything looks fine physically. "If that's the case, I tell my patients to go ahead and have intercourse," says Chaudhari. "The only thing that would prevent that is a traumatic procedure which might require longer healing." For instance, with a D&C, you may need a course of drugs to help control bleeding. The trick to conceiving after miscarriage is no different than it was initially. "You need to try to time intercourse as close to ovulation as possible and have sex every other day in the days leading up to it as well," says Chaudhari. Of course, getting the green light physically doesn't mean you're actually up for it mentally. "You don't want to get pregnant simply to replace that pregnancy," explains Domar. "Start trying when you feel truly ready for the outcome, whether it's not getting pregnant, getting pregnant and having another loss, or getting pregnant and having a baby." Pregnancy After Miscarriage Moving forward may take more—or less—time than you think. "After a miscarriage, women experience a range of emotions ," says Andrea Braverman, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist in the Department of OB/Gyn at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. "What's right for one person is not for another, so don't force yourself to feel a certain way if you want to move on earlier or grieve longer than you perceive you should." For some women, a public recognition of the lost pregnancy, such as having a burial, planting a tree, or setting up an altar in the home, is healing. "Other women find it therapeutic to journal or write letters to the wished-for baby so they can privately honor the soul," says Beth Jaeger-Skigen, LCSW, a psychotherapist in private practice in San Francisco, California specializing in infertility. You might be tempted to ruminate on how aspects of your lifestyle in the past, like those crazy party days of college, might be connected to the miscarriage. Experts say that's counterproductive, as the cause of most pregnancies losses is unknown . "Instead, focus on what you can do now and address all known risk factors for miscarriage," says Jaeger-Skigen. Stopping smoking and all drug use is critical; giving up alcohol is probably a good idea as well. It's wise to cut caffeine intake to less than 20 milligrams a day (roughly 2 cups of coffee), though eliminating it completely is best. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and veggies is important, as is staying within a healthy body weight—your physician can help you figure out your target range. You should also review environmental factors that could be problematic, such as excessive exposure to toxins, radiation, and X-rays. RELATED:  Tips for Conceiving After a Miscarriage It seems obvious, but you'll also want to limit contact sports and any activities that might risk injury, particularly to your abdomen and back. Once it's safe to start exercising again, you may find that yoga is a gentle option for easing back into physical activity. Also, consider acupuncture as a form of stress relief. "Overall the data on acupuncture is that there may be some benefit and very little downside in doing it," says Jensen. "As long as it's not cost prohibitive, there may be some benefit particular in stress reduction." If you've had two or more miscarriages in a row, see your doctor for a more extensive evaluation to look for potential causes , such as an untreated infection, hormonal issue, or a reproductive abnormality. There could be an underlying genetic or even a structural issue, like a septum wall in your uterus, causing problems. Many women swear by the benefits of progesterone therapy to ward off repeat miscarriages. "It's not routine for first-time pregnancies," explains Dr. Elizabeth Nowacki, an OB/GYN at St. Vincent Fishers Hospital in Indiana. "But for someone with a previous loss or someone who has had trouble getting pregnant...absolutely start that progesterone conversation." Be prepared, though, if no clear answers come to light from tests and your doctor. And stay optimistic: According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, less than 5 percent of women experience two consecutive miscarriages and an even lower percentage—just 1 percent—experience more than two recurrent losses. "It's frustrating, but it's no reason to stop trying to get pregnant, as plenty of women who had unexplained miscarriages have delivered healthy babies," says Dr. Jensen.

Doctors explain how likely that really is for the average person. Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Getty Images If you spend years actively avoiding pregnancy , it can be a surprise to get pregnant pretty quickly, much less the first time you try. That's exactly what happened to NCIS: New Orleans star Zoe McLellan. “For me, it was a bit too easy,” the 41-year-old actor said in an episode of People 's video series " Mom Talk ." McLellan said she told her then-boyfriend that she was looking to become a mom, and it happened right away. “We got pregnant the first time we had sex,” she says. “Pretty fast and furious.” We’ve all heard these stories of women who become pregnant as soon as they decide they want to be, but how common is that, really? Not very, but a fair amount of women get pregnant fairly quickly, Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF. This is what she tells her wannabe-pregnant patients (assuming they have unprotected sex twice a week): “50 percent will be pregnant within three months, 75 percent will be pregnant in six months, 90 percent will be pregnant in one year, and 95 percent will be pregnant in two years.” There are a few indicators that getting pregnant may be easier for you than for other women, Lauren Streicher, M.D., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, tells SELF. They include having regular periods (not just every month, but consistently the same number of days in each cycle), and having PMS symptoms like sore breasts and cramps before your period. These are all signs that your cycle is on track. Of course, it’s not always super-easy for many women to get pregnant, even if they time it correctly. “When you ovulate, the egg is only good for 24 hours each,” Whelihan says. “Even if you have [unprotected] sex on the right day of the month, there’s still only a 20 percent chance of conceiving [from that session].” Since sperm can live in your uterus for a few days, she recommends “getting some in there in advance” of ovulating. Ease of conceiving also depends on a woman’s age, says Streicher: “There’s a very big difference between what is expected for a 25-year-old and a 40-year-old." Streicher tells her older patients who say they want to start trying that they should begin tracking their ovulation . If they’re not ovulating regularly or haven’t gotten pregnant within four months, they should see their doctor. And in general, “If [a woman over 35] has been trying for four months, it’s an appropriate time to look at things,” she says. On the other hand, if you're under 35, doctors typically recommend that you wait until you’ve been trying for a year before seeing them to talk about possible next steps. It’s important to remember that it’s not necessarily about you. “When patients aren’t conceiving, 40 percent of the reasons are due to male factors, like low sperm count and bad swimmers,” Whelihan says. No matter what, if you don’t get pregnant right away, try to worry as little as possible—even though that can be incredibly tough—and manage your stress in a healthy way. "The time it takes a person to get pregnant varies significantly from woman to woman," women's health expert Jennifer Wider , M.D., tells SELF. "Unfortunately, it isn't something we can control, so stressing over it usually doesn't help." If you’re ready to get pregnant, like, yesterday, it’s natural that you wouldn’t want to wait a whole year to see what's going on, and experts get that. There's no rule that says you absolutely have to wait before calling up your doctor. “I tell women they have to be very proactive,” Streicher says. As soon as you talk your concerns over with a medical professional, you'll be one step closer to actually getting pregnant.

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest in flagrante in a public place. So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom. Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions – a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate. Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from a European study that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation – the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle. The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy – this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young. Calculating success So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: “fecundability”. This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%. So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 – 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%. Reducing risk But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant – how effective are different types of contraception? This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.  Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will end up pregnant each year . Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 – or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government’s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target. Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a 2001 UNICEF report , the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers. The Netherlands is just over the channel from the UK and yet their youth clearly have a very different approach to sex. Unfortunate end Finally, we should never forget the risks of such an energetic pursuit. Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks are triggered by sexual activity.  Luminaries such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have succumbed in this way. Solo sexual activity used to be associated with blindness and stunted growth, for which there is a limited evidence-base to say the least. But if it involves asphyxiation it is not recommended for the cautious, with numerous fatalities recorded, including the actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a UK Member of Parliament. One study recorded as many as 117 deaths from just two provinces in Canada . The moral of all this is, possibly, that sex can be just as much about risk as morality.

For a healthy, fertile couple where both partners are under the age of 35, the chance of getting pregnant straight away is actually pretty low – it’s estimated at around 25 percent per month, if you have regular unprotected sex around the time of ovulation .  If you’re not actively trying to conceive and not planning intercourse to occur around the time of conception , but you are having regular unprotected sex, your chances of getting pregnant drop to just 11 percent per month.  That’s why doctors have traditionally suggested waiting until you have been trying for a baby for a year before starting fertility investigations , although many couples choose to start preliminary investigations after six months, particularly if they are over thirty.  How do the chances of getting pregnant change as I get older?  On average, a woman with no fertility issues will fall pregnant after four months of trying to get pregnant – but from around the age of 21, fertility slowly declines with age until around 35, then declines faster until the age of 40, after which fertility decline is very rapid.  There is much debate between scientists about the odds of conception.  Here is one of the most commonly cited estimates on the percentage chance of conception after one year of trying:   Age 20: 90% probability  Age 30: 70% probability  Age 35: 55% probability  Age 40: 45% probability  Age 45: 6% probability   A 2002 study by Dunson et al studied 782 healthy couples in Italy and the USA and found that there was great variability in the chances of getting pregnant on the peak day of conception (two days before ovulation). They estimated that, for a couple who were the same age, the odds of falling pregnant in any one menstrual cycle when having sex on the peak day for conception were:   Aged 19 to 26: 50% chance in any one menstrual cycle  Aged 27 to 34: 40% chance in any one menstrual cycle  Aged 35 to 39: less than 30% chance in any one menstrual cycle, but with a male partner five years older, the chance falls to less than 20% chance in any one menstrual cycle   This research suggested that smoking, sexually transmitted disease history and occupational exposures contributed to lower fertility rates.  Can IVF improve fertility rates for older women?  Increased use of assisted conception treatments by older couples has helped promote the idea that fertility treatments like IVF can postpone the natural decline of fertility.  However, success rates for IVF still mirror those of natural fertility, with reports issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) show that the rate of live births from IVF and similar treatments using the mother’s eggs decreases with age.  The latest figures show that for women under 35, the percentage of live births after one cycle of assisted reproductive treatments (including IVF ) was about 45%.  Success rates declined after this age group. For those between ages 35-37 it was about 37%, dropping steadily to just 6.6% for those aged over 42.  But older women can dramatically raise their IVF success rates by using an egg donor; the CDC report states that the chance of a fertilised egg implanting depends on the age of the woman who produced the egg.  Success rates for women, even in their mid-forties, who use a donor egg from a woman in her 20s or early 30s remains above 40%.  Many women have no trouble falling pregnant over 35 or even over forty; but if you’re over 35 and haven’t fallen pregnant after six months, it’s worth talking to your doctor and starting fertility investigations.  What can be done to improve my odds?  Plenty of products, consultants and websites promise to improve your chances of getting pregnant – for a price. But many are rip-offs with no scientific evidence, which prey on the vulnerability of people keen to have a baby.  Here’s some tips on improving your chances of getting pregnant , without paying a fortune:  Reduce your stress levels  There’s a strong correlation between stress levels and fertility. If the main reason you’re stressed is that you want to have a baby, then this is hollow-sounding advice indeed.But there are often ways you can change other stresses in your life; take a holiday; re-think your job or other commitments that might shift down your priority list.  Aim for a healthy weight  Research shows that there is a strong connection between obesity in women and lower fertility. Being significantly underweight for long periods of time can also negatively impact your fertility. Try for a healthy balance!  Improve your diet  While research evidence is inconclusive, some fertility experts swear by a diet of organic foods. It’s your choice whether to go all-out or just keep an eye on your food choices (eating at home and avoiding takeaway is a good start!)  Quit smoking and cut back on the booze  There’s a strong link between smoking and reduced fertility in both men and women; this might be enough of an incentive to help you kick the habit.  Regular exercise  You don’t have to become a gym junkie – in fact, it’s better if you’re not – but some regular exercise each day can’t hurt; and if a nice long walk reduces your stress levels and improves your cardio status, it might well help your chances of getting pregnant.
