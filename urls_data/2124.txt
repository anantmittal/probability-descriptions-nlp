That's what's at stake in this little experiment.   Image: John Rogers/Camelot/RBS/PA Archive      ANYONE WHO EVER sits down to work out the probability of winning a major lottery usually tends to end up pretty disappointed at the long-shot odds of taking the main jackpot.  The odds of winning Ireland’s National Lottery are 8,145,060 to 1, for example, while the odds of winning the British equivalent are a whopping 13,983,815 to 1.  In the Euromillions, the odds get even higher – the odds of winning the biggest prize in the 12-country lottery is a scarcely comprehensible 116,531,800 to 1.  That’s to say: if everyone on the entire planet was able to enter, on average there would only be sixty winners, globally – each having to take a significantly smaller share of the jackpot.  Longtime readers of TheJournal.ie will know that every once in a while, when the biggest jackpots come along, we run over the probability of winning the biggest jackpots – and point out that it’s potentially possible to guarantee a profit whenever the Irish jackpot breaches €12.2 million.  This is because, if you had that amount of cash already, you could buy 8,145,060 tickets (costing €1.50 per line) to cover every single possible combination of numbers that would arise.  History lesson  In fact, this has happened in Ireland in the past: on the Bank Holiday weekend of May 1992, the rollover jackpot of £1.7 million was almost double the cost (£973,896) of buying every single one of the 1,947,792 combinations of numbers.  One syndicate of 28 people, preparing for the day when the jackpot would rollover, had spent six months filling out playslips – and managed to buy about 80 per cent of the possible combinations.  In the end, they shared the main jackpot prize with two other people – but the number of match-5 and match-4 prizes meant they still earned a tidy £300,000 profit. To counter this every happening again, the Lotto increased the number of balls in the draw.  While the main jackpot prize in the Euromillions has an artificial ceiling – with the 12 participating lotteries agreeing to cap the maximum prize at €190 million – a similar scheme is still possible, where buying every possible combination of ticket could bring it home.  We’ve been crunching the numbers, and extrapolating the trends from the last draw on Friday night, to try and figure out if it’s possible with the Euromillions.  So, for this example, we’re assuming you have (a) enough money to buy every single ticket possible, and (b) an elaborate system which would allow you to buy all the tickets online and not have to spend moneys filling in every possible slip.  Here are our findings.  First, a quick recap  Winning the main prize in the Euromillions requires you to match 5 numbers out of 50, and 2 ‘Lucky Star’ numbers out of 11. The odds, as we mentioned, are 116,531,800 to 1. This means buying every combination of numbers will cost you €233,063,600.  There are 13 different categories of prize – from matching all 7 numbers (5 regular numbers plus 2 Lucky Stars) down to matching 2 regular numbers and 0 stars.  If you buy every single combination of ticket, this means you’re guaranteed to win one jackpot prize (5+2), 18 of the ’5 plus 1′ prizes, and 36 of the ’5 plus 0′ prizes, and so on – all the way down to your 5,108,400 tickets which will have matched 2 regular numbers and no Lucky Stars.  All in all, of the 116 million tickets you’ve bought, 9,106,405 will be winners to some degree. But here comes the big question…  How much will they win?  Having crunched the numbers above, you’ll see there’s a 7.81 per cent chance that any individual combination of numbers will win a prize. It’s possible to take this number and use it to figure out exactly how many other people are playing.  Now, take a look at the results for last Friday’s draw – where the main jackpot of €120 million went unclaimed. Across Europe, there were a total of 4,546,468 winning tickets.  So assuming that the odds remain true (and, by and large, there’s no reason for them not to) and 4,546,468 winning tickets represents 7.81 per cent of all tickets sold, we can estimate the total number of tickets sold for last Friday’s draw at 58,179,721.  Let’s assume that Tuesday’s jackpot, given the bigger prize at stake, attracts a bumper crowd, and that there are a total of 65 million other ticket sales – you’ll still hold almost two-thirds of the total number of tickets for the draw.  Now, let’s go back again to last Friday’s draw. See the prizes for each combination? They fluctuate depending on how many other winners there are – if the jackpot goes unclaimed, the lower prizes get proportionally higher.  Fixed breakdown  For an original jackpot of €15 million, the ratios between the prizes given out at each level are fixed for each draw, with the jackpot amounting to 32 per cent of the total fund. ( Full details are on page 13 of this PDF .)  If the jackpot isn’t won, its part is rolled over until next time – meaning that it becomes worth proportionally more and more of the total pot, the longer and longer it goes on.  This has a very important effect – because it means that the bigger the jackpot gets (and the closer it becomes to messing with, like this), the less and less cash becomes available to cover the holders of lesser tickets.  This Tuesday’s draw is the 15th since the last time the jackpot was won – meaning the biggest prize will account for 87.6 per cent of the total winnings.  And there, readers, is the problem. If the jackpot takes up so much of the prize fund, then only 12.4 per cent of it is left to be distributed among the winners of other prizes.  Diminishing returns  You might have 9.1 million tickets that win prizes, but each of them is going to be worth a fairly piddly amount. Assuming the main jackpot is worth €130 million (as advertised – though it’s likely to be higher) then the amount to be split between the 5+1 winners is only €1.3 million.  You’ll have 18 winning tickets, while there are likely to be an average of seven others among the 65 million tickets sold. This means the €1.3 million is split 25 ways. You’ll take 18 of those chunks, meaning €947,388 for each.  Similarly, the fund for the 5+0 winners is diminished to €433,333 – and your share would only be €302,388. Eventually, your flood of winning tickets would be so large that each of your 2+0 winning tickets, which usually win €4 or €5 each, are only worth €1 apiece.  In short, your total winnings are €140,653,079 – but you’ve already spent €233,063,600. That’s a pretty hefty loss, and it gets worse if, by fluke, someone else (improbably) wins the jackpot prize, and reduces your winnings by another €65 million.  Still, now you know – you just can’t beat the Euromillions system.

Hannah Boland        29 September 2017 • 10:06pm        N ext Tuesday will see the biggest UK jackpot ever up for grabs, after tonight's EuroMillions draw saw no-one walk away with the £157m prize.  The numbers for the draw were.  7, 18, 19, 32, 48 and the Lucky Stars are 3 and 7  However, as no-one correctly picked all five main numbers and two 'Lucky Stars', the jackpot will roll over to next Tuesday, and is estimated to be £167m.  This would make whoever has the winning ticket the biggest jackpot winner ever in the UK and Europe, ahead of Colin and Chris Weir, from North Ayrshire, who won £161.65m in 2011.       In numbers | Euromillions        T he EuroMillions draw has been running since 2004, and there are now nine European countries participating in it - the UK, France, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg.  The odds of scooping the jackpot are 1 in 139.8m and the overall odds of winning a EuroMillions prize are 1 in 13.  Jim Forbes, from Fife in Scotland, went home with a £655,838 Euromillions prize from last Friday's draw, only realising he had won while buying a Lotto ticket at the supermarket. He had matched five numbers and a 'Lucky Star'.  There have been four EuroMillions jackpots won in the UK this year, although overall, players from France have won the most jackpots in the draw's history.

Following changes to the chances of winning the Lotto jackpot, we look at how they compare to the odds of winning a Premium Bonds prize.

But what are the odds of winning and how do they compare to the likes of the National Lottery and the Health Lottery?  Why Premium Bonds are so popular  Premium Bonds are the nation’s most popular savings product with 21 million of us depositing a total of £53 billion. Of that number 250,000 have invested up to the previous limit of £40,000 and many of those people will doubtless be investing more now.  But why do we love Premium Bonds so much? There are two reasons.  Firstly, they are offered by National Savings & Investments (NS&I), the government’s bank. This means that all deposits are guaranteed by the Treasury so there is no risk of you losing your money and you can withdraw it at any time.  But the bigger reason so many of us choose to pour our savings into Premium Bonds is the prize fund. Each bond is entered into a monthly draw for a prize of up to £1 million.  Given the fact Premium Bonds have been around since 1956 that means there are a lot of winners out there.   [Related story: Big money Premium Bonds prize-winning numbers]  Premium Bonds odds  So what are your odds of winning with Premium Bonds?  NS&I will tell you that you stand a one in 26,000 chance of winning a prize for each £1 bond you own.  But those odds are for winning any Premium Bond prize, not just the million.  If you look at winning one of the two million pound Premium Bond jackpots the odds lengthen massively to an astonishing one in 27 billion. To put that in context you are far more likely to be killed by a vending machine – the odds for that are one in 112 million.   [Related story: National Lottery winners who lost the lot]  How the odds compare to lotteries  The main National Lottery Lotto draw now has odds of 45 million to one for winning the jackpot. If you want to win more Euromillions offers bigger jackpots but far longer odds at 116.5 million to one, due to the fact the whole of Europe can take part.  If you want shorter odds go for the smaller prizes. The National Lottery’s Thunderball game has a jackpot of £500,000 and your odds of winning are eight million to one. Making it eight times less likely than you being killed by falling off a ladder this year.  Play the Health Lottery and you have a one in two million chance of taking home the £100,000 jackpot. That means you are more likely to win – so long as you buy a ticket – than be killed by lightning. The odds of death by lightning in the UK are one in three million.  So your chances of winning any big prize draw are pretty slim whether it’s the Euromillions or Premium Bonds. But just because the odds are long doesn’t mean it won’t happen.  The odds of the Bulgarian lottery drawing the same numbers on two consecutive weeks are around 4.2 million to one, but it happened in 2009.   Want to earn interest on your money instead?

Thousands of people are rushing to buy lottery tickets in an attempt to win the UK’s highest ever jackpot of £57.8 million - but the chance of winning is incredibly miniscule.  After increasing the number of balls from 49 to 59 in October, the National Lottery organisers reduced the odds on anyone’s six numbers coming up from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 45 million.

Buy EuroMillions Tickets  EuroMillions syndicates are incredibly popular as they increase a player's chances of winning without necessarily increasing the cost. Of course, any prizes won are shared between all syndicate members.  While there is no guarantee that playing each week, or as part of a syndicate, will secure a win, it is entirely feasible that you could win the jackpot the first time you buy a ticket. In 2013 17-year-old Jane Park of Midlothian, Scotland, won a £1 million prize after buying a lottery ticket for the very first time.  EuroMillions is a game of chance and the random, unpredictable nature of the lottery means that everyone is in with an equal chance of winning a prize regardless of personal circumstances. There is no reason why you couldn't be the next big winner - unless, of course, you don't buy a ticket.  *Excluding Superdraw or Event Draw jackpots which are a set amount. The jackpots in Superdraws have the ability to roll over to become an estimated amount in subsequent draws, once again based on anticipated ticket sales.

Well in this post I’m going to show you exactly how it’s done. I will be focusing on the Euro Millions in this post.  To win the Euro Million your numbers have to match the “randomly” drawn numbers by the lottery. The Game consists of   5 Numbers between 1 and 50 ( Main Board Numbers ) and   2 Numbers between 1 and 9 ( Lucky Star Numbers )   To start of, let’s think about something simpler and more intuitive: What are the chances of getting 1 number right? You choose a number between 1 and 50 and the lottery draws a random one. So what’s the probability of winning? Well, it’s fairly simple. 1 in 50 right? If you were able to choose 2 or more numbers to match the 1 number drawn by the lottery, your chances would add up. 2 in 50 for 2 chosen numbers, 3 in 50 for 3 chosen numbers and if you were able to choose all numbers, your chances would add up to 50 in 50 wich is equal to 100%. Simple.  Now let us add another number. The lottery draws 2 numbers and you choose 2 numbers. What are the chances now? We could say that the chance of getting both numbers right is equal to the chance of getting the first number right times the chance of getting the second number right times the number of possible permutations . This might sound a little complicated, but I’ll get back to what “permutations” means.  The chance of getting the first number right is very sraight forward. It is 1 in 50 or represented as a fraction: 1/50.  The chance of getting the second one right is also pretty simple. Since there are only 49 possible numbers left to pick from after the first number is drawn, the chance of getting the second number right is 1 in 49 or 1/49.  Multiplying both of these probabilities (1/50 and 1/49) is allmost going to get us the right answer. The reason I say allmost is, because we haven’t yet taken into consideration the permutation.  Now what is permutation ?  The probability above would give us the probability if the sequenze of the numbers actually matterd. So picking the numbers (2, 45) would be different than picking (45, 2). But this is not the case in lottery. If the lottery drew the numbers (1, 45, 13, 26, 50) in this order and you had chosen (50, 26, 13, 45, 1) you would have still won, even though your first number didn’t match the lotterys first number. So if we want to take this away from our probability, we have to multiply the existing probability by the permutation, which means nothing else than the number of ways you can arrange your chosen numbers. In our case (2 numbers) its fairly simple. Either you pick N1, N2 or N2, N1. But as the number of numbers get bigger the number of permutations also get bigger, in fact: The number of permutations is equal to the factorial of the number which would be denoted as N!, where N is your chosen number. To calculate the factoral of a number, you multiply all positiv integers less than or equal to your number. For instance 5! would equal to 1*2*3*4*5. So in our case it would be 2!, which is equal to 1*2 =2. So we multiply the given probability (1/50*1/49) by 2 and end uf with a probability of 1 in 1225 .  Now What is the probability of getting all 5 numbers right?  So we use the same system. We multiply the probabilities of each number (1/50 * 1/49 * 1/48 * 1/47 * 1/46 = 1/254251200) and then multiply by the number of permutations (5! = 5*4*3*2*1 or 120) which would give the probability of getting the first 5  numbers right (1 in 2,118,760 ). But were still not finnished. We have to also add (multiply) the probability of getting the last 2 numbers right, which we can calculate easily now. The chances are 1/9 for the first “Lucky Star Number” and 1/8 for the second one. The number of permutations are 2! (2) so the the probabilities add up to (1/9 * 1/8)*2 = 1/36.  So now we can calculate the total probability of winning the Euro Million Jackpot, since it is equal to the product of the probability of getting the first 5 “Main board Numbers” right and the probability of getting the last 2 “Lucky Star Numbers” right. which equals (1/2118760 * 1/36 = 1/76275360). So therefore the probability is exactly 1 in 76,275,360 .  Have “luck” winning 🙂       Advertisements                Like this: Like  Loading...

That's what's at stake in this little experiment.   Image: John Rogers/Camelot/RBS/PA Archive      ANYONE WHO EVER sits down to work out the probability of winning a major lottery usually tends to end up pretty disappointed at the long-shot odds of taking the main jackpot.  The odds of winning Ireland’s National Lottery are 8,145,060 to 1, for example, while the odds of winning the British equivalent are a whopping 13,983,815 to 1.  In the Euromillions, the odds get even higher – the odds of winning the biggest prize in the 12-country lottery is a scarcely comprehensible 116,531,800 to 1.  That’s to say: if everyone on the entire planet was able to enter, on average there would only be sixty winners, globally – each having to take a significantly smaller share of the jackpot.  Longtime readers of TheJournal.ie will know that every once in a while, when the biggest jackpots come along, we run over the probability of winning the biggest jackpots – and point out that it’s potentially possible to guarantee a profit whenever the Irish jackpot breaches €12.2 million.  This is because, if you had that amount of cash already, you could buy 8,145,060 tickets (costing €1.50 per line) to cover every single possible combination of numbers that would arise.  History lesson  In fact, this has happened in Ireland in the past: on the Bank Holiday weekend of May 1992, the rollover jackpot of £1.7 million was almost double the cost (£973,896) of buying every single one of the 1,947,792 combinations of numbers.  One syndicate of 28 people, preparing for the day when the jackpot would rollover, had spent six months filling out playslips – and managed to buy about 80 per cent of the possible combinations.  In the end, they shared the main jackpot prize with two other people – but the number of match-5 and match-4 prizes meant they still earned a tidy £300,000 profit. To counter this every happening again, the Lotto increased the number of balls in the draw.  While the main jackpot prize in the Euromillions has an artificial ceiling – with the 12 participating lotteries agreeing to cap the maximum prize at €190 million – a similar scheme is still possible, where buying every possible combination of ticket could bring it home.  We’ve been crunching the numbers, and extrapolating the trends from the last draw on Friday night, to try and figure out if it’s possible with the Euromillions.  So, for this example, we’re assuming you have (a) enough money to buy every single ticket possible, and (b) an elaborate system which would allow you to buy all the tickets online and not have to spend moneys filling in every possible slip.  Here are our findings.  First, a quick recap  Winning the main prize in the Euromillions requires you to match 5 numbers out of 50, and 2 ‘Lucky Star’ numbers out of 11. The odds, as we mentioned, are 116,531,800 to 1. This means buying every combination of numbers will cost you €233,063,600.  There are 13 different categories of prize – from matching all 7 numbers (5 regular numbers plus 2 Lucky Stars) down to matching 2 regular numbers and 0 stars.  If you buy every single combination of ticket, this means you’re guaranteed to win one jackpot prize (5+2), 18 of the ’5 plus 1′ prizes, and 36 of the ’5 plus 0′ prizes, and so on – all the way down to your 5,108,400 tickets which will have matched 2 regular numbers and no Lucky Stars.  All in all, of the 116 million tickets you’ve bought, 9,106,405 will be winners to some degree. But here comes the big question…  How much will they win?  Having crunched the numbers above, you’ll see there’s a 7.81 per cent chance that any individual combination of numbers will win a prize. It’s possible to take this number and use it to figure out exactly how many other people are playing.  Now, take a look at the results for last Friday’s draw – where the main jackpot of €120 million went unclaimed. Across Europe, there were a total of 4,546,468 winning tickets.  So assuming that the odds remain true (and, by and large, there’s no reason for them not to) and 4,546,468 winning tickets represents 7.81 per cent of all tickets sold, we can estimate the total number of tickets sold for last Friday’s draw at 58,179,721.  Let’s assume that Tuesday’s jackpot, given the bigger prize at stake, attracts a bumper crowd, and that there are a total of 65 million other ticket sales – you’ll still hold almost two-thirds of the total number of tickets for the draw.  Now, let’s go back again to last Friday’s draw. See the prizes for each combination? They fluctuate depending on how many other winners there are – if the jackpot goes unclaimed, the lower prizes get proportionally higher.  Fixed breakdown  For an original jackpot of €15 million, the ratios between the prizes given out at each level are fixed for each draw, with the jackpot amounting to 32 per cent of the total fund. ( Full details are on page 13 of this PDF .)  If the jackpot isn’t won, its part is rolled over until next time – meaning that it becomes worth proportionally more and more of the total pot, the longer and longer it goes on.  This has a very important effect – because it means that the bigger the jackpot gets (and the closer it becomes to messing with, like this), the less and less cash becomes available to cover the holders of lesser tickets.  This Tuesday’s draw is the 15th since the last time the jackpot was won – meaning the biggest prize will account for 87.6 per cent of the total winnings.  And there, readers, is the problem. If the jackpot takes up so much of the prize fund, then only 12.4 per cent of it is left to be distributed among the winners of other prizes.  Diminishing returns  You might have 9.1 million tickets that win prizes, but each of them is going to be worth a fairly piddly amount. Assuming the main jackpot is worth €130 million (as advertised – though it’s likely to be higher) then the amount to be split between the 5+1 winners is only €1.3 million.  You’ll have 18 winning tickets, while there are likely to be an average of seven others among the 65 million tickets sold. This means the €1.3 million is split 25 ways. You’ll take 18 of those chunks, meaning €947,388 for each.  Similarly, the fund for the 5+0 winners is diminished to €433,333 – and your share would only be €302,388. Eventually, your flood of winning tickets would be so large that each of your 2+0 winning tickets, which usually win €4 or €5 each, are only worth €1 apiece.  In short, your total winnings are €140,653,079 – but you’ve already spent €233,063,600. That’s a pretty hefty loss, and it gets worse if, by fluke, someone else (improbably) wins the jackpot prize, and reduces your winnings by another €65 million.  Still, now you know – you just can’t beat the Euromillions system.

There are almost as many ways of choosing lottery numbers as there are chances of winning it.  With a must-win £24.7 million jackpot up for grabs this week , picking the right numbers could change your life.  However, the first thing to realise is that the odds are stacked against you.  The chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 (or approximately 1 in 14 million), while there is a 1 in 2,330,636 chance of getting five numbers plus the bonus ball.  There is a one in 55,000 chance of five of your numbers being selected by the lottery machine.  To win the Euromillions jackpot there is a one in 116.5 million of all your numbers being drawn.       Changes to the National Lottery        T he chance winning any of the lottery prizes, however small,  is approximately 54 to 1. So an average of one million people per draw will likely win a prize.  But is there a way of narrowing these odds? Let's take a look at some of the options:  Picking the most commonly drawn numbers  One approach would be to choose the numbers that come up most often. At the moment the most frequently drawn ball is the number 44 .  Since the National Lottery began in 1994, it has been drawn 253 times.  The other most common numbers are:   38 – 251 times  40 – 249 times  23 – 248 times  39 – 246 times  33 – 245 times   However, their frequency of appearance is no indication that they will be drawn together. In fact, the chance of these numbers cropping up in a winning combination is the same as any other set of six.           1. Choosing the birthdays of family or friends  F or those who use birthdays, five of the most commonly drawn numbers are more than 31, meaning they are not likely to have picked them.  Sticking to birthdays certainly limits the range of numbers you can choose and this is a common system, so more people are likely to pick those numbers, meaning you may have to share your prize.                 And the winner is...   Credit: PA          2. Picking overdue numbers  A nother approach that is commonly used is to look for numbers that have not come up in a while.  Human intuition tells us that if something has not happened in a while, then it is probably overdue.  Currently the most overdue number is 48 – it has not been picked in nearly 81 days. Similarly, the numbers 23 and 46 last appeared 77 days ago.  The 21 ball came up 63 days ago while number 14 was selected 60 days ago and number 2 emerged 56 days ago.  The least picked numbers are 20, 13, 21, 41, 16, and 37.  However, while the concept that things which are overdue will eventually happen makes sense, it does not mean they will when it comes to the National Lottery .                 In it to win it   Credit: Paul Grover          D r John Haigh, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Sussex who has written a paper on the statistics underlying the National Lottery, said: “Just because a number has not come up for a while does not mean it will in the next draw.  “Just as you flip a coin, if you get five heads in a row, it does not mean the next time it is more likely to be tails. The odds are still 50/50.           “So with the lottery, they remain one in 14 million.”  3. Lucky numbers  L ike birthdays, this is a common approach, steeped more in superstition than any real logic. But some people are naturally drawn to certain numbers in the same way they may have a favourite colour.  Interestingly the most commonly chosen numbers are those that end in a 7 according to work done by experimental physicist Jonathan Clarke .  The key here is having enough lucky numbers to fill an entire lottery ticket – if you have to borrow numbers from someone else then they are not really lucky any more are they?  And if you win, are you going to share the jackpot with them?  4. Picking previous winning numbers  Analysis of the Swiss lottery revealed has revealed a surprising trend – people tend to choose their numbers based on the previous week’s winning numbers.  Others were found to use the jackpot numbers from two weeks before and some further back than that.  Does this make any difference? Sadly, Dr Haigh tells us the odds remain the same. But it does make picking the numbers easier.  5. Pick the best-ever performing ticket  If you had selected the ticket 03 06 13 23 27 49 in every draw since the National Lottery started you would have won £2,017,671 according to analyst Richard Lloyd .  He has found that this ticket has been the best performing in the history of the lottery so far in terms of the number of prize winning matches.           H owever, the odds of that combination coming up again remain the same.  6. The appliance of science  There is a multitude of reading material giving advice about how win the lottery.  For upwards of £20 of your hard -earned money, you too can learn how to use complicated maths or systems like wheeling to pick your numbers.  Wheeling, which is one of the most popular systems, involves buying multiple tickets and using seven numbers rather six across those, for example.  Prediction software is also widely available on the internet with accompanying claims of great accuracy.  In fact, none of these have ever been proven to be effective and experts say those that with enough people using these systems, simple statistics says some people will win using them.  Indeed, perhaps the only people who really win from these approaches are the people who pocket the cash being paid for the books in the first place.  7. The random selection  Surprisingly, this is seen as the best approach by experts.  Not because it increases your chance of winning, but because it increases your chance of winning MORE.  By selecting numbers that use systems employed by others, it is more likely that other people will also have picked those numbers too.  If your numbers were to win the jackpot, then you would have to share more of your prize with those other people.  Randomly plucking numbers means the combination is least likely to have been selected by someone else.  “If you pick the least popular numbers and win, then you will probably share your jackpot with fewer people,” explains Dr Haigh.           8. Try the aesthetic approach  I n the ninth ever draw of the National Lottery in 1995, there were a record breaking 133 winners who shared the £16 million jackpot.  Analysis of the numbers revealed an interesting phenomenon – all of the numbers were contained within the three inside columns of the playing slip at the time.  There were also no two numbers on the same row nor adjacent to each other. It appears the numbers were selected randomly for the way they looked on the slip.  Dr Haigh says: “This is a really lazy way of choosing numbers as it is an easy thing to do.  “People do like to make pretty patterns on their playing slip.  “Research on the Swiss lottery has also shown that a lot of people select numbers that go diagonally across or down the slip, for example.”  However, Dr Haigh has some final words of wisdom that may help you decide which of these methods to use.

It is ridiculous to think otherwise.”  But remember, if any of these tips actually do result in a jackpot win, I’m more than happy to share some of the prize.

This was the question I asked myself several years ago when making the decision to play the nation's favourite flutter on a regular basis. I couldn't improve the chances of my chosen numbers being selected but could I give myself a better chance of not sharing my winnings if my numbers were selected? The numbers which come out of the machine are random, but the numbers which people choose are not random (unless selected using the Lucky Dip option). If I couldn't play the machine, could I play the opponent?  Several academic papers have been written on this subject, and businesses have even been set up to sell information to players wanting to avoid sharing any winnings. Examples such as January 14th 1995 when 133 winners shared the £16 million jackpot and each won around £122,500 instead is clearly enough motivation for people to look into this.  Official statistics around the numbers selected for the National Lottery were released in the early days of the game, but are no longer published. However, one way to extract information around player preferences is by considering two subsets of all the Lottery draws which have taken place – those when there was a winner of the jackpot, and those when there was no winner.  Of the 1,759 Lottery draws between its launch on November 19th 1994 and October 31st 2012, there were 1,398 where there was a jackpot winner and 361 where there was no winner. I considered these subsets independently, looking at the frequency of the drawn numbers within both and how this compared with that expected by probability. I was careful to remove sampling bias introduced by the random nature of the draws. This would avoid for instance a scenario where a number which has been drawn far more than predicted across all draws appearing more than expected in either subset purely due to random selection bias.  If there truly is conscious selection at work, then we would expect an unpopular number to appear less than expected within the jackpot subset, and more than expected within the roll-over subset. This approach treats each number as an independent entity and does not take into account that numbers are selected within a group of six. Thus, a number coupled by chance to a popular or unpopular number could itself be considered as so. This effect should become less significant as the sample size increases however, and as will be seen, the results output by this approach are explainable and not immediately spurious.  When combining outputs of the analysis of the two subsets into one metric, it is clear to see that there is noticeable conscious selection taking place. The graphic below displays the 49 possible numbers against a popularity scale, the taller the columns the greater the popularity. The red dotted line is the frequency of occurrence expected by probability.  Popularity measure as column height   There are clear patterns worth pointing out:  The oft-talked about 'birthday bias' is clear to see, where players use the birth dates of loved ones as a basis for number selection. We see in the graphic that smaller numbers are indeed far more popular than larger numbers.  31 however appears to be more popular than 29 and 30, despite the fact that it is less likely for a person to be born on the 31st of a month compared to the 29th and 30th . This may be due to the position of the numbers on the playslip.  13 is one of the most unpopular numbers within the 'birthday bias' region, which makes sense considering the cultural dislike of this number. Its neighbour 14 is also unpopular, perhaps due to it being skipped across along with 13 when the casual selector scans across the board from left to right.  The most popular number is 7, with the second most popular being 3. This finding is aligned to common knowledge around the public's attraction to these numbers, within "choose a number between 1 and 10" questions for instance.  There is also a clear popularity trend for lower numbers ending with a 7, namely 7, 17 and 27.  I have future plans to run further analysis to show how the geometry of the selection board also affects the popularity of numbers. I will also look to study the popularity of combinations of numbers.  Until then, to play the opponent it would be best to choose the numbers which are indicated as being unpopular (those with smaller columns in the graphic), to minimise the chance of another player having the same numbers. By publishing this analysis however, the effectiveness of the combination 32, 34, 39, 40, 46 and 48 has now been reduced! I would therefore suggest only dipping into this combination to avoid sharing a possible jackpot with the readership of the Understanding Uncertainty blog!

Can you post the numeric values for your analysis results?  I've already written a program to generate random numbers with weighted probabilities, but I'm currently using p(1-12) = 0; p(13-31) = 0.01; p(32-49)=0.045 (i.e. a simple avoidance of birthday numbers).  Also, do you have a similar analysis for the EuroLottery? Do our european neighbours have the same liking as us for 3,4, 7,12, 17, 27, etc?

I could post them but it would be good to see if someone repeating the method gets the same numbers! As for the EuroMillions, I have run the analysis but there's a bit more complexity in that one to deal with. For instance, a jackpot is matching all 5 numbers drawn from the main 50 and then the 2 numbers drawn from the Lucky Stars. So a jackpot win in this game incorporates conscious selection across two selection boards! Also, the Lucky Star selection board changed on May 10th 2011 with the number of possible balls increasing from 9 to 11. I've run the analysis on the pre-May 10th 2011 results, and get interpretable output for the Lucky Star selection board but not so much on the main selection board. I'm chalking this up to statistical noise due to the small sample size, but I need to look into it more.

I've been running my numbers for a few years now, and keep having to check that my Direct Debit is still active such is my lack of success! I've added in a bit of randomness to one of my numbers, given that choosing your numbers by analysing the data is itself a form of conscious selection which could mean increasing your risk of sharing the prize with another number cruncher. Does your analysis factor in any other elements (i.e. the number of winners are each prize point)?

If there are a large number of prize winners in a given tier, then the prize amount distributed to each winning ticket will be lower. If there are fewer winning tickets, the value of the prize will increase accordingly.

That's what's at stake in this little experiment.   Image: John Rogers/Camelot/RBS/PA Archive      ANYONE WHO EVER sits down to work out the probability of winning a major lottery usually tends to end up pretty disappointed at the long-shot odds of taking the main jackpot.  The odds of winning Ireland’s National Lottery are 8,145,060 to 1, for example, while the odds of winning the British equivalent are a whopping 13,983,815 to 1.  In the Euromillions, the odds get even higher – the odds of winning the biggest prize in the 12-country lottery is a scarcely comprehensible 116,531,800 to 1.  That’s to say: if everyone on the entire planet was able to enter, on average there would only be sixty winners, globally – each having to take a significantly smaller share of the jackpot.  Longtime readers of TheJournal.ie will know that every once in a while, when the biggest jackpots come along, we run over the probability of winning the biggest jackpots – and point out that it’s potentially possible to guarantee a profit whenever the Irish jackpot breaches €12.2 million.  This is because, if you had that amount of cash already, you could buy 8,145,060 tickets (costing €1.50 per line) to cover every single possible combination of numbers that would arise.  History lesson  In fact, this has happened in Ireland in the past: on the Bank Holiday weekend of May 1992, the rollover jackpot of £1.7 million was almost double the cost (£973,896) of buying every single one of the 1,947,792 combinations of numbers.  One syndicate of 28 people, preparing for the day when the jackpot would rollover, had spent six months filling out playslips – and managed to buy about 80 per cent of the possible combinations.  In the end, they shared the main jackpot prize with two other people – but the number of match-5 and match-4 prizes meant they still earned a tidy £300,000 profit. To counter this every happening again, the Lotto increased the number of balls in the draw.  While the main jackpot prize in the Euromillions has an artificial ceiling – with the 12 participating lotteries agreeing to cap the maximum prize at €190 million – a similar scheme is still possible, where buying every possible combination of ticket could bring it home.  We’ve been crunching the numbers, and extrapolating the trends from the last draw on Friday night, to try and figure out if it’s possible with the Euromillions.  So, for this example, we’re assuming you have (a) enough money to buy every single ticket possible, and (b) an elaborate system which would allow you to buy all the tickets online and not have to spend moneys filling in every possible slip.  Here are our findings.  First, a quick recap  Winning the main prize in the Euromillions requires you to match 5 numbers out of 50, and 2 ‘Lucky Star’ numbers out of 11. The odds, as we mentioned, are 116,531,800 to 1. This means buying every combination of numbers will cost you €233,063,600.  There are 13 different categories of prize – from matching all 7 numbers (5 regular numbers plus 2 Lucky Stars) down to matching 2 regular numbers and 0 stars.  If you buy every single combination of ticket, this means you’re guaranteed to win one jackpot prize (5+2), 18 of the ’5 plus 1′ prizes, and 36 of the ’5 plus 0′ prizes, and so on – all the way down to your 5,108,400 tickets which will have matched 2 regular numbers and no Lucky Stars.  All in all, of the 116 million tickets you’ve bought, 9,106,405 will be winners to some degree. But here comes the big question…  How much will they win?  Having crunched the numbers above, you’ll see there’s a 7.81 per cent chance that any individual combination of numbers will win a prize. It’s possible to take this number and use it to figure out exactly how many other people are playing.  Now, take a look at the results for last Friday’s draw – where the main jackpot of €120 million went unclaimed. Across Europe, there were a total of 4,546,468 winning tickets.  So assuming that the odds remain true (and, by and large, there’s no reason for them not to) and 4,546,468 winning tickets represents 7.81 per cent of all tickets sold, we can estimate the total number of tickets sold for last Friday’s draw at 58,179,721.  Let’s assume that Tuesday’s jackpot, given the bigger prize at stake, attracts a bumper crowd, and that there are a total of 65 million other ticket sales – you’ll still hold almost two-thirds of the total number of tickets for the draw.  Now, let’s go back again to last Friday’s draw. See the prizes for each combination? They fluctuate depending on how many other winners there are – if the jackpot goes unclaimed, the lower prizes get proportionally higher.  Fixed breakdown  For an original jackpot of €15 million, the ratios between the prizes given out at each level are fixed for each draw, with the jackpot amounting to 32 per cent of the total fund. ( Full details are on page 13 of this PDF .)  If the jackpot isn’t won, its part is rolled over until next time – meaning that it becomes worth proportionally more and more of the total pot, the longer and longer it goes on.  This has a very important effect – because it means that the bigger the jackpot gets (and the closer it becomes to messing with, like this), the less and less cash becomes available to cover the holders of lesser tickets.  This Tuesday’s draw is the 15th since the last time the jackpot was won – meaning the biggest prize will account for 87.6 per cent of the total winnings.  And there, readers, is the problem. If the jackpot takes up so much of the prize fund, then only 12.4 per cent of it is left to be distributed among the winners of other prizes.  Diminishing returns  You might have 9.1 million tickets that win prizes, but each of them is going to be worth a fairly piddly amount. Assuming the main jackpot is worth €130 million (as advertised – though it’s likely to be higher) then the amount to be split between the 5+1 winners is only €1.3 million.  You’ll have 18 winning tickets, while there are likely to be an average of seven others among the 65 million tickets sold. This means the €1.3 million is split 25 ways. You’ll take 18 of those chunks, meaning €947,388 for each.  Similarly, the fund for the 5+0 winners is diminished to €433,333 – and your share would only be €302,388. Eventually, your flood of winning tickets would be so large that each of your 2+0 winning tickets, which usually win €4 or €5 each, are only worth €1 apiece.  In short, your total winnings are €140,653,079 – but you’ve already spent €233,063,600. That’s a pretty hefty loss, and it gets worse if, by fluke, someone else (improbably) wins the jackpot prize, and reduces your winnings by another €65 million.  Still, now you know – you just can’t beat the Euromillions system.

Hannah Boland        29 September 2017 • 10:06pm        N ext Tuesday will see the biggest UK jackpot ever up for grabs, after tonight's EuroMillions draw saw no-one walk away with the £157m prize.  The numbers for the draw were.  7, 18, 19, 32, 48 and the Lucky Stars are 3 and 7  However, as no-one correctly picked all five main numbers and two 'Lucky Stars', the jackpot will roll over to next Tuesday, and is estimated to be £167m.  This would make whoever has the winning ticket the biggest jackpot winner ever in the UK and Europe, ahead of Colin and Chris Weir, from North Ayrshire, who won £161.65m in 2011.       In numbers | Euromillions        T he EuroMillions draw has been running since 2004, and there are now nine European countries participating in it - the UK, France, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg.  The odds of scooping the jackpot are 1 in 139.8m and the overall odds of winning a EuroMillions prize are 1 in 13.  Jim Forbes, from Fife in Scotland, went home with a £655,838 Euromillions prize from last Friday's draw, only realising he had won while buying a Lotto ticket at the supermarket.

Following changes to the chances of winning the Lotto jackpot, we look at how they compare to the odds of winning a Premium Bonds prize.

But what are the odds of winning and how do they compare to the likes of the National Lottery and the Health Lottery?  Why Premium Bonds are so popular  Premium Bonds are the nation’s most popular savings product with 21 million of us depositing a total of £53 billion. Of that number 250,000 have invested up to the previous limit of £40,000 and many of those people will doubtless be investing more now.  But why do we love Premium Bonds so much? There are two reasons.  Firstly, they are offered by National Savings & Investments (NS&I), the government’s bank. This means that all deposits are guaranteed by the Treasury so there is no risk of you losing your money and you can withdraw it at any time.  But the bigger reason so many of us choose to pour our savings into Premium Bonds is the prize fund. Each bond is entered into a monthly draw for a prize of up to £1 million.  Given the fact Premium Bonds have been around since 1956 that means there are a lot of winners out there.   [Related story: Big money Premium Bonds prize-winning numbers]  Premium Bonds odds  So what are your odds of winning with Premium Bonds?  NS&I will tell you that you stand a one in 26,000 chance of winning a prize for each £1 bond you own.  But those odds are for winning any Premium Bond prize, not just the million.  If you look at winning one of the two million pound Premium Bond jackpots the odds lengthen massively to an astonishing one in 27 billion. To put that in context you are far more likely to be killed by a vending machine – the odds for that are one in 112 million.   [Related story: National Lottery winners who lost the lot]  How the odds compare to lotteries  The main National Lottery Lotto draw now has odds of 45 million to one for winning the jackpot. If you want to win more Euromillions offers bigger jackpots but far longer odds at 116.5 million to one, due to the fact the whole of Europe can take part.  If you want shorter odds go for the smaller prizes. The National Lottery’s Thunderball game has a jackpot of £500,000 and your odds of winning are eight million to one. Making it eight times less likely than you being killed by falling off a ladder this year.  Play the Health Lottery and you have a one in two million chance of taking home the £100,000 jackpot. That means you are more likely to win – so long as you buy a ticket – than be killed by lightning. The odds of death by lightning in the UK are one in three million.  So your chances of winning any big prize draw are pretty slim whether it’s the Euromillions or Premium Bonds. But just because the odds are long doesn’t mean it won’t happen.  The odds of the Bulgarian lottery drawing the same numbers on two consecutive weeks are around 4.2 million to one, but it happened in 2009.   Want to earn interest on your money instead?

Thousands of people are rushing to buy lottery tickets in an attempt to win the UK’s highest ever jackpot of £57.8 million - but the chance of winning is incredibly miniscule.  After increasing the number of balls from 49 to 59 in October, the National Lottery organisers reduced the odds on anyone’s six numbers coming up from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 45 million.

Buy EuroMillions Tickets  EuroMillions syndicates are incredibly popular as they increase a player's chances of winning without necessarily increasing the cost. Of course, any prizes won are shared between all syndicate members.  While there is no guarantee that playing each week, or as part of a syndicate, will secure a win, it is entirely feasible that you could win the jackpot the first time you buy a ticket. In 2013 17-year-old Jane Park of Midlothian, Scotland, won a £1 million prize after buying a lottery ticket for the very first time.  EuroMillions is a game of chance and the random, unpredictable nature of the lottery means that everyone is in with an equal chance of winning a prize regardless of personal circumstances. There is no reason why you couldn't be the next big winner - unless, of course, you don't buy a ticket.  *Excluding Superdraw or Event Draw jackpots which are a set amount. The jackpots in Superdraws have the ability to roll over to become an estimated amount in subsequent draws, once again based on anticipated ticket sales.

Well in this post I’m going to show you exactly how it’s done. I will be focusing on the Euro Millions in this post.  To win the Euro Million your numbers have to match the “randomly” drawn numbers by the lottery. The Game consists of   5 Numbers between 1 and 50 ( Main Board Numbers ) and   2 Numbers between 1 and 9 ( Lucky Star Numbers )   To start of, let’s think about something simpler and more intuitive: What are the chances of getting 1 number right? You choose a number between 1 and 50 and the lottery draws a random one. So what’s the probability of winning? Well, it’s fairly simple. 1 in 50 right? If you were able to choose 2 or more numbers to match the 1 number drawn by the lottery, your chances would add up. 2 in 50 for 2 chosen numbers, 3 in 50 for 3 chosen numbers and if you were able to choose all numbers, your chances would add up to 50 in 50 wich is equal to 100%. Simple.  Now let us add another number. The lottery draws 2 numbers and you choose 2 numbers. What are the chances now? We could say that the chance of getting both numbers right is equal to the chance of getting the first number right times the chance of getting the second number right times the number of possible permutations . This might sound a little complicated, but I’ll get back to what “permutations” means.  The chance of getting the first number right is very sraight forward. It is 1 in 50 or represented as a fraction: 1/50.  The chance of getting the second one right is also pretty simple. Since there are only 49 possible numbers left to pick from after the first number is drawn, the chance of getting the second number right is 1 in 49 or 1/49.  Multiplying both of these probabilities (1/50 and 1/49) is allmost going to get us the right answer. The reason I say allmost is, because we haven’t yet taken into consideration the permutation.  Now what is permutation ?  The probability above would give us the probability if the sequenze of the numbers actually matterd. So picking the numbers (2, 45) would be different than picking (45, 2). But this is not the case in lottery. If the lottery drew the numbers (1, 45, 13, 26, 50) in this order and you had chosen (50, 26, 13, 45, 1) you would have still won, even though your first number didn’t match the lotterys first number. So if we want to take this away from our probability, we have to multiply the existing probability by the permutation, which means nothing else than the number of ways you can arrange your chosen numbers. In our case (2 numbers) its fairly simple. Either you pick N1, N2 or N2, N1. But as the number of numbers get bigger the number of permutations also get bigger, in fact: The number of permutations is equal to the factorial of the number which would be denoted as N!, where N is your chosen number. To calculate the factoral of a number, you multiply all positiv integers less than or equal to your number. For instance 5! would equal to 1*2*3*4*5. So in our case it would be 2!, which is equal to 1*2 =2. So we multiply the given probability (1/50*1/49) by 2 and end uf with a probability of 1 in 1225 .  Now What is the probability of getting all 5 numbers right?  So we use the same system. We multiply the probabilities of each number (1/50 * 1/49 * 1/48 * 1/47 * 1/46 = 1/254251200) and then multiply by the number of permutations (5! = 5*4*3*2*1 or 120) which would give the probability of getting the first 5  numbers right (1 in 2,118,760 ). But were still not finnished. We have to also add (multiply) the probability of getting the last 2 numbers right, which we can calculate easily now. The chances are 1/9 for the first “Lucky Star Number” and 1/8 for the second one. The number of permutations are 2! (2) so the the probabilities add up to (1/9 * 1/8)*2 = 1/36.  So now we can calculate the total probability of winning the Euro Million Jackpot, since it is equal to the product of the probability of getting the first 5 “Main board Numbers” right and the probability of getting the last 2 “Lucky Star Numbers” right. which equals (1/2118760 * 1/36 = 1/76275360). So therefore the probability is exactly 1 in 76,275,360 .  Have “luck” winning 🙂       Advertisements                Like this: Like  Loading...

That's what's at stake in this little experiment.   Image: John Rogers/Camelot/RBS/PA Archive      ANYONE WHO EVER sits down to work out the probability of winning a major lottery usually tends to end up pretty disappointed at the long-shot odds of taking the main jackpot.  The odds of winning Ireland’s National Lottery are 8,145,060 to 1, for example, while the odds of winning the British equivalent are a whopping 13,983,815 to 1.  In the Euromillions, the odds get even higher – the odds of winning the biggest prize in the 12-country lottery is a scarcely comprehensible 116,531,800 to 1.  That’s to say: if everyone on the entire planet was able to enter, on average there would only be sixty winners, globally – each having to take a significantly smaller share of the jackpot.  Longtime readers of TheJournal.ie will know that every once in a while, when the biggest jackpots come along, we run over the probability of winning the biggest jackpots – and point out that it’s potentially possible to guarantee a profit whenever the Irish jackpot breaches €12.2 million.  This is because, if you had that amount of cash already, you could buy 8,145,060 tickets (costing €1.50 per line) to cover every single possible combination of numbers that would arise.  History lesson  In fact, this has happened in Ireland in the past: on the Bank Holiday weekend of May 1992, the rollover jackpot of £1.7 million was almost double the cost (£973,896) of buying every single one of the 1,947,792 combinations of numbers.  One syndicate of 28 people, preparing for the day when the jackpot would rollover, had spent six months filling out playslips – and managed to buy about 80 per cent of the possible combinations.  In the end, they shared the main jackpot prize with two other people – but the number of match-5 and match-4 prizes meant they still earned a tidy £300,000 profit. To counter this every happening again, the Lotto increased the number of balls in the draw.  While the main jackpot prize in the Euromillions has an artificial ceiling – with the 12 participating lotteries agreeing to cap the maximum prize at €190 million – a similar scheme is still possible, where buying every possible combination of ticket could bring it home.  We’ve been crunching the numbers, and extrapolating the trends from the last draw on Friday night, to try and figure out if it’s possible with the Euromillions.  So, for this example, we’re assuming you have (a) enough money to buy every single ticket possible, and (b) an elaborate system which would allow you to buy all the tickets online and not have to spend moneys filling in every possible slip.  Here are our findings.  First, a quick recap  Winning the main prize in the Euromillions requires you to match 5 numbers out of 50, and 2 ‘Lucky Star’ numbers out of 11. The odds, as we mentioned, are 116,531,800 to 1. This means buying every combination of numbers will cost you €233,063,600.  There are 13 different categories of prize – from matching all 7 numbers (5 regular numbers plus 2 Lucky Stars) down to matching 2 regular numbers and 0 stars.  If you buy every single combination of ticket, this means you’re guaranteed to win one jackpot prize (5+2), 18 of the ’5 plus 1′ prizes, and 36 of the ’5 plus 0′ prizes, and so on – all the way down to your 5,108,400 tickets which will have matched 2 regular numbers and no Lucky Stars.  All in all, of the 116 million tickets you’ve bought, 9,106,405 will be winners to some degree. But here comes the big question…  How much will they win?  Having crunched the numbers above, you’ll see there’s a 7.81 per cent chance that any individual combination of numbers will win a prize. It’s possible to take this number and use it to figure out exactly how many other people are playing.  Now, take a look at the results for last Friday’s draw – where the main jackpot of €120 million went unclaimed. Across Europe, there were a total of 4,546,468 winning tickets.  So assuming that the odds remain true (and, by and large, there’s no reason for them not to) and 4,546,468 winning tickets represents 7.81 per cent of all tickets sold, we can estimate the total number of tickets sold for last Friday’s draw at 58,179,721.  Let’s assume that Tuesday’s jackpot, given the bigger prize at stake, attracts a bumper crowd, and that there are a total of 65 million other ticket sales – you’ll still hold almost two-thirds of the total number of tickets for the draw.  Now, let’s go back again to last Friday’s draw. See the prizes for each combination? They fluctuate depending on how many other winners there are – if the jackpot goes unclaimed, the lower prizes get proportionally higher.  Fixed breakdown  For an original jackpot of €15 million, the ratios between the prizes given out at each level are fixed for each draw, with the jackpot amounting to 32 per cent of the total fund. ( Full details are on page 13 of this PDF .)  If the jackpot isn’t won, its part is rolled over until next time – meaning that it becomes worth proportionally more and more of the total pot, the longer and longer it goes on.  This has a very important effect – because it means that the bigger the jackpot gets (and the closer it becomes to messing with, like this), the less and less cash becomes available to cover the holders of lesser tickets.  This Tuesday’s draw is the 15th since the last time the jackpot was won – meaning the biggest prize will account for 87.6 per cent of the total winnings.  And there, readers, is the problem. If the jackpot takes up so much of the prize fund, then only 12.4 per cent of it is left to be distributed among the winners of other prizes.  Diminishing returns  You might have 9.1 million tickets that win prizes, but each of them is going to be worth a fairly piddly amount. Assuming the main jackpot is worth €130 million (as advertised – though it’s likely to be higher) then the amount to be split between the 5+1 winners is only €1.3 million.  You’ll have 18 winning tickets, while there are likely to be an average of seven others among the 65 million tickets sold. This means the €1.3 million is split 25 ways. You’ll take 18 of those chunks, meaning €947,388 for each.  Similarly, the fund for the 5+0 winners is diminished to €433,333 – and your share would only be €302,388. Eventually, your flood of winning tickets would be so large that each of your 2+0 winning tickets, which usually win €4 or €5 each, are only worth €1 apiece.  In short, your total winnings are €140,653,079 – but you’ve already spent €233,063,600. That’s a pretty hefty loss, and it gets worse if, by fluke, someone else (improbably) wins the jackpot prize, and reduces your winnings by another €65 million.  Still, now you know – you just can’t beat the Euromillions system.

There are almost as many ways of choosing lottery numbers as there are chances of winning it.  With a must-win £24.7 million jackpot up for grabs this week , picking the right numbers could change your life.  However, the first thing to realise is that the odds are stacked against you.  The chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 (or approximately 1 in 14 million), while there is a 1 in 2,330,636 chance of getting five numbers plus the bonus ball.  There is a one in 55,000 chance of five of your numbers being selected by the lottery machine.  To win the Euromillions jackpot there is a one in 116.5 million of all your numbers being drawn.       Changes to the National Lottery        T he chance winning any of the lottery prizes, however small,  is approximately 54 to 1. So an average of one million people per draw will likely win a prize.  But is there a way of narrowing these odds? Let's take a look at some of the options:  Picking the most commonly drawn numbers  One approach would be to choose the numbers that come up most often. At the moment the most frequently drawn ball is the number 44 .  Since the National Lottery began in 1994, it has been drawn 253 times.  The other most common numbers are:   38 – 251 times  40 – 249 times  23 – 248 times  39 – 246 times  33 – 245 times   However, their frequency of appearance is no indication that they will be drawn together. In fact, the chance of these numbers cropping up in a winning combination is the same as any other set of six.           1. Choosing the birthdays of family or friends  F or those who use birthdays, five of the most commonly drawn numbers are more than 31, meaning they are not likely to have picked them.  Sticking to birthdays certainly limits the range of numbers you can choose and this is a common system, so more people are likely to pick those numbers, meaning you may have to share your prize.                 And the winner is...   Credit: PA          2. Picking overdue numbers  A nother approach that is commonly used is to look for numbers that have not come up in a while.  Human intuition tells us that if something has not happened in a while, then it is probably overdue.  Currently the most overdue number is 48 – it has not been picked in nearly 81 days. Similarly, the numbers 23 and 46 last appeared 77 days ago.  The 21 ball came up 63 days ago while number 14 was selected 60 days ago and number 2 emerged 56 days ago.  The least picked numbers are 20, 13, 21, 41, 16, and 37.  However, while the concept that things which are overdue will eventually happen makes sense, it does not mean they will when it comes to the National Lottery .                 In it to win it   Credit: Paul Grover          D r John Haigh, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Sussex who has written a paper on the statistics underlying the National Lottery, said: “Just because a number has not come up for a while does not mean it will in the next draw.  “Just as you flip a coin, if you get five heads in a row, it does not mean the next time it is more likely to be tails. The odds are still 50/50.           “So with the lottery, they remain one in 14 million.”  3. Lucky numbers  L ike birthdays, this is a common approach, steeped more in superstition than any real logic. But some people are naturally drawn to certain numbers in the same way they may have a favourite colour.  Interestingly the most commonly chosen numbers are those that end in a 7 according to work done by experimental physicist Jonathan Clarke .  The key here is having enough lucky numbers to fill an entire lottery ticket – if you have to borrow numbers from someone else then they are not really lucky any more are they?  And if you win, are you going to share the jackpot with them?  4. Picking previous winning numbers  Analysis of the Swiss lottery revealed has revealed a surprising trend – people tend to choose their numbers based on the previous week’s winning numbers.  Others were found to use the jackpot numbers from two weeks before and some further back than that.  Does this make any difference? Sadly, Dr Haigh tells us the odds remain the same. But it does make picking the numbers easier.  5. Pick the best-ever performing ticket  If you had selected the ticket 03 06 13 23 27 49 in every draw since the National Lottery started you would have won £2,017,671 according to analyst Richard Lloyd .  He has found that this ticket has been the best performing in the history of the lottery so far in terms of the number of prize winning matches.           H owever, the odds of that combination coming up again remain the same.  6. The appliance of science  There is a multitude of reading material giving advice about how win the lottery.  For upwards of £20 of your hard -earned money, you too can learn how to use complicated maths or systems like wheeling to pick your numbers.  Wheeling, which is one of the most popular systems, involves buying multiple tickets and using seven numbers rather six across those, for example.  Prediction software is also widely available on the internet with accompanying claims of great accuracy.  In fact, none of these have ever been proven to be effective and experts say those that with enough people using these systems, simple statistics says some people will win using them.  Indeed, perhaps the only people who really win from these approaches are the people who pocket the cash being paid for the books in the first place.  7. The random selection  Surprisingly, this is seen as the best approach by experts.  Not because it increases your chance of winning, but because it increases your chance of winning MORE.  By selecting numbers that use systems employed by others, it is more likely that other people will also have picked those numbers too.  If your numbers were to win the jackpot, then you would have to share more of your prize with those other people.  Randomly plucking numbers means the combination is least likely to have been selected by someone else.  “If you pick the least popular numbers and win, then you will probably share your jackpot with fewer people,” explains Dr Haigh.           8. Try the aesthetic approach  I n the ninth ever draw of the National Lottery in 1995, there were a record breaking 133 winners who shared the £16 million jackpot.  Analysis of the numbers revealed an interesting phenomenon – all of the numbers were contained within the three inside columns of the playing slip at the time.  There were also no two numbers on the same row nor adjacent to each other. It appears the numbers were selected randomly for the way they looked on the slip.  Dr Haigh says: “This is a really lazy way of choosing numbers as it is an easy thing to do.  “People do like to make pretty patterns on their playing slip.  “Research on the Swiss lottery has also shown that a lot of people select numbers that go diagonally across or down the slip, for example.”  However, Dr Haigh has some final words of wisdom that may help you decide which of these methods to use.  He says: “Whatever method you chose, the chances of your six numbers coming up remain the same. It is ridiculous to think otherwise.”  But remember, if any of these tips actually do result in a jackpot win, I’m more than happy to share some of the prize.

This was the question I asked myself several years ago when making the decision to play the nation's favourite flutter on a regular basis. I couldn't improve the chances of my chosen numbers being selected but could I give myself a better chance of not sharing my winnings if my numbers were selected? The numbers which come out of the machine are random, but the numbers which people choose are not random (unless selected using the Lucky Dip option). If I couldn't play the machine, could I play the opponent?  Several academic papers have been written on this subject, and businesses have even been set up to sell information to players wanting to avoid sharing any winnings. Examples such as January 14th 1995 when 133 winners shared the £16 million jackpot and each won around £122,500 instead is clearly enough motivation for people to look into this.  Official statistics around the numbers selected for the National Lottery were released in the early days of the game, but are no longer published. However, one way to extract information around player preferences is by considering two subsets of all the Lottery draws which have taken place – those when there was a winner of the jackpot, and those when there was no winner.  Of the 1,759 Lottery draws between its launch on November 19th 1994 and October 31st 2012, there were 1,398 where there was a jackpot winner and 361 where there was no winner. I considered these subsets independently, looking at the frequency of the drawn numbers within both and how this compared with that expected by probability. I was careful to remove sampling bias introduced by the random nature of the draws. This would avoid for instance a scenario where a number which has been drawn far more than predicted across all draws appearing more than expected in either subset purely due to random selection bias.  If there truly is conscious selection at work, then we would expect an unpopular number to appear less than expected within the jackpot subset, and more than expected within the roll-over subset. This approach treats each number as an independent entity and does not take into account that numbers are selected within a group of six. Thus, a number coupled by chance to a popular or unpopular number could itself be considered as so. This effect should become less significant as the sample size increases however, and as will be seen, the results output by this approach are explainable and not immediately spurious.  When combining outputs of the analysis of the two subsets into one metric, it is clear to see that there is noticeable conscious selection taking place. The graphic below displays the 49 possible numbers against a popularity scale, the taller the columns the greater the popularity. The red dotted line is the frequency of occurrence expected by probability.  Popularity measure as column height   There are clear patterns worth pointing out:  The oft-talked about 'birthday bias' is clear to see, where players use the birth dates of loved ones as a basis for number selection. We see in the graphic that smaller numbers are indeed far more popular than larger numbers.  31 however appears to be more popular than 29 and 30, despite the fact that it is less likely for a person to be born on the 31st of a month compared to the 29th and 30th . This may be due to the position of the numbers on the playslip.  13 is one of the most unpopular numbers within the 'birthday bias' region, which makes sense considering the cultural dislike of this number. Its neighbour 14 is also unpopular, perhaps due to it being skipped across along with 13 when the casual selector scans across the board from left to right.  The most popular number is 7, with the second most popular being 3. This finding is aligned to common knowledge around the public's attraction to these numbers, within "choose a number between 1 and 10" questions for instance.  There is also a clear popularity trend for lower numbers ending with a 7, namely 7, 17 and 27.  I have future plans to run further analysis to show how the geometry of the selection board also affects the popularity of numbers. I will also look to study the popularity of combinations of numbers.  Until then, to play the opponent it would be best to choose the numbers which are indicated as being unpopular (those with smaller columns in the graphic), to minimise the chance of another player having the same numbers. By publishing this analysis however, the effectiveness of the combination 32, 34, 39, 40, 46 and 48 has now been reduced! I would therefore suggest only dipping into this combination to avoid sharing a possible jackpot with the readership of the Understanding Uncertainty blog!

Can you post the numeric values for your analysis results?  I've already written a program to generate random numbers with weighted probabilities, but I'm currently using p(1-12) = 0; p(13-31) = 0.01; p(32-49)=0.045 (i.e. a simple avoidance of birthday numbers).  Also, do you have a similar analysis for the EuroLottery? Do our european neighbours have the same liking as us for 3,4, 7,12, 17, 27, etc?

I could post them but it would be good to see if someone repeating the method gets the same numbers! As for the EuroMillions, I have run the analysis but there's a bit more complexity in that one to deal with. For instance, a jackpot is matching all 5 numbers drawn from the main 50 and then the 2 numbers drawn from the Lucky Stars. So a jackpot win in this game incorporates conscious selection across two selection boards! Also, the Lucky Star selection board changed on May 10th 2011 with the number of possible balls increasing from 9 to 11. I've run the analysis on the pre-May 10th 2011 results, and get interpretable output for the Lucky Star selection board but not so much on the main selection board. I'm chalking this up to statistical noise due to the small sample size, but I need to look into it more.

I've been running my numbers for a few years now, and keep having to check that my Direct Debit is still active such is my lack of success! I've added in a bit of randomness to one of my numbers, given that choosing your numbers by analysing the data is itself a form of conscious selection which could mean increasing your risk of sharing the prize with another number cruncher.

If there are a large number of prize winners in a given tier, then the prize amount distributed to each winning ticket will be lower. If there are fewer winning tickets, the value of the prize will increase accordingly.
