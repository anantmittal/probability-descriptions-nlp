The first group of players bets even when the odds are not in their favor. The second group of players profits from the cash left behind by the first group. You want to belong to the
    second group.  Knowing your odds well is a key discipline one must possess to consistently win
        at poker. The poker odds chart below shows the probabilities of obtaining various
        winning hands  in Texas Hold'em Poker.  "Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much

Gambling led to the development of probability theory in the late 1400s. When playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli released his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Paccioli’s work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae , discussed the concepts of probability and how they directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any recognition because it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de Méré, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De Méré tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascal’s work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling. [1]  [2]  Frequency of 5-card poker hands [ edit ]     A Venn diagram depicting poker hands and their odds from a typical American 9/6 Jacks or Better machine    The following chart enumerates the (absolute) frequency of each hand, given all combinations of 5 cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement. Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:   Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits.  Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, including the same card values in different suits.  The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand ( Frequency ) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space ;             (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle \,{\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   ). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is 4 / 2,598,960 , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, that's nearly 0.000154% of the time.  Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as or better than the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand at least as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand's probability with the probabilities of all hands above it.  The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways not to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else (2,598,960 - 4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956 : 4, or 649,739 : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as (1/p) - 1 : 1 , where p is the aforementioned probability.  The values given for Probability , Cumulative probability , and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.   The nCr function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering nCr with 52 and 5 , for example, yields            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   as above.

It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739 : 1.  When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.  Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ is identical to 3♦ 7♦ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.  The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ and 3♦ 7♣ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only two—that difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.  Frequency of 7-card poker hands [ edit ]  In some popular variations of poker, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   . It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is less than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.  The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).      Hand  Frequency  Probability  Cumulative  Odds    Royal flush  4,324  0.0032%  0.0032%  30,939 : 1    Straight flush (excl. royal flush)  37,260  0.0279%  0.0311%  3,589.6 : 1    Four of a kind  224,848  0.168%  0.199%  594 : 1    Full house  3,473,184  2.60%  2.80%  37.5 : 1    Flush  4,047,644  3.03%  5.82%  32.1 : 1    Straight  6,180,020  4.62%  10.4%  20.6 : 1    Three of a kind  6,461,620  4.83%  15.3%  19.7 : 1    Two pair  31,433,400  23.5%  38.8%  3.26 : 1    One pair  58,627,800  43.8%  82.6%  1.28 : 1    No pair  23,294,460  17.4%  100%  4.74 : 1    Total  133,784,560  100%  100%  0 : 1      (The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)  Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.  The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards because some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high).  Frequency of 5-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  Some variants of poker, called lowball , use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel .

Frequency of 7-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  In some variants of poker a player uses the best five-card low hand selected from seven cards. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel . The probability is calculated based on            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   , the total number of 7-card combinations.  The table does not extend to include five-card hands with at least one pair. Its "Total" represents 95.4% of the time that a player can select a 5-card low hand without any pair.

Rick from Gardnerville, USA   Assuming you draw five cards, and count all hands with exactly two jacks, then the probability would be combin(4,2)*combin(48,3)/combin(52,5) = 6*17296/2598960 = 3.99%.     Thank goodness I just discovered your great site. I have been trying to solve the following, and keep getting different answers. If I am dealt a pocket pair (in Hold'em) what are my chances of getting either three of a kind, or four of a kind on the flop (next three cards).  Elliot from Harwich, Massachusetts   For probability questions, I like to take the number of combinations the event you're interested can happen divided by the total number of combinations. First review the combin function in my probabilities in poker section. The number of ways to get a four of a kind is simply the number of singletons in the deck, or 48. The number of ways to get a three of a kind (not including a full house) is the product of the number of ways to get the third card, 2, and the number of ways to get two other singletons, 2*combin(12,2)*4 2 = 2,112. The total number of ways the cards can come up in the flop are combin(50,3)=19,600. So, the probability of a four of a kind is 48/19600=0.0024, and the probability of a three of a kind is 2,112/19,600=0.1078.     In hold em poker, what are the odds of being dealt pocket aces? And what are the odds of being dealt pocket aces twice in a row?  Adam from Redding, USA   There are 52*51/2 = 1326 ways to arrange 2 cards out of 52. There are 4*3/2=6 ways to arrange 2 aces out of 4. So the answer is 6/1326 = 1/221. The probability of this happening twice in a row is (1/221) 2 = 1 in 48,841.     If ten people are each dealt two cards from a single deck what is the probability that two players will get a pair of aces?  Anonymous   First, there are 10*9/2=45 ways you can choose 2 players out of 10. The probability of two specific players getting four aces is 1/combin(52,4)=1/270725. So the probability of any two players getting a pair of aces is 45/270725=0.0001662.     In a 10-handed game of Texas Hold 'em, and the flop is three different ranks, what is the probability that three players have a set?  Anonymous   For those unfamiliar with the terminology, each player gets two cards to himself and the three flop cards are shared among all players. So this is the same as asking if you dealt three community cards, all of different ranks, and ten 2-card hands, what is the probability three of the 2-card hands would be pairs that match one of the three community cards.  The probability player 1 has a set is 3* combin (3,2)/combin(49,2). Then the probability player 2 has a set is 2*combin(3,2)/combin(47,2). Then the probability player 3 has a set is combin(3,2)/combin(45,2). However, any three players can the three sets, not necessarily the first three. There are combin(10,3) ways to choose the 3 players out of 10 that have sets. So the answer is combin(10,3)*(3*combin(3,2)/combin(49,2))*(2*combin(3,2)/combin(47,2))*(combin(3,2)/combin(45,2)) = 0.00000154464 = 1 in 64,740.     Hi - Thank you for your web site. I'm wondering if you can tell me what are the odds if you are dealt Q-Q that any of the remaining 8 people at the table would be dealt A-A, A-K, K-K, or A-Q? Thank you!  Anonymous   For any given person the probability of having AA is combin (4,2)/combin(50,2) = 6/1,225 = 0.0049 because there are 6 ways to pick 2 aces out of 4, and 1225 ways to pick any 2 cards out of the 50 left in the deck. The probability is the same for a pair of kings. For A-K the probability is 4*4/1,225=0.0131, because there are 4 ways to get an ace and 4 ways to get a king. For A-Q the probability is 4*2/1225=0.0065, because there are 4 aces but only 2 queens left in the deck. So the probability any given player will have one of these hands is (6+6+16+8)/1225 = 0.0294. Now the next step is clearly not perfect because if one player doesn't have one of these hands the odds the next player does is a little bit higher. Forgetting this for the sake of simplicity the probability no player has one of these hands is (1-0.0294) 8 = 78.77%. So the probability at least one player has one of these hands is 21.23%.     In Texas hold em, if two players are dealt a pocket pair pre-flop, what are the odds of each of these players flopping a set(three of a kind)?  Bob from Cincinnati   Let’s assume you have a pair of aces.  Before considering that the other player has another pair the probability of flopping a three of a kind is the [nc(one ace)*nc(two ranks out of 12)*nc(one suit out of 4) 2 + nc(any other three of a kind)]/nc(any three cards), where nc(x) = number of combinations of x.  This equals [2* combin (12,2)*4 2 +12*combin(4,3)]/combin(50,3) = (2112+48)/19600 = 11.020%.  Now lets assume the other player has any other pair, but not the same as yours.  Then probability becomes [2*(combin(11,2)*4 2 + 11*2*4 + 11*combin(4,3)]/combin(48,3) = 11.4477%.     What are the chances in a heads up game of Texas Hold’em that each player gets KK. Then on the very next hand both players get KK. We can’t even get a close estimate. If you can figure it out please respond, thanks.  Anonymous   The probability for any given hand is ( combin (4,2)/combin(52,2))*(1/combin(50,2)) = 1/270725.  So, the probability of this happening twice in a row is 1 in 270,725 2 = 1 in 73,292,025,625.     What are the odds of a pair showing on the board on the flop in Holdem ? ie., A A 10 or 5 Q 5, etc.  Stephen from Addison   13*12* combin (4,2)*4/combin(52,3) = 3744/22100 = 16.941%.     Thanks for the help your site has given. You’ve probably saved me thousands.   I was playing in a NL Texas Hold 'em tournament on-line recently, and was dealt pocket kings (at a 10-man table) only to be dominated by pocket aces. I'd like to know the probability, given the condition that you have a pair, of at least one other player at the 10-man table having a higher pair than yours (in other words, having a "dominated pair"). Thanks again!  Dan from Cairo, Egypt   The following table shows estimated probabilities that a pair will be beaten by at least one higher pair according to the number of players (including yourself).  These probabilities are not exact because the hands are not independent.  However to find the exact probabilities would get complicated and I think these are pretty close.  My formula is 1-(1-r* combin (4,2)/combin(50,2)) (n-1) , where r=number of higher ranks than your pair, and n = total number of players.  The table shows the probability of another player having a pair of aces, when you have a pair of kings, in a 10-player game, to be 4.323%.

Chris from Hampton   Let's call the players A, B, and C.  The probability A has a pair of aces is combin (4,2)/combin(52,2) = 6/1326. The probability B has a pair of kings is combin(4,2)/combin(50,2) = 6/1225. The probability C has a pair of queens is combin(4,2)/combin(48,2) = 6/1128.  However there are 3! = 1*2*3 = 6 ways you can arrange three pairs between three players.  So, the answer is 6*(6/1326)*(6/1225)*(6/1128) = 0.000000707321.     I’ve been a huge fan for many years (even before you got interested in poker and sports betting) and looked forward to every Ask The Wizard column. It’s great to see you’re doing them again!  My question is this: at my local card room, they offer Aces Cracked, Win A Rack during certain hours. That is, if you have pocket Aces in one of their 3-6 or 4-8 Texas Hold ’Em games and you lose the pot, the casino will give you a rack of chips ($100). I’m trying to figure out how often a)I get pocket Aces b)how often they would lose if I played them aggressively as I’m supposed to and c)whether it’s not better to just check all the way down and hope to lose, as $100 is usually better than what the pot would have been anyway.  Any stats you may have at the ready would be wonderful and forever appreciated!  Thanks again and keep up enlightening the masses!  Shane from Santa Rosa   Thanks for the kind words.  The probability you will get pocket aces in any one hand is 6/1326, or once every 221 hands.  According to my 10-player Texas Hold ’em section (/games/texas-hold-em/10players.html) the probability of winning with pocket aces is 31.36%, assuming all players stay in until the end.  However that is a big if.  If forced to make a guess I’d estimate the probability of winning with aces in a real 10-player game is about 70%.  So the probability of getting pocket aces and then losing is 0.3*(1/221) = 0.1357%.  So, at $100 per incident that is worth 13.57 cents per hand.  Over ten people that costs the poker room $1.36 per hand on average, which cuts into the rake quite a bit.  I tend to agree with your strategy of calling, which will keep more players in the hand, and increase your chance of losing.     What are the odds of having pocket aces and pocket kings both being dealt in the same hand?  Jake from Loveland, CO   The odds of a specific player having aces is combin (4,2)/combin(52,2) = 6/1326.  The odds of the next player having a pair of kings is combin(4,2)/combin(50,2) = 6/1225.  However, in a ten-player game there are 10 possible players who could get the aces, and 9 possible players for the kings.  So a strong approximation would be 10*9*(6/1326)*(6/1225) = 0.001995, or 1 in 501.  This answer is slightly too high, because it double counts the situation where two players have aces, or two have kings, or both.     Hello, thank you for a very interesting and informative site. I have a question of my own that I hope you can answer for me. As a Texas hold 'em player, I pay special attention to pocket pairs, and have particular interest towards 10-10 or J-J or similar, as on the surface they appear strong but can be beaten easily.  My question however, is how do you work out the probability of there being at least one person on your table holding a higher pocket pair to yours?  Andrew from St. Albans   The math of this gets very messy due to the possibility of more than one playing having a higher pair, including the same type of pair.  For example if you have pocket kings two players could have pocket aces.  However it is easy to show the expected number of players who will beat you.  This would be n*r*(6/1225), where n is the number of opponents, and r is the number of higher ranks.  The following table shows the average number of players who will have a higher pocket pair according to your pocket pair (left column) by the number of opponents (top row).

Given that assumption the probability that at least one player will beat you is 1-e -µ , where µ is the mean.  For examle if you have pocket queens and there are 9 other players the expected number of players with a higher pocket pair is 0.0882, so the probability of at least one player having a higher pocket pair is 1-e -0.0882 = 8.44%.  The table below shows those probabilities.

I have tried to work it out using a probability tree but my answer seems too high. Also on the net I have read different answers some suggesting it is around 1/3 or 2/5 or 1/2. What is the probability of at least pairing and is it possible to work this out using a probability tree? Your help will be much appreciated thanks.  Nathan S. from New Plymouth   For those not familiar with the hold 'em terminology, you are asking for the probability of at least a pair in six cards, given that the first two are (the hole cards) of different ranks.  I hope you'll forgive me if I just do the probability of getting exactly a pair, including hands that also form a straight or flush.  The number of ways to pair one of your hole cards is six (2 hole cards * 3 suits remaining).  The other three cards must all be of different ranks from the 11 left.  There are combin (11,3)=165 ways to choose 3 ranks out of 11.  For each of these there are four suits to choose from.  So the number of ways to pair one of your hole cards is 6*165*4 3 =63,360.  Now let's look at the number of ways to get a pair outside of the two hole cards.  There are 11 ranks to choose from for the pair.  Once the pair is chosen there are combin(4,2)=6 ways to choose 2 suits out of 4.  For the other two cards there are combin(10,2)=45 ways to choose 2 ranks out of the 10 fully intact ranks left.  For both of those ranks there are 4 possible suits.  So the total combinations for a pair, not including the hole cards, is 11*6*45*4 2 =47,520. The total number of ways to choose 4 cards out of the 50 left in the deck is combin(50,4)=230,300.  So the probability of getting exactly a pair in six cards is (63,360+47,520)/230,300 = 48.15%.     Last night I played a hand where three players all hit sets on the flop.  Luckily for me I had AA against QQ and 22.  What is the probability that three players hit sets on the flop?  Cheers  Gareth H. from Auckland, NZ   The probability of three different ranks in the flop is combin (13,3)×4 3 /combin(52,3) = 0.828235.  There are combin(10,3)=120 ways you can choose three players out of ten.  Of the three, the probability the first will have a set is 3×combin(3,2)/combin(49,2) = 0.007653061.  The probability the second will have a set is 2×combin(3,2)/combin(47,2) = 0.005550416. The probability the third will have a set is combin(3,2)/combin(45,2) = 0.003030303.  Take the product of all this and the probability is  0.828235 × 120 × 0.007653061 × 0.005550416 × 0.003030303 = 0.00001279, or 1 in 78,166.     In 55,088 hands of poker I had a pair going into the flop 2,787 times.  Of those 2,787 I hit a set 273 times.  How does that square with expectations?  Linus from Alings&aring;s, Sweden   For readers who may not know, a "set" is a three of a kind after the flop, including a pocket pair.  The probability of not making a set is (48+combin(48,3))/combin(50,3) = 17,344/19600 = 88.49%.  So the probability of making a set is 11.51%.  In 2,787 pairs you should have made a set 320.8 times.  So you are 47.8 sets under expectations.  The variance is n × p × (1-p), where n = number of hands, and p = probability of making the set.  In this case the variance is 2,787 × .1176 × .8824 = 283.86.  The standard deviation is the square root of that, or 16.85.  So you are 47.8/16.85 = 2.84 standard deviations south of expectations.  The probability of luck this bad or worse can be found in any Standard Normal table, or in Excel as norsdist(-2.84) = 0.002256, or 1 in 443.     I feel I was cheated in a poker game. According to my math,  AA vs. KK will happen once every 45,000 hands heads up, but it happened to me 3 times in 400 hands.  Is this unlikely enough to suspect something?  Rafael   The probability of being on the losing end of KK vs. AA is  ( combin (4,2)/combin(52,2)) × (combin(4,2)/combin(50,2)) = 0.000022162, for each opponent at the table.  That is once every 45,121 hands, so your math was right.  The expected number of times that would happen in 400 hands is 400 × 0.000022162 = 0.008865084, per opponent.  The following table shows the probability of 3 or more instances of having KK against AA in 400 hands, by the number of opponents.   3+ KK vs AA probability in 400 hands    Opponents  Probability  Inverse   1  0.0000001145  1 in 8,734,376   2  0.0000009133  1 in 1,094,949   3  0.0000030658  1 in 326,182   4  0.0000072234  1 in 138,438   5  0.0000140202  1 in 71,325   6  0.0000240728  1 in 41,541   7  0.000037981  1 in 26,329   8  0.0000563277  1 in 17,753   9  0.0000796798  1 in 12,550    So, yes, I would say this looks fishy.  The fewer the players, the more fishy it looks.  I would be interested to know where this game was.  Great Site!!  If I have pocket Queens, what is the chance that an Ace or King will come by the river?  A simple fundamental question, but one that will help me tremendously.  Ed Miller from Banning CA   Thanks.  There are 50 cards left in the deck, and 42 of them are not aces or kings.  The probability of not seeing any aces or kings in five community cards is combin (42,5)/combin(50,5) = 850,668/2,118,760=40.15%.  So, the probability of seeing at least one ace or king is 100% - 40.15% = 59.85%.    This happened to me this week, and am eagerly curious as to the statistic.  Over two nights, I held Pocket Aces 3 times in total, and all 3 times I had them there was another player on the table of 10 players also with Pocket Aces.  I have not been able to find the probability of this happening anywhere and I hope you can shed some light on this. On a full table of 10 players, what is the chance of this happening?  Rob T. from Hong Kong   The probability of a specific other player having pocket aces, given that you do, is (2/50)×(1/49) = 1 in 1,225.  Given 9 other players, the probability is 9 times that, or 1 in 136.  This might seem like an abuse of taking the sum of probabilities.  However, it is okay if only one player can get the two aces.  To answer your question, the probability that another player had pockets aces three out of the three times you had pockets aces is  (9×(2/50)×(1/49)) 3 = 1 in 2,521,626.

Hi everyone,   I'm looking for the specific odds of making quads with a pocket pair by the river. If you ran out all the community cards.  Also, odds of making quads on the flop. Thank you.                                      #2     12th May 2016, 7:17 AM             Shaetano [84]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Holdem              Hey, here you go  Draw Probabilities for obtaining quads with pocket pair hole cards Complete on Flop: 0.245% Complete on Turn: 2.128% Complete on River: 2.174%                                   #3     12th May 2016, 7:26 AM              Aaron Soto [250]         Poker at: Bovada  Game: NL HOLDEM              Okay, so basically, your saying its about 1 in 50 I make quads by the turn? With a pocket pair? That can't be right.....I need the 1/10 type not percents. 0.245% on flop equates to about what? 1 in 400 which actually, seems correct. I can't see that by adding one more card (the turn) it becomes 1 in 50 no way.....                                   #4     12th May 2016, 9:24 AM           Excomm [30]         Online Poker at: BOL / ACR  Game: NLHE              It may be surprising, but that is the probability of drawing to 1 out on the turn (46:1) and the river (45:1).  It is the same probability of completing a straight flush draw as well.  The probabilities that Shaetano posted above are correct.  Think of it this way.  To make quads...  On the flop you are trying to draw 2 cards out of 50 and then 1 card out of 49 OR 2 cards out of 50 and then 1 card out of 48 OR 2 cards out of 49 and then 1 card out of 48.  On the Turn you are trying to draw just 1 card out of 47 (not that hard).  On the River you are trying to draw 1 card out of 46 (only a little worse than trying to get a powerball match  )                                   #5     12th May 2016, 9:46 AM              TimovieMan [2,264]         Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Texas Holdem                   Originally Posted by Aaron Soto   I need the 1/10 type not percents.

Incorrect.  I hope my wording will be clear.  You subtract 1 from the 408.1633 to get the accurate number. It happens once in 408 hands, so the odds of it happening are 407:1.  Odds of 25% are 3:1, not 4:1 (as that would be 20%). It'll happen 25% of the time, or once in 4, but the odds are 3:1.   So it's ((100 / odds %) - 1 ) : 1.                                   #9     12th May 2016, 4:31 PM              SuzdalDEcor [511]                          Originally Posted by TimovieMan   Because converting is hard?

And the River probability is also misleading.        Fair enough.  It's true that the odds of making quads only improve significantly if you flop a set.  These are the odds of getting quads (when dealt a pocket pair) (or a straight flush with two suited and connected cards) WITHOUT assuming that you flopped a set.  *edit* Note that the odds for the turn include quads made on the flop, and the odds for the river include quads made on the flop and the turn.  Later today if I have time I'll figure out the odds of making these hands EXACTLY on the turn and river.  on Flop:  0.145 (407.33:1) by Turn:  0.490 (203.17:1) by River: 0.816 (121.50:1)  My bad for misinterpreting the original question.                                   #14     13th May 2016, 10:01 PM              Dutchtegon [155]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: holdem              Its nice to know such little facts, but I guess you are not going to play for those kind of things. When playing on pokerstars there are people wo do, and in general you can take their money without any problem, but when you lose from them the rage is to big to describe.                                   #15     13th May 2016, 10:25 PM           Excomm [30]         Poker at: BOL / ACR  Game: NLHE              I made a typo in my last response so I'll post the odds again here (sorry for the confusion)  on Flop  0.245 (407.33:1) (changed from the 0.145 typo) by Turn  0.490 (203.17:1) by River 0.816 (121.50:1)  If we subtract the quads made on previous streets then we will get the odds of hitting quads EXACTLY on those streets.  on Flop  0.245 (407.33:1) on Turn  0.245 (407.33:1) on River 0.327 (305.25:1)                                   #16     13th May 2016, 11:02 PM           shmucky [3]                     side note.       funny you bring this up. I just saw quad fours on the flop busted by a straight flush on the river. it was free roll on sports betting but painful to see lol                                  #17     27th December 2017, 10:23 AM             Mikeisanace777 [84]                     All the other answers are based on false Data mostly..       These odds are based on similar video poker data not real live poker ,or even online .The reason for this is sometimes,or a lot of times you have 0% whereas video poker it's always the same there are no hole cards and no burn cards which influence the unknown variables of quads and all hands in holdem poker by a lot!! Sometimes to hit the quads the card you need is burned,or usually folded or in play therefore it's not predictable at all. Same goes for a set it may be 1/8 chance to flop it or sometimes based on a 9 ring game and 3 burn cards could be 0% it's always fluctuates and this goes for flush draws,and all draws. In fact if you knew the remaining 31 cards in the deck vs other players hands you would always know what to do right? Say you got A/7 of spades in a limit game and you knew your up against KA off AQ off and jj but you somehow magically could see the remaining 31 cards and the burns then you would continue even after the flop. For instance say the flop came 9-A-8 with 2 spades vs the previous match ups I described in a good size pot,but you knew the remaining cards contained 3 sevens-2 aces and 2 eights, and to go with that the full match up of spades in the deck vs AK this is a huge beni factor for you as you got many cards to fill up,chop and 9 outs to flush out in your spade draw. Of course you never actually know this this is why Holdem poker is an incomplete data game there is no good cards in holdem especially limit holdem. As I said before you never know what could occur! Say you have kk vs 10-j and 67 with the remaining cards to be seen as 89-9 a load of 7's 10's and 2 fives all within that spectrum of the top of the deck,what makes matters worse even in the 31 random deck scenario vs these types of hands sometimes your kings aren't even in there and no running pairs to give you a counterfeit 2 pair either so your essentially dead in the water vs probable 2 pair flops like 8-10-4 -Q-5-10 etc.. It doesn't mean your one pair won't be gold it just means your hoping to hold up with no chance of improving. So to hit Quads on a flopped set of 99 all the stars have to line up right just the even have the true odds to make it in that scenario. Iv'e seen your previous posts and you enjoy 3/6 limit and play a lot you check on my post on advanced 3/6 theory gl man.

This was the most memorable hand last year during Summer... I want to hear insights and what I could've done better... Visited Macau with a buddy just for half a day... Buddy went to 2/5 (roughly that amount from HKD) and I'm was a beginner and still a beginner so I went to 1/2... bought in for about 400... Table was mainly Chinese Mainlanders who were either 1)extremely Loose Passive 2) extremely Tight Aggressive.... Mostly calling stations with huge bankrolls , just buying in again and again after making donkey calls.... So although it was a 1/2, most players had 1000+... Played for good two to three hours,  and about the beginning of the hand my stack went up to around 1000 USD... sitting right of the Cut-Off position, got dealt pocket 77.... My table image at that point was Loose Aggressive...  UTG raises to 12BB 24 USD... two mid-position callers, I also call aiming to set-mine, and cut-off and button calls, 6 callers pre-flop pot was 150USD.... Flop was 7h7d8h... At that point my hands just started to shake, partially from the cocaine I've been taking in the bathroom and the dopamine coming out from the joy of me paying out... UTG who was the initial raiser just checks and it gets checked down to me and I check to trap the table, wishing for a heart to show up... the whole table checks... the Turn is a Qh and UTG bets 100 USD, two mid-position folds and I hollywood for a bit and call, cut-off calls and button calls... Now the pot is 550 USD.... River is Jd... UTG bets 300, with 200 left behind him and I go all in with around 850, a pot sized all-in.... cut-off insta-folds and the button thinks for a while and calls and UTG calls... I insta-show the quads and they muck  their hands, I take down around 2k.... 1) So if you guys hit quads in this situation on the flop, would you guys just slow play trying to trap or add value to the 150 pot? 2) Also, would it be correct to range UTG as pocket QQ, making a full-house and the button suited hearts, making a flush? UTG was one of the TAGs who rarely played and button was a chinese girl who were one of the passive calling stations as I remember.... If I made a set instead on the flop, should I have raised to avoid the button making the flush?? 3) If you guys could rate it, was this hand played correctly or not?  Thanks.. and may the poker gods be with y'all  Also sorry for some lack of information... this was a live poker hand from macau last summer...                                      #2     11th February 2017, 4:16 AM           stokedog4 [158]         Online Poker at: pokerstars  Game: holdem              You played it well and I doubt you make more in that spot.

Flop came J47, I was SB check guy in MP goes all in, button calls.  I had the button covered and was like WTF, we all can't have sets.  So I push all in, button calls and sure enough we all had sets.  Only time I've ever seen it.  The odds of floping a set are not 1/8 it's 1/17 I believe.                                   #13     14th June 2009, 4:50 AM              cardplayer52 [1,195]         Online Poker at: full tilt  Game: holdem              ok my math could be off but i think i'm right. if you start w/3 different pairs preflop. the odds of all 3 hitting a set on the flop would be 2/46 x 2/45 x 2/44 = .0000878 too express that as odds you multiply by 100 then divide 100 by the result. which works out to be 11,390 to 1. but i looked at a chart of 1000 hands dealt to 10 players and it said 3+ pair were dealt 1.49%(this was 10handed but it also didnt say diferent pairs) of the time. using that number i figure it to be 764,430 to 1.                                   #14     14th June 2009, 9:38 AM           JulieK [118]                     re: Poker & Set over set over set, what are the odds?

You know in Hard Rock casino ... you would be celebrating because you would get something like !$200 000 -$300 000 bad beat jackpot. Last time i was there it was like 500k .If your Quads or better get beat you get half of the jackpot and the rest of the table gets to split the other half.  You have to have a pair in your hand and i believe Quads have to be higher than 4's or 5's ..something like that.

In this case, certainly one of the more rare happenings.  Can't recall ever seeing one, and don't think I would care to. What are the odds that 'I' would have the bottom set. HMmmm ... that wouldn't be so bad I guess if I could hit my quads on the river.  One step further, what are the odds that 2 of the sets could be quads by showdown, and which sets would they be?

I held 10's in the hole and was against AK. On the flop....K, 10, 10. Ok I check, call the big bet, actually called by another player. next card....K. Hmmm, I should slowplay anyway right? Call another big bet. River....K. Wow, now I'm just pretty amazed at that, I have to fold to his bet. However someone else actually called him down with A9....but it was SUITED so I can't blame him (hehe). Obviously he lost to the 4 K's, and no one believed me when I told them I folded quad 10's...they just laughed. I took a screen shot so I'll definitely post it sometime.                                   #11     9th April 2008, 2:04 AM           bustme [270]                     Wow,.,.Many other people who have lost with four of a kind before...........  One of the last hands I played in NL25 on pokerstars I got 10 10, one person raise preflop to 1 dollar 2 other guys called and me....

The odds that you'll get beat are long - very long.  If you play enough hands over enough years, it'll happen to you though.  More than once, if you play long enough.  Kyle is right too, you'll likely encounter it more in a game like Omaha or Stud.                                   #14     9th April 2008, 2:15 AM           jvtelemark [28]         Online Poker at: Nordic Bet  Game: Holdem              re: Poker & Is losing with four of a kind a once in a lifetime experience?

Depends how you have been playing before hands, a few weeks ago I had been limping in and chacking everytime I missed for awhile so the flop came 99 and something I can't remember, guy got pissed next to me, raised half his stack, I reraised all in and he called with A2.                                   #19     9th April 2008, 1:30 PM              Likminutz [851]         Game: NLHE                    Originally Posted by F Paulsson   Without even knowing exactly what happened, I can tell you that checking that flop is a significant leak.

Quads don't come around that often, but flopping monsters is not a rare occurrence. When the preflop action, as he described it, had "lots of action" then the idea of slowplaying the nuts on the flop in (what must be) a big pot is really bad.  For slowplaying to be right, the circumstances must be extraordinary. It's something that should be done very rarely. From the way he phrased it, it's clear to me that he thought of it as the default play, but even if specifically he doesn't, there's a ton of people who can't help themselves but to check when they flop monsters. And that IS a significant leak, no doubt. No matter what the situation is leading up to that hand.  As an aside, I've posted about this many times before, and with time I've become lazy and just post one-liners when I spot something that strikes me as a very basic beginner's mistake. I understand - and agree - that including reasoning makes the post more worthwhile, but I've noticed that I don't really have the energy to repeat the longer explanation posts unless specifically asked for it (like here).  I make one-line posts in two situations; one is where I simply don't have time to post more at that precise moment, and the other is where I find the reasoning to be standard and/or obvious. My previous post was the latter.                                   #22     9th April 2008, 6:28 PM           blindin1eye [20]         Online Poker at: ultimate bet  Game: holdem              i feel your pain twice last week had 4 9'S LOST TO THE STRAIT FLUSH BYE BYE $400                                   #23     10th April 2008, 6:15 PM              Likminutz [851]         Game: NLHE                    Originally Posted by F Paulsson   Quads don't come around that often, but flopping monsters is not a rare occurrence.

My previous post was the latter.         You contradict yourself, we were only talking about quads in one hand not all different "nuts."  You say slowplaying should be done very rarely...well quads are pretty rare.  I would say even if he bets out on this hand the outcome probably doesnt differ that much...although I agree with you as I now am aware that there was "lots" of preflop action, betting out is definitely the better move.  I just think he's still ending up broke however he plays this hand post flop.  Thanks for you insight though, hope I didn't piss you off for asking for an explanation.                                   #24     10th April 2008, 9:13 PM              F Paulsson [5,654]                           Originally Posted by Likminutz   You contradict yourself         No, I don't think I am. I'm possibly contradicting what you thought I meant.       You say slowplaying should be done very rarely...well quads are pretty rare.        Well, yes, but... I think you may have misunderstood me. I don't mean that slowplaying is something you should do "rarely" for the sake of doing it not often. Slowplaying should be done rarely because the conditions in which it is correct occurs so rarely. Having a monster is only one condition that needs to be met. The pot also needs to be small, your opponents need to be likely to fold if you bet, AND they need to have some reasonable chance to improve if you check. As in, you don't slowplay rarely just to make it a rare occurence, you slowplay rarely because the appropriate situation in which to slowplay presents itself so very rarely.

I just think he's still ending up broke however he plays this hand post flop.        Ah, yes. This I agree with completely. In fact, if he somehow manages to NOT get his whole stack in on this board, THAT shows a VERY significant leak.       Thanks for you insight though, hope I didn't piss you off for asking for an explanation.        Not at all. I'm not one to get easily pissed off, and as I said, I don't mind adding reasoning to my opinions if someone asks for it. Often, I don't need to explain myself, but when I do, I'm happy that someone calls me on it. Never be afraid to request that someone explains why they think something.

See All Sportsbook Reviews You are here Home » Four of a Kind Odds  Four of a Kind Odds  Facebook Twitter Reddit Getting four of a kind in Texas Hold’em won’t happen to you very often. You have roughly a 1 in 4,100 chance to hit this monster hand on the flop, but this big hand isn’t always the best way to get chips from your opponents. Hitting four of a kind means that the only hand in poker that can beat you is a straight flush. The odds of being up against a straight flush when you’ve hit four of a kind are over 1 in 88 million, and it’s unlikely that you’ll even see this happen — let alone be involved in a hand where it does occur. Just because you hit a big hand like four of a kind doesn’t mean that you’re going to win a big pot. In order for you to have four of a kind, there has to be at least two of your cards on the board, and more often there will be three of them with the community cards. Because you have all four of them, your opponents’ hands are going to be inferior, and when you have a big hand against a bunch of weak hands, it’s hard to get chips out of your opponents. They will see the likelihood of you having a big hand and will often get out of the way. The best way to play a monster hand like four of a kind is to let your opponents catch up a bit. You do this by not betting your big hand. That lets the other players in the hand improve and it makes them think that you don’t have very much, especially a monster like four of a kind. You want to induce the other players at the table to make a bet at the pot. If someone does, you should only call their bets, and only raise the action after the last card has been dealt out. That will give you the best chance to get paid on your four of a kind, otherwise your monster hand will be wasted and all you will win will be a small pot.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.    A full house from two pair on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your boat.    A flush from a four-flush on the next card = 4.22-to-1 (19.15%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards left of your suit to hit your flush.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw on the next card = 4.9-to-1 (17.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards left to hit your straight.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.8-to-1 (12.77%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 6 cards to hit your pair.    Flop to river     A full house or better from a set by the river = 1.99-to-1 (33.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((40/47)*(36/46))  EXPLANATION: There are 10 cards on the turn that will make you a full house. Assuming that you don't hit it on the turn, the turn card will add 3 more cards for you to hit your boat on the river.    A full house or better from two pair by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.5%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have four outs to hit your full house on either the turn on river.    A flush from a four-flush by the river = 1.86-to-1 (35.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((38/47)*(37/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one of the 9 flush cards either on the turn OR the river.    A backdoor flush by the river = 23.02-to-1 (4.16%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(10/47)*(9/46)  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 10 flush cards on the turn and hit one out of the 9 flush cards on the river.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw by the river = 2.18-to-1 (31.45%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((39/47)*(38/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 8 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.47%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 4 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A pair or better from two overcards by the river = 3.14-to-1 (24.14%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((41/47)*(40/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 6 cards that can make you a pair either on the turn or the river.    The river     A full house or better from a set = 3.6-to-1 (21.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/10)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 different cards to hit your boat and 1 card to hit quads.    A full house from two pair on the final card = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left that match your two pair.    A flush from a four-flush on the final card = 4.11-to-1 (19.6%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards to hit your pair.    An open-ended straight draw = 4.75-to-1 (17.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.    A gutshot straight draw = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.67-to-1 (13.0%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.    A full house from two pair on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your boat.    A flush from a four-flush on the next card = 4.22-to-1 (19.15%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards left of your suit to hit your flush.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw on the next card = 4.9-to-1 (17.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards left to hit your straight.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.8-to-1 (12.77%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 6 cards to hit your pair.    Flop to river     A full house or better from a set by the river = 1.99-to-1 (33.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((40/47)*(36/46))  EXPLANATION: There are 10 cards on the turn that will make you a full house. Assuming that you don't hit it on the turn, the turn card will add 3 more cards for you to hit your boat on the river.    A full house or better from two pair by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.5%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have four outs to hit your full house on either the turn on river.    A flush from a four-flush by the river = 1.86-to-1 (35.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((38/47)*(37/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one of the 9 flush cards either on the turn OR the river.    A backdoor flush by the river = 23.02-to-1 (4.16%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(10/47)*(9/46)  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 10 flush cards on the turn and hit one out of the 9 flush cards on the river.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw by the river = 2.18-to-1 (31.45%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((39/47)*(38/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 8 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.47%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 4 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A pair or better from two overcards by the river = 3.14-to-1 (24.14%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((41/47)*(40/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 6 cards that can make you a pair either on the turn or the river.    The river     A full house or better from a set = 3.6-to-1 (21.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/10)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 different cards to hit your boat and 1 card to hit quads.    A full house from two pair on the final card = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left that match your two pair.    A flush from a four-flush on the final card = 4.11-to-1 (19.6%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards to hit your pair.    An open-ended straight draw = 4.75-to-1 (17.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.    A full house from two pair on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your boat.    A flush from a four-flush on the next card = 4.22-to-1 (19.15%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards left of your suit to hit your flush.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw on the next card = 4.9-to-1 (17.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards left to hit your straight.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.8-to-1 (12.77%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 6 cards to hit your pair.    Flop to river     A full house or better from a set by the river = 1.99-to-1 (33.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((40/47)*(36/46))  EXPLANATION: There are 10 cards on the turn that will make you a full house. Assuming that you don't hit it on the turn, the turn card will add 3 more cards for you to hit your boat on the river.    A full house or better from two pair by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.5%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have four outs to hit your full house on either the turn on river.    A flush from a four-flush by the river = 1.86-to-1 (35.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((38/47)*(37/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one of the 9 flush cards either on the turn OR the river.    A backdoor flush by the river = 23.02-to-1 (4.16%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(10/47)*(9/46)  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 10 flush cards on the turn and hit one out of the 9 flush cards on the river.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw by the river = 2.18-to-1 (31.45%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((39/47)*(38/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 8 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.47%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 4 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A pair or better from two overcards by the river = 3.14-to-1 (24.14%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((41/47)*(40/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 6 cards that can make you a pair either on the turn or the river.    The river     A full house or better from a set = 3.6-to-1 (21.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/10)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 different cards to hit your boat and 1 card to hit quads.    A full house from two pair on the final card = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left that match your two pair.    A flush from a four-flush on the final card = 4.11-to-1 (19.6%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards to hit your pair.    An open-ended straight draw = 4.75-to-1 (17.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.    A gutshot straight draw = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.67-to-1 (13.0%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.    A full house from two pair on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your boat.    A flush from a four-flush on the next card = 4.22-to-1 (19.15%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards left of your suit to hit your flush.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw on the next card = 4.9-to-1 (17.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards left to hit your straight.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.8-to-1 (12.77%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 6 cards to hit your pair.    Flop to river     A full house or better from a set by the river = 1.99-to-1 (33.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((40/47)*(36/46))  EXPLANATION: There are 10 cards on the turn that will make you a full house. Assuming that you don't hit it on the turn, the turn card will add 3 more cards for you to hit your boat on the river.    A full house or better from two pair by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.5%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have four outs to hit your full house on either the turn on river.    A flush from a four-flush by the river = 1.86-to-1 (35.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((38/47)*(37/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one of the 9 flush cards either on the turn OR the river.    A backdoor flush by the river = 23.02-to-1 (4.16%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(10/47)*(9/46)  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 10 flush cards on the turn and hit one out of the 9 flush cards on the river.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw by the river = 2.18-to-1 (31.45%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((39/47)*(38/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 8 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.47%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 4 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A pair or better from two overcards by the river = 3.14-to-1 (24.14%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((41/47)*(40/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 6 cards that can make you a pair either on the turn or the river.    The river     A full house or better from a set = 3.6-to-1 (21.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/10)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 different cards to hit your boat and 1 card to hit quads.    A full house from two pair on the final card = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left that match your two pair.    A flush from a four-flush on the final card = 4.11-to-1 (19.6%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards to hit your pair.    An open-ended straight draw = 4.75-to-1 (17.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.    A gutshot straight draw = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.67-to-1 (13.0%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

Fri Jan 28, 2005, 02:58 AM       I was recently playing in a cash game. (9 handed game) I had ace/9 offsuit on the button. The flop came down ace,ace,ace. My next hand on the button I had 6/7 suited flop came down 6,6,6. Now I know the odds of flopping quads with one in the hole is .01%. I was trying to figure out the odds of it happening twice in 9 hands. I am not sure how to calculate it in percentage and or odds such as 8900 to 1 4000 to 2. Can anyone help me figure this out and if so please explain how to calculate.  Thanks          Tags:  None                    Previous  Next                         Working...

First, both players have to have a pocket pair for this to happen.  Let's call that XX and YY.   In order to get quads and FH the flop has to be XXY or YYX.  The chance of either is the same so we can find the chance of one and double it.  There are 2 possible Xs out of 48 cards for the first card then 1 possible X out of 47 then 2 possibly Ys out of 46  So the chance for hitting XXY should be 2/48 * 1/47 * 2/46 = 1/25944  But as I mentioned there are 2 different ways for this to happen, so that would be 1/12972                    RustyBrooks   View Public Profile  Send a private message to RustyBrooks  Find More Posts by RustyBrooks  Find Threads Started by RustyBrooks                     02-21-2013, 04:02 PM   # 3       sixhigh    ϡ       Join Date: Oct 2005  Posts: 2,259         Re: Odds of flopping a full house vs quads      You cannot just multiply the odds as those are not independent events.  If two players hold a pocket pair, for example Jc Jd vs. Qc Qd there are 4 flops which give one player a full house and the other player quads: Js Jh Qh; Js Jh Qs, Js Qh Qs, Jh Qh Qs.  In total there are choose(48;3) = 17296 flops possible.  Thus the probability of one player hitting quads and the other hitting a boat given both players start with a pocket pair is 4 / 17296 = 1 / 4324 = 0.023%.      Quote:    So the chance for hitting XXY should be 2/48 * 1/47 * 2/46 = 1/25944    You have to multiply that with 3! = 6 because the order of the cards on the flop does not matter.  Or, in other words, there are not 2 different ways for this to happen, but 6: XXY, XYX, YXX, YYX, YXY, XYY.

My way finds the chance of XXY happening but it could actually be XXY XYX YXX so I was off by a factor of 3.  Factoring that in, I get 6/25944 which is 1/4324                    RustyBrooks   View Public Profile  Send a private message to RustyBrooks  Find More Posts by RustyBrooks  Find Threads Started by RustyBrooks                     02-21-2013, 04:17 PM   # 5       camz2895    Carpal \'Tunnel    Join Date: Apr 2006  Location: Lafayette, LA  Posts: 7,246        So you should expect to see this occurrence in every 4300 hands or every 4300 pocket pairs you are dealt?                    camz2895   View Public Profile  Send a private message to camz2895  Find More Posts by camz2895  Find Threads Started by camz2895                     02-21-2013, 04:31 PM   # 6       RustyBrooks    Carpal \'Tunnel       Join Date: Feb 2006  Location: Austin, TX  Posts: 23,428         Re: Odds of flopping a full house vs quads        Quote:     Originally Posted by camz2895    So you should expect to see this occurrence in every 4300 hands or every 4300 pocket pairs you are dealt?

For specifically you getting the full house and the other guy getting quads, it's 1 in 8648 which is just 2/C(48,3).

Multiplying was fine for the probability of XXY even though the cards are not independent since he's multiplying conditional probabilities.  P(XXY) = P(X)*P(X|X)*P(Y|XX)  2/48 * 1/47 * 2/46.  He just has to multiply that by 3 since there are 3 mutually exclusive outcomes with this probability (XXY,XYX, YXX).  That gives the probability that specifically you flop the full house while the other player flops quads.      Last edited by BruceZ; 02-21-2013 at 05:21 PM .

Albeit the probability is tiny.  On a heads up table you should expect this event to happen once every  2,501,314 hands if both players never fold pocket pairs preflop. The probability is given by this formula:    The first fraction accounts for the probability of a paired flop (roughly 17%), the second fraction for one player having a matching pair to flop a boat and the third fraction for the other player having a matching pair to flop quads.                    sixhigh   View Public Profile  Send a private message to sixhigh  Find More Posts by sixhigh  Find Threads Started by sixhigh                     02-21-2013, 07:55 PM   # 12       Sherman    Carpal \'Tunnel       Join Date: Jun 2005  Location: Psychology Department  Posts: 7,764         Re: Odds of flopping a full house vs quads        Quote:     Originally Posted by sixhigh    Albeit the probability is tiny.

Well yeah, if you make the most difficult situation to see this (i.e., heads up play). The fact is that these hands probably happen every day. It is just on some days that someone decides to report it here.

And the chance to have two players with pocket pairs at a 9-player table is much higher than the chance at heads-up.  Heads up it happens once in 285 deals.  At a full table it happens about 1 in 6.  So maybe 47 times as often, and that's not counting the times we have 3 or more pairs dealt.

The chance of  quads vs. full house is exactly 36 times as often as the heads up value of 1 in 1.25 million.  The chance that you get the full house and someone else makes quads is exactly 8 times the heads up value of 1 in 2.5 million.

I estimated it at just over 16%.     It's actually 9.5%.  You know in your head that it has to be less than 12.6% because your  1 in 285 was right, but we know for 9 players it must happen less than C(9,2) times more often because that would be the probability if the C(9,2) pairs of players were mutually exclusive.  So 12.6% overestimates the probability by over counting the cases where multiple pairs of players have pairs.  We also know that it has to be less than 11.9% because it must be less than  1 - [1 - 78*73/C(52,2)/C(50,2)]^C(9,2) = 11.9%  by the independence approximation.  It must be less than this because when 2 players don't have pocket pairs, it becomes more likely that the remaining pairs of players also don't have pocket pairs.  In fact, both of these 2 upper bounds are very loose, and the exact answer is 9.5% as I showed in this thread by generalized inclusion-exclusion.  Note that it is generalized because we want 2 or more players, so each line is multiplied by coefficients that come from the 2nd diagonal of Pascal's triangle (just 1,2,3....).  EDIT:  See later post for simple approximation that gives 9.67%.  If you just wanted the probability of quads vs. full house, you don't need the probability that 2 players have pairs because you can consider the flop first.  That makes the calculation much easier because then you don't have to worry about the cases where multiple pairs of players can have pairs.

If its not too much to ask, could you provide short  explanations for the R code lines that are not obvious.  For example, how does the while(1) {  work  how does the program know when to end the simulation?  And what does the F stand for in the sample(deck, 2*players, F) code  I guess the If statement may take a few extra lines of explanation.

Then if the 99.9% confidence interval is too wide when you stop it, the program can be restarted from the main while loop by highlighting everything from while(1) until the end, right clicking, and selecting "Run line or selection".  That will allow it to continue from where it left off, so you can run as many trials as you need.  F means sample without replacement.  T means sample with replacement.  The If line just compares the first 9 cards dealt to the second 9 cards dealt (1 to 10, 2 to 11, ...9 to 18) and sums the number of these where both cards are the same rank.  If there are 2 or more pairs, it increments a counter.  You can get help on any R function at the command prompt by typing ? followed by the function name.

It was assumed that the players already had the pocket pairs.  Without that assumption, yes it is much less frequent. But your calculation for Hero & someone else getting pocket pair in 6max is wrong. I'll fix it now in an edit.  Oh, furthermore, if more than one villain gets a unique PP then there are more flops that would make it happen. So we can't just use the probability that at least one villain gets a unique pocket pair; to be really exact, we have to make several calculations -- one for each exact number of villains having unique PP's.  I know I know, insert kindergarten humor.  Eh I'm working on something else atm so I'll return to this later or you /someone else can take a stab.

As the title of the thread says, I was wondering if anyone knew how to calculate the odds of flopping quads two hands in a row, because it happened to me about half an hour ago.  In the first hand I was BB and was dealt 2 4 off, and there were no raises preflop. The flop was all 2's. Unfortunately it checked all the way to the end, and there were five others involved in the hand. So no money made there.  In the second hand I was SB and was dealt pocket 9's. No one raised preflop, and I elected to not raise either. The flop was 9 7 9. This hand checked all the way as well, with three other people involved.  So while it's awesome I flopped back to back quads, it sucks I got zero action/profit on them.

Copy/paste: "odds of flopping quads" 2. Square that result 3. Raise 99 pre  Strictly speaking you should also factor in how likely you are to see a flop too.  Approx answer is 407^2 * 5 (if 20% VPiP)                    MeleaB   View Public Profile  Send a private message to MeleaB  Find More Posts by MeleaB  Find Threads Started by MeleaB                     03-23-2016, 06:30 PM   # 3       MadStranger    grinder    Join Date: Apr 2011  Location: Vancouver, Canada  Posts: 450         Re: Odds of Flopping Quads Two Hands in a Row      1 in 407 are the odds of flopping quads with a pocket pair. Without a pocket pair the odds are about 1 in 9799. So, if we know that the first hand is unpaired and the second is paired, the answer is 1 in 407*9799*whatever factor accounts for seeing the flop. So I'd say less than 1 in 10 million.

I once flopped quads back to back in a Holdem' poker tournament... pocket 99s in one hand, and then pocket 88s the very next hand. Both flopped quads, and both got paid-off, which is almost as unlikely . Anyhow, what are the odds of something like that happening? I would think they have to be pretty miniscule.                    akashenk   View Public Profile  Send a private message to akashenk  Find More Posts by akashenk  Find Threads Started by akashenk                     03-30-2015, 11:54 PM   # 2       GoFLOPyourself    enthusiast    Join Date: Jun 2014  Location: Casually adrift within.

Based upon the following info provided by statmanhal in a previous post of mine    Quote:     Originally Posted by statmanhal    Given a pair,the probability of flopping quads is C(2,2)*48/C(50,3) = 0.24%. The probability of getting a pair is 1/17. The probability of getting a pair AND then flopping quads is 0.24%/17 = 0.00014.     I am going to guess that the odds of flopping quads with a pair in your hand is 1 in 100 Million.  Of course, the likelihood that I am wrong is very high, so I look forward to seeing how others approach the question.

Posts: 67         Odds of flopping 3 or 4 Four of a kinds ?      A few years ago in a smoke filled half drunk garage game, the following scenario happened, and I've wondered the odds ever since.  Over the course of approximately 120 hands, I was dealt pocket pairs 3 times where I flopped quads (To the best of my recollection.) Each other player except one swear it was 4 times.  Nice thing was I took everyone of them to showdown and won some pots.  Given that we were 6 handed that night, what is the probability of flopping quads with a pocket pair 3 and 4 times. I have no idea where to start with the math other than multiplying the odds of flopping one 4 of a kind, but have no idea how to include the 120 hands.

Given a pair,the probability of flopping quads is C(2,2)*48/C(50,3) = 0.24%. The probability of getting a pair is 1/17. The probability of getting a pair AND then flopping quads is 0.24%/17 = 0.00014.  Now, to answer questions of this type, the question has to be precisely stated.  Do we assume the probability that exactly 3 or 3 or more pairs have occurred, or do we include the probability of getting exactly 3  or 3+ pairs, etc. In other words, what is given and what is to be calculated?  I’ll answer the question as follows. In 120 hands, you can expect to be dealt 7 pairs What is the probability that you flop quads at least 3 times given 7 pairs?. The binomial distribution provides the answer as 1.04682E-10 = 0.0000000001 or 1 in 10 billion times.  Could you all have been too drunk to remember exactly what happened.  NOTE; The above focuses on a specific player. For 6 players, the probability that at least one gets 3 or more quads is approximately 6 times the above answer. Still not big enough to not question the liquour holding capacity of all IMO.                    statmanhal   View Public Profile  Send a private message to statmanhal  Find More Posts by statmanhal  Find Threads Started by statmanhal                     12-19-2014, 07:53 PM   # 3       GoFLOPyourself    enthusiast    Join Date: Jun 2014  Location: Casually adrift within.

Still not big enough to not question the liquour holding capacity of all IMO.     Thanks statmanhal, I appreciate the help, and the inquiry into our state of drunkenness on the night in question.  (No sarcasm) I'd be one to question the recollection of such an event myself given the manner in which I introduced the story, and the odds of it being true.  I calculated the odds in a caveman way and they always end up making the odds of winning tho lottery look like a sure thing, almost..  I can unequivocally state the following; I myself was not inebriated anywhere close to the point of smearing or marring my recollection of the night.  I am a very occasional lightweight, drinking only a few times per year.  The others, excluding one, where quite inebriated and I believe this is what leads them to recall that it was actually 4 four of a kinds, not 3 as I have always recalled.  I have a very reliable witness who was completely sober on the night in question.  Here are the important details:  We played approximately 120 hands.  In three of those hands I was dealt a pocket pair (KK, JJ, 22).  On those particular hands I flopped the 4 of a kind.  I was the only one who got a four of a kind that night.  To answer your second paragraph question, I dealt other pocket pairs that did not quad on the flop.  So we'd be calculating probability that 3 or more pairs have occurred, but only 3 of them completed.  That corresponds with the way you calculated it, I believe.    Any other questions or clarifications I am happy to provide.

The reference to drinking was really said in jest. We get questions like yours all the time about very unlikely events occurring. One in 10 billion is obviously a very very unlikely event, but when many billions of hands are played every year, such events happen more than one expects.  It's just when they happen to you that makes them really remarkable.                    statmanhal   View Public Profile  Send a private message to statmanhal  Find More Posts by statmanhal  Find Threads Started by statmanhal                    12-20-2014, 12:36 AM   # 5       GoFLOPyourself    enthusiast    Join Date: Jun 2014  Location: Casually adrift within.  Posts: 67         Re: Odds of flopping 3 or 4 Four of a kinds ?      Well, what you state is very true.  In fact, I'll often ask people if they think they've ever shuffled a deck of cards so that the order of the 52 shuffled cards matches a shuffle they performed previously sometime in their life.  Some people think they have, but most, knowing me and the questions I ask, usually say no.  I'll then ask, what if I include all the shuffles of all the people you've ever played cards with?  Here I get a 50/50 split, where some will say yes, some will stick on no. Then I'll include all the people they've ever played with, plus all the people those people have ever played with, and at this point, most are willing to wager there has been a duplicate. If they stick on no, I'll ask, if we include every shuffle, since playing cards where invented, and every shuffle that's ever been made, if there has ever been a duplicate and most are now willing to consider the possibility.  Of course, the above is very unlikely in that there are something like 80 trillion trillion trillion billion million combinations that the deck can be shuffled in.  That makes the chance look infinitesimally small and very unlikely.  It does make my 1 in 10 billion look trillions and trillions of times more likely to happen than that, but still very unlikely.  I guess the whole point here is that many events in poker are just that, very unlikely, but given the fact that billions and billions of hands are played, this kind of thing indeed does happen, as you stated, just seeming special when we are involved with them.  Though in fact, if you took any two shuffles you've ever played with and asked the odds of having one shuffle followed by the next shuffle, those odds would be huge.  Even the odds of any shuffle are 80 trillion trillion... to 1.  Of course, the shuffle must end somewhere.  I knew the odds of my flopped 4 of a kinds was large, but had to idea it'd be out of the hundreds of millions to 1.  I always told people that I was probably more likely to win the lottery, but never could give a real number.  Thanks for providing the math.  I am looking to take a math course in the new year to try and start understanding probability, or at least how to begin calculating them.  ...  A few related points to how the cards unfolded.  On the very first hand played that night, I was dealt JJ.  A friend of mine in early position made it 3x to go.  I thought it was too small a raise in this game to be anything very good so I 3 bet him, to which he shoved.  I guess a fold could be in order here, but this was a few years before I knew such things.  My brother dealt the flop.  J in the window, and one more when he fanned it out.  Later, another player joined the game, and of the lot of us I'd venture to say he was the best player at the table.  I was dealt deuces against him.  Flopped quads and went to showdown.  He was amazed and talking about the odds of flopping the hand.  Over the drunkenness permeating the room, it was conveyed that it was the second time it had happened.  Flash forward about four hours later, and we were playing the last hand before the end of re-buys; it was getting late.  The board paired Kings, and to my amazement, the four players in front of me were all going all in, probably figuring if they lost they could re-buy, and they were mostly under a full stack anyway.  After a few minutes of them making side pots, I whispered to my brother "Guess what I got?' and it was half heard by the room, at which point I flipped them over, pocket Kings, and pandemonium erupted.    Thanks again for taking the time to consider the answer. Appreciate it.

There are 48 x 47 x 46 possible flops = 103,776 There are 4 x 3 x 2 possible flops using only case cards = 24  So the probability is 24 divided by 103776 = about 4300 to 1.  ------------------------  To verify:  We know that flopping quads is about 400 to 1 if holding a pair. Well the odd card must match the card in the other players hand... there are only two of them and 46 unknown cards so it's about a 1 in 23 shot.  Multiple the 1 in 23 shot by the 1 in 400 shot and you get about a 1 in 9200. Now we halve this (as we have two players who can do it) so that's about 4600 to 1... which is close to what we got above.  ------------------------  Caveat: Friday + Tired + No access to calculator = High Chance of Error                    hepzebah   View Public Profile  Send a private message to hepzebah  Find More Posts by hepzebah  Find Threads Started by hepzebah                     10-29-2010, 12:11 PM   # 3       bachfan    adept    Join Date: Nov 2005  Location: Colorado  Posts: 888         Re: Odds of flopped quads over flopped full house        Quote:     Originally Posted by VpBob    In 9 handed hold'em, what are the odds that one player flops quads while another flops a full house at the same time, each having been dealt a pocket pair.

Another chance to pimp my new tool at http://propokertools.com/pql   If we narrow the problem to say 'how often do two players in hold'em who are dealt pocket pairs flop one full house and one quads', then we get 0.02 select count(handshaving(exactHandType, flop, quads) = 1 and handshaving(exactHandType, flop, fullhouse) = 1) from game='holdem', p1='AA-22', p2='AA-22' Results: Trials 	COUNT 1 600000 	129 (0.02%)  If we ask 'how often with nine random holdem hands does one player have quads and another have a full house'  we get a similar number. select count(handshaving(exactHandType, flop, quads) = 1 and handshaving(exactHandType, flop, fullhouse) = 1) from game='holdem', p1='**', p2='**', p3='**', p4='**', p5='**', p6='**', p7='**', p8='**', p9='**' Results: Trials 	COUNT 1 600000 	185 (0.03%)  The only problem with the above is that we have included flops that look like '3s3h3d' - without loss of generality, we can specify a flop with a pair which should give the correct answer: select count(handshaving(exactHandType, flop, quads) = 1 and handshaving(exactHandType, flop, fullhouse) = 1) from game='holdem', p1='**', p2='**', p3='**', p4='**', p5='**', p6='**', p7='**', p8='**', p9='**', board='AsAhTd' Results: Trials 	COUNT 1 600000 	97 (0.02%)  Or, equivalently, select count(handshaving(inRange, 'TT') = 1 and handshaving(inRange, 'AA') = 1) from game='holdem', p1='**', p2='**', p3='**', p4='**', p5='**', p6='**', p7='**', p8='**', p9='**', board='AsAhTd ' Results: Trials 	COUNT 1 600000 	92 (0.02%)                    bachfan   View Public Profile  Send a private message to bachfan  Find More Posts by bachfan  Find Threads Started by bachfan                    10-29-2010, 12:17 PM   # 4       statmanhal    Pooh-Bah    Join Date: Jan 2009  Posts: 4,063         Re: Odds of flopped quads over flopped full house      This confirms hepzebah's result using combinations.  For quads, 2 out of 2 cards have to flop. For the full house, the third flop card has to be 1 of 2 remaining of the rank held by other player. So, for player A to have quads and player B to have a full house,  Pr = C(2,2)*C(2,1)/C(48,3).  Since A can have the full house and B the quads, we double this to get Pr = 0.00231 or a 1 in 4324 chance.                    statmanhal   View Public Profile  Send a private message to statmanhal  Find More Posts by statmanhal  Find Threads Started by statmanhal                             Tweet           «  Previous Thread | Next Thread  »       Thread Tools        Show Printable Version   Email this Page       Display Modes        Linear Mode   Switch to Hybrid Mode   Switch to Threaded Mode                 Posting Rules       You may not post new threads  You may not post replies  You may not post attachments  You may not edit your posts   BB code is On  Smilies are On  [IMG] code is On  HTML code is Off   Forum Rules                      Forum Jump    User Control Panel  Private Messages  Subscriptions  Who's Online  Search Forums  Forums Home    Links to Popular Forums  News, Views, and Gossip  Beginners Questions  Marketplace & Staking  Casino & Cardroom Poker  Internet Poker  NL Strategy Forums  Poker Goals & Challenges  Las Vegas Lifestyle  Sporting Events  Politics  Other Other Topics  Two Plus Two  About the Forums  Two Plus Two Magazine Forum  The Two Plus Two Bonus Program  Two Plus Two Pokercast  The Best of Two Plus Two  Marketplace & Staking  Commercial Marketplace  General Marketplace  Staking - Offering Stakes  Staking  Staking - Offering Stakes  Staking - Seeking Stakes  Staking - Selling Shares - Online  Staking - Selling Shares - Live  Staking Rails  Transaction Feedback & Disputes  Transaction Feedback & Disputes  Coaching & Training  Coaching Advice  Cash Game Poker Coach Listings  Tournament/SNG Poker Coach Listings  Poker News & Discussion  News, Views, and Gossip  Poker Goals & Challenges  Poker Beats, Brags, and Variance  That's What She Said!

I'm having real trouble with having a starting pair and then flopping quads. According to charts, the probability of that happening is 0.25% or 400 to 1. I do not get this answer at all.  I managed to work out the probability the same as in the chart of a starting pair flopping a set (around 12% or 8 to 1). I'm assuming you have to combine the probability first of all of getting dealt a pair ([13C1][4C2]/[52C2]). I have no idea how to do it though. For the actual flop, I've tried numerous ways but it has all been in vain.  Can someone explain and demonstrate how exactly they calculate this as being 0.25%?  EDIT: Additional Information  In Texas Hold'Em Poker, you are dealt two cards to begin with. After some betting occurs, we see the "flop", which is three community cards dealt into the middle of the table that everyone can use towards making their poker hand. In this example, if you began with, for example, two Aces, and within the three cards in the "flop" there were the other two Aces, you would have "quads" (termed "flopping quads"). This could happen in another way too however. You could start with two random cards (not paired) and then the flop has the three other cards of one of your starting cards (example, you have are dealt an Ace and a King to start, and then there are three Kings in the flop). I'm specifically interested in starting with a pair and then the only other two cards of this rank in the remaining 50 cards coming out in the flop.  So there are 52 cards to begin; after you being dealt your 2 starting cards, there are 50 cards remaining from which three are taken to make the "flop".    binomial  theory  games     share | cite | improve this question      edited Oct 13 '16 at 19:06             asked Oct 13 '16 at 18:57       삼마패신암행어사   8 6              add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote  accepted      You are dealing with a Hypergeometric distribution. Rather than just quoting the formula, which you can check out yourself, let's derive how it applies in this particular case.  After having been dealt your two original cards, if they are a pair, you need 2 of the 3 cards on the flop to have the same value. Since there are 50 cards left to choose from, you have $\binom{50}{3}$ possible flops. How many of these will yield four of a kind? To answer this, notice that such a flop will have one "free" card (doesn't matter what it is) and two that must be there. So, if we restrict ourselves to flops that have the two cards we want, we are left with $\binom{48}{1}$ since we have removed the two matching cards and have to select one of the remaining 48.  Thus, the probability is $\frac{\binom{48}{1}}{\binom{50}{3}} = \frac{48}{\frac{50!}{3!47!}} = \frac{1}{50 \times 49 / 6} = \frac{3}{25 \times 49} \approx \frac{1}{408}$.  So, it's not exactly 1 in 400 but very close.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 13 '16 at 20:13       Josh Magarick   394 1 6                  +1: this is an exemplary explanation for its clarity and logical analysis. – whuber ♦  Oct 13 '16 at 21:09        add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Welcome to the poker odds calculator. Please supply the following four parameters:  Total: How many cards in the deck.  Drawn: How many cards we are drawing.  Outs: How many outs in the deck.  Required: How many outs are required (this many or more).

What are the chances of ...    ... being dealt pocket aces?  This is before hole cards are dealt, so all 52 cards are in the deck, so our Total Cards is 52.
We are looking for two aces in our hole cards. Since there are four aces in the
deck, we have 4 Outs. We are drawing 2 cards, and we need two of our 4 Outs. Outs: 4, Required Outs: 2, Cards Drawn: 2, Total Cards: 52 . The odds are 220:1 to be dealt Aces (or any specific pocket pair.) [see it]     ... flopping a set with any two paired cards?  Lets say we hold pocket 3's. We want another 3 on the flop. There are two more 3's in the
deck, so we have 2 outs. We need one of the remaining 3's on the flop to get
a set. There are three cards on the flop, so three cards will be drawn from a total
of 50 cards (we hold two of them in our hand already.) You have 7.5:1 odds of
flopping a set (or quads). [see it]     ... catching set by the river with any two paired cards?  Now we want to know, holding a given pocket pair, what are the chances of catching a set
by the river card. We are basically adding another two cards to our
number of cards drawn. You have 4.2:1 odds of catching a set (or quads). [see it]     ... flopping quads with any two paired cards?  We hold pocket 6's. What are the chances of flopping quads. There are two more 6's in the
deck (2 outs), we need both of them (required outs.) Three cards on the flop. You
have a 407:1 chance of flopping quads. [see it]     ... flopping boat with any two unpaired cards? (including quads)  Let's say you hold a 7 and 8. There are three more 7's and three more 8's in the deck, you need
three of those six outs on the flop. You have a 979:1 shot at it. [see it]     ... flopping flush with any two suited cards?  You hold two spades. There are 13 spades in the deck, so there are 11 left. To flop a flush,
we must hit three of our 11 outs on the flop. You have 118:1 shot at it. [see it]     ... catching flush by turn/river with four suited cards?  You hold two spades, and two more hit the flop. What are the chances of catching at least
one more? There are 9 more spades in the deck, we need one of them on the turn or river.
We are drawing 2 cards from the remaining 47 in the deck. You have a 1.9:1 chance to hit
one (or two) spades. [see it]     ... turning flush with four suited cards?  You hold two spades, and two more hit the flop. What are the chances of catching the flush
on the turn? There are 9 more spades in the deck, we need one of them.
We are drawing 1 card from the remaining 47 in the deck. You have a 4.2:1 chance. [see it]     ... rivering flush with four suited cards?  You hold two spades, and two more hit the flop. The turn missed. What are the chances of catching the flush
on the river? There are 9 more spades in the deck, we need one of them.

Gambling led to the development of probability theory in the late 1400s. When playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli released his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Paccioli’s work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae , discussed the concepts of probability and how they directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any recognition because it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de Méré, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De Méré tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascal’s work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling. [1]  [2]  Frequency of 5-card poker hands [ edit ]     A Venn diagram depicting poker hands and their odds from a typical American 9/6 Jacks or Better machine    The following chart enumerates the (absolute) frequency of each hand, given all combinations of 5 cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement. Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:   Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits.  Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, including the same card values in different suits.  The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand ( Frequency ) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space ;             (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle \,{\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   ). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is 4 / 2,598,960 , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, that's nearly 0.000154% of the time.  Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as or better than the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand at least as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand's probability with the probabilities of all hands above it.  The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways not to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else (2,598,960 - 4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956 : 4, or 649,739 : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as (1/p) - 1 : 1 , where p is the aforementioned probability.  The values given for Probability , Cumulative probability , and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.   The nCr function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering nCr with 52 and 5 , for example, yields            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   as above.

It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739 : 1.  When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.  Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ is identical to 3♦ 7♦ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.  The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ and 3♦ 7♣ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only two—that difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.  Frequency of 7-card poker hands [ edit ]  In some popular variations of poker, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   . It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is less than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.  The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).      Hand  Frequency  Probability  Cumulative  Odds    Royal flush  4,324  0.0032%  0.0032%  30,939 : 1    Straight flush (excl. royal flush)  37,260  0.0279%  0.0311%  3,589.6 : 1    Four of a kind  224,848  0.168%  0.199%  594 : 1    Full house  3,473,184  2.60%  2.80%  37.5 : 1    Flush  4,047,644  3.03%  5.82%  32.1 : 1    Straight  6,180,020  4.62%  10.4%  20.6 : 1    Three of a kind  6,461,620  4.83%  15.3%  19.7 : 1    Two pair  31,433,400  23.5%  38.8%  3.26 : 1    One pair  58,627,800  43.8%  82.6%  1.28 : 1    No pair  23,294,460  17.4%  100%  4.74 : 1    Total  133,784,560  100%  100%  0 : 1      (The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)  Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.  The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards because some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high).  Frequency of 5-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  Some variants of poker, called lowball , use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel .

Frequency of 7-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  In some variants of poker a player uses the best five-card low hand selected from seven cards. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel . The probability is calculated based on            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   , the total number of 7-card combinations.  The table does not extend to include five-card hands with at least one pair. Its "Total" represents 95.4% of the time that a player can select a 5-card low hand without any pair.

Rick from Gardnerville, USA   Assuming you draw five cards, and count all hands with exactly two jacks, then the probability would be combin(4,2)*combin(48,3)/combin(52,5) = 6*17296/2598960 = 3.99%.     Thank goodness I just discovered your great site. I have been trying to solve the following, and keep getting different answers. If I am dealt a pocket pair (in Hold'em) what are my chances of getting either three of a kind, or four of a kind on the flop (next three cards).  Elliot from Harwich, Massachusetts   For probability questions, I like to take the number of combinations the event you're interested can happen divided by the total number of combinations. First review the combin function in my probabilities in poker section. The number of ways to get a four of a kind is simply the number of singletons in the deck, or 48. The number of ways to get a three of a kind (not including a full house) is the product of the number of ways to get the third card, 2, and the number of ways to get two other singletons, 2*combin(12,2)*4 2 = 2,112. The total number of ways the cards can come up in the flop are combin(50,3)=19,600. So, the probability of a four of a kind is 48/19600=0.0024, and the probability of a three of a kind is 2,112/19,600=0.1078.     In hold em poker, what are the odds of being dealt pocket aces? And what are the odds of being dealt pocket aces twice in a row?  Adam from Redding, USA   There are 52*51/2 = 1326 ways to arrange 2 cards out of 52. There are 4*3/2=6 ways to arrange 2 aces out of 4. So the answer is 6/1326 = 1/221. The probability of this happening twice in a row is (1/221) 2 = 1 in 48,841.     If ten people are each dealt two cards from a single deck what is the probability that two players will get a pair of aces?  Anonymous   First, there are 10*9/2=45 ways you can choose 2 players out of 10. The probability of two specific players getting four aces is 1/combin(52,4)=1/270725. So the probability of any two players getting a pair of aces is 45/270725=0.0001662.     In a 10-handed game of Texas Hold 'em, and the flop is three different ranks, what is the probability that three players have a set?  Anonymous   For those unfamiliar with the terminology, each player gets two cards to himself and the three flop cards are shared among all players. So this is the same as asking if you dealt three community cards, all of different ranks, and ten 2-card hands, what is the probability three of the 2-card hands would be pairs that match one of the three community cards.  The probability player 1 has a set is 3* combin (3,2)/combin(49,2). Then the probability player 2 has a set is 2*combin(3,2)/combin(47,2). Then the probability player 3 has a set is combin(3,2)/combin(45,2). However, any three players can the three sets, not necessarily the first three. There are combin(10,3) ways to choose the 3 players out of 10 that have sets. So the answer is combin(10,3)*(3*combin(3,2)/combin(49,2))*(2*combin(3,2)/combin(47,2))*(combin(3,2)/combin(45,2)) = 0.00000154464 = 1 in 64,740.     Hi - Thank you for your web site. I'm wondering if you can tell me what are the odds if you are dealt Q-Q that any of the remaining 8 people at the table would be dealt A-A, A-K, K-K, or A-Q? Thank you!  Anonymous   For any given person the probability of having AA is combin (4,2)/combin(50,2) = 6/1,225 = 0.0049 because there are 6 ways to pick 2 aces out of 4, and 1225 ways to pick any 2 cards out of the 50 left in the deck. The probability is the same for a pair of kings. For A-K the probability is 4*4/1,225=0.0131, because there are 4 ways to get an ace and 4 ways to get a king. For A-Q the probability is 4*2/1225=0.0065, because there are 4 aces but only 2 queens left in the deck. So the probability any given player will have one of these hands is (6+6+16+8)/1225 = 0.0294. Now the next step is clearly not perfect because if one player doesn't have one of these hands the odds the next player does is a little bit higher. Forgetting this for the sake of simplicity the probability no player has one of these hands is (1-0.0294) 8 = 78.77%. So the probability at least one player has one of these hands is 21.23%.     In Texas hold em, if two players are dealt a pocket pair pre-flop, what are the odds of each of these players flopping a set(three of a kind)?  Bob from Cincinnati   Let’s assume you have a pair of aces.  Before considering that the other player has another pair the probability of flopping a three of a kind is the [nc(one ace)*nc(two ranks out of 12)*nc(one suit out of 4) 2 + nc(any other three of a kind)]/nc(any three cards), where nc(x) = number of combinations of x.  This equals [2* combin (12,2)*4 2 +12*combin(4,3)]/combin(50,3) = (2112+48)/19600 = 11.020%.  Now lets assume the other player has any other pair, but not the same as yours.  Then probability becomes [2*(combin(11,2)*4 2 + 11*2*4 + 11*combin(4,3)]/combin(48,3) = 11.4477%.     What are the chances in a heads up game of Texas Hold’em that each player gets KK. Then on the very next hand both players get KK. We can’t even get a close estimate. If you can figure it out please respond, thanks.  Anonymous   The probability for any given hand is ( combin (4,2)/combin(52,2))*(1/combin(50,2)) = 1/270725.  So, the probability of this happening twice in a row is 1 in 270,725 2 = 1 in 73,292,025,625.     What are the odds of a pair showing on the board on the flop in Holdem ? ie., A A 10 or 5 Q 5, etc.  Stephen from Addison   13*12* combin (4,2)*4/combin(52,3) = 3744/22100 = 16.941%.     Thanks for the help your site has given. You’ve probably saved me thousands.   I was playing in a NL Texas Hold 'em tournament on-line recently, and was dealt pocket kings (at a 10-man table) only to be dominated by pocket aces. I'd like to know the probability, given the condition that you have a pair, of at least one other player at the 10-man table having a higher pair than yours (in other words, having a "dominated pair"). Thanks again!  Dan from Cairo, Egypt   The following table shows estimated probabilities that a pair will be beaten by at least one higher pair according to the number of players (including yourself).  These probabilities are not exact because the hands are not independent.  However to find the exact probabilities would get complicated and I think these are pretty close.  My formula is 1-(1-r* combin (4,2)/combin(50,2)) (n-1) , where r=number of higher ranks than your pair, and n = total number of players.  The table shows the probability of another player having a pair of aces, when you have a pair of kings, in a 10-player game, to be 4.323%.

Chris from Hampton   Let's call the players A, B, and C.  The probability A has a pair of aces is combin (4,2)/combin(52,2) = 6/1326. The probability B has a pair of kings is combin(4,2)/combin(50,2) = 6/1225. The probability C has a pair of queens is combin(4,2)/combin(48,2) = 6/1128.  However there are 3! = 1*2*3 = 6 ways you can arrange three pairs between three players.  So, the answer is 6*(6/1326)*(6/1225)*(6/1128) = 0.000000707321.     I’ve been a huge fan for many years (even before you got interested in poker and sports betting) and looked forward to every Ask The Wizard column. It’s great to see you’re doing them again!  My question is this: at my local card room, they offer Aces Cracked, Win A Rack during certain hours. That is, if you have pocket Aces in one of their 3-6 or 4-8 Texas Hold ’Em games and you lose the pot, the casino will give you a rack of chips ($100). I’m trying to figure out how often a)I get pocket Aces b)how often they would lose if I played them aggressively as I’m supposed to and c)whether it’s not better to just check all the way down and hope to lose, as $100 is usually better than what the pot would have been anyway.  Any stats you may have at the ready would be wonderful and forever appreciated!  Thanks again and keep up enlightening the masses!  Shane from Santa Rosa   Thanks for the kind words.  The probability you will get pocket aces in any one hand is 6/1326, or once every 221 hands.  According to my 10-player Texas Hold ’em section (/games/texas-hold-em/10players.html) the probability of winning with pocket aces is 31.36%, assuming all players stay in until the end.  However that is a big if.  If forced to make a guess I’d estimate the probability of winning with aces in a real 10-player game is about 70%.  So the probability of getting pocket aces and then losing is 0.3*(1/221) = 0.1357%.  So, at $100 per incident that is worth 13.57 cents per hand.  Over ten people that costs the poker room $1.36 per hand on average, which cuts into the rake quite a bit.  I tend to agree with your strategy of calling, which will keep more players in the hand, and increase your chance of losing.     What are the odds of having pocket aces and pocket kings both being dealt in the same hand?  Jake from Loveland, CO   The odds of a specific player having aces is combin (4,2)/combin(52,2) = 6/1326.  The odds of the next player having a pair of kings is combin(4,2)/combin(50,2) = 6/1225.  However, in a ten-player game there are 10 possible players who could get the aces, and 9 possible players for the kings.  So a strong approximation would be 10*9*(6/1326)*(6/1225) = 0.001995, or 1 in 501.  This answer is slightly too high, because it double counts the situation where two players have aces, or two have kings, or both.     Hello, thank you for a very interesting and informative site. I have a question of my own that I hope you can answer for me. As a Texas hold 'em player, I pay special attention to pocket pairs, and have particular interest towards 10-10 or J-J or similar, as on the surface they appear strong but can be beaten easily.  My question however, is how do you work out the probability of there being at least one person on your table holding a higher pocket pair to yours?  Andrew from St. Albans   The math of this gets very messy due to the possibility of more than one playing having a higher pair, including the same type of pair.  For example if you have pocket kings two players could have pocket aces.  However it is easy to show the expected number of players who will beat you.  This would be n*r*(6/1225), where n is the number of opponents, and r is the number of higher ranks.  The following table shows the average number of players who will have a higher pocket pair according to your pocket pair (left column) by the number of opponents (top row).

Given that assumption the probability that at least one player will beat you is 1-e -µ , where µ is the mean.  For examle if you have pocket queens and there are 9 other players the expected number of players with a higher pocket pair is 0.0882, so the probability of at least one player having a higher pocket pair is 1-e -0.0882 = 8.44%.  The table below shows those probabilities.

I have tried to work it out using a probability tree but my answer seems too high. Also on the net I have read different answers some suggesting it is around 1/3 or 2/5 or 1/2. What is the probability of at least pairing and is it possible to work this out using a probability tree? Your help will be much appreciated thanks.  Nathan S. from New Plymouth   For those not familiar with the hold 'em terminology, you are asking for the probability of at least a pair in six cards, given that the first two are (the hole cards) of different ranks.  I hope you'll forgive me if I just do the probability of getting exactly a pair, including hands that also form a straight or flush.  The number of ways to pair one of your hole cards is six (2 hole cards * 3 suits remaining).  The other three cards must all be of different ranks from the 11 left.  There are combin (11,3)=165 ways to choose 3 ranks out of 11.  For each of these there are four suits to choose from.  So the number of ways to pair one of your hole cards is 6*165*4 3 =63,360.  Now let's look at the number of ways to get a pair outside of the two hole cards.  There are 11 ranks to choose from for the pair.  Once the pair is chosen there are combin(4,2)=6 ways to choose 2 suits out of 4.  For the other two cards there are combin(10,2)=45 ways to choose 2 ranks out of the 10 fully intact ranks left.  For both of those ranks there are 4 possible suits.  So the total combinations for a pair, not including the hole cards, is 11*6*45*4 2 =47,520. The total number of ways to choose 4 cards out of the 50 left in the deck is combin(50,4)=230,300.  So the probability of getting exactly a pair in six cards is (63,360+47,520)/230,300 = 48.15%.     Last night I played a hand where three players all hit sets on the flop.  Luckily for me I had AA against QQ and 22.  What is the probability that three players hit sets on the flop?  Cheers  Gareth H. from Auckland, NZ   The probability of three different ranks in the flop is combin (13,3)×4 3 /combin(52,3) = 0.828235.  There are combin(10,3)=120 ways you can choose three players out of ten.  Of the three, the probability the first will have a set is 3×combin(3,2)/combin(49,2) = 0.007653061.  The probability the second will have a set is 2×combin(3,2)/combin(47,2) = 0.005550416. The probability the third will have a set is combin(3,2)/combin(45,2) = 0.003030303.  Take the product of all this and the probability is  0.828235 × 120 × 0.007653061 × 0.005550416 × 0.003030303 = 0.00001279, or 1 in 78,166.     In 55,088 hands of poker I had a pair going into the flop 2,787 times.  Of those 2,787 I hit a set 273 times.  How does that square with expectations?  Linus from Alings&aring;s, Sweden   For readers who may not know, a "set" is a three of a kind after the flop, including a pocket pair.  The probability of not making a set is (48+combin(48,3))/combin(50,3) = 17,344/19600 = 88.49%.  So the probability of making a set is 11.51%.  In 2,787 pairs you should have made a set 320.8 times.  So you are 47.8 sets under expectations.  The variance is n × p × (1-p), where n = number of hands, and p = probability of making the set.  In this case the variance is 2,787 × .1176 × .8824 = 283.86.  The standard deviation is the square root of that, or 16.85.  So you are 47.8/16.85 = 2.84 standard deviations south of expectations.  The probability of luck this bad or worse can be found in any Standard Normal table, or in Excel as norsdist(-2.84) = 0.002256, or 1 in 443.     I feel I was cheated in a poker game. According to my math,  AA vs. KK will happen once every 45,000 hands heads up, but it happened to me 3 times in 400 hands.  Is this unlikely enough to suspect something?  Rafael   The probability of being on the losing end of KK vs. AA is  ( combin (4,2)/combin(52,2)) × (combin(4,2)/combin(50,2)) = 0.000022162, for each opponent at the table.  That is once every 45,121 hands, so your math was right.  The expected number of times that would happen in 400 hands is 400 × 0.000022162 = 0.008865084, per opponent.  The following table shows the probability of 3 or more instances of having KK against AA in 400 hands, by the number of opponents.   3+ KK vs AA probability in 400 hands    Opponents  Probability  Inverse   1  0.0000001145  1 in 8,734,376   2  0.0000009133  1 in 1,094,949   3  0.0000030658  1 in 326,182   4  0.0000072234  1 in 138,438   5  0.0000140202  1 in 71,325   6  0.0000240728  1 in 41,541   7  0.000037981  1 in 26,329   8  0.0000563277  1 in 17,753   9  0.0000796798  1 in 12,550    So, yes, I would say this looks fishy.  The fewer the players, the more fishy it looks.  I would be interested to know where this game was.  Great Site!!  If I have pocket Queens, what is the chance that an Ace or King will come by the river?  A simple fundamental question, but one that will help me tremendously.  Ed Miller from Banning CA   Thanks.  There are 50 cards left in the deck, and 42 of them are not aces or kings.  The probability of not seeing any aces or kings in five community cards is combin (42,5)/combin(50,5) = 850,668/2,118,760=40.15%.  So, the probability of seeing at least one ace or king is 100% - 40.15% = 59.85%.    This happened to me this week, and am eagerly curious as to the statistic.  Over two nights, I held Pocket Aces 3 times in total, and all 3 times I had them there was another player on the table of 10 players also with Pocket Aces.  I have not been able to find the probability of this happening anywhere and I hope you can shed some light on this. On a full table of 10 players, what is the chance of this happening?  Rob T. from Hong Kong   The probability of a specific other player having pocket aces, given that you do, is (2/50)×(1/49) = 1 in 1,225.  Given 9 other players, the probability is 9 times that, or 1 in 136.  This might seem like an abuse of taking the sum of probabilities.  However, it is okay if only one player can get the two aces.  To answer your question, the probability that another player had pockets aces three out of the three times you had pockets aces is  (9×(2/50)×(1/49)) 3 = 1 in 2,521,626.

Hi everyone,   I'm looking for the specific odds of making quads with a pocket pair by the river. If you ran out all the community cards.  Also, odds of making quads on the flop. Thank you.                                      #2     12th May 2016, 7:17 AM             Shaetano [84]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Holdem              Hey, here you go  Draw Probabilities for obtaining quads with pocket pair hole cards Complete on Flop: 0.245% Complete on Turn: 2.128% Complete on River: 2.174%                                   #3     12th May 2016, 7:26 AM              Aaron Soto [250]         Poker at: Bovada  Game: NL HOLDEM              Okay, so basically, your saying its about 1 in 50 I make quads by the turn? With a pocket pair? That can't be right.....I need the 1/10 type not percents. 0.245% on flop equates to about what? 1 in 400 which actually, seems correct. I can't see that by adding one more card (the turn) it becomes 1 in 50 no way.....                                   #4     12th May 2016, 9:24 AM           Excomm [30]         Online Poker at: BOL / ACR  Game: NLHE              It may be surprising, but that is the probability of drawing to 1 out on the turn (46:1) and the river (45:1).  It is the same probability of completing a straight flush draw as well.  The probabilities that Shaetano posted above are correct.  Think of it this way.  To make quads...  On the flop you are trying to draw 2 cards out of 50 and then 1 card out of 49 OR 2 cards out of 50 and then 1 card out of 48 OR 2 cards out of 49 and then 1 card out of 48.  On the Turn you are trying to draw just 1 card out of 47 (not that hard).  On the River you are trying to draw 1 card out of 46 (only a little worse than trying to get a powerball match  )                                   #5     12th May 2016, 9:46 AM              TimovieMan [2,264]         Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Texas Holdem                   Originally Posted by Aaron Soto   I need the 1/10 type not percents.

Incorrect.  I hope my wording will be clear.  You subtract 1 from the 408.1633 to get the accurate number. It happens once in 408 hands, so the odds of it happening are 407:1.  Odds of 25% are 3:1, not 4:1 (as that would be 20%). It'll happen 25% of the time, or once in 4, but the odds are 3:1.   So it's ((100 / odds %) - 1 ) : 1.                                   #9     12th May 2016, 4:31 PM              SuzdalDEcor [511]                          Originally Posted by TimovieMan   Because converting is hard?

And the River probability is also misleading.        Fair enough.  It's true that the odds of making quads only improve significantly if you flop a set.  These are the odds of getting quads (when dealt a pocket pair) (or a straight flush with two suited and connected cards) WITHOUT assuming that you flopped a set.  *edit* Note that the odds for the turn include quads made on the flop, and the odds for the river include quads made on the flop and the turn.  Later today if I have time I'll figure out the odds of making these hands EXACTLY on the turn and river.  on Flop:  0.145 (407.33:1) by Turn:  0.490 (203.17:1) by River: 0.816 (121.50:1)  My bad for misinterpreting the original question.                                   #14     13th May 2016, 10:01 PM              Dutchtegon [155]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: holdem              Its nice to know such little facts, but I guess you are not going to play for those kind of things. When playing on pokerstars there are people wo do, and in general you can take their money without any problem, but when you lose from them the rage is to big to describe.                                   #15     13th May 2016, 10:25 PM           Excomm [30]         Poker at: BOL / ACR  Game: NLHE              I made a typo in my last response so I'll post the odds again here (sorry for the confusion)  on Flop  0.245 (407.33:1) (changed from the 0.145 typo) by Turn  0.490 (203.17:1) by River 0.816 (121.50:1)  If we subtract the quads made on previous streets then we will get the odds of hitting quads EXACTLY on those streets.  on Flop  0.245 (407.33:1) on Turn  0.245 (407.33:1) on River 0.327 (305.25:1)                                   #16     13th May 2016, 11:02 PM           shmucky [3]                     side note.       funny you bring this up. I just saw quad fours on the flop busted by a straight flush on the river. it was free roll on sports betting but painful to see lol                                  #17     27th December 2017, 10:23 AM             Mikeisanace777 [84]                     All the other answers are based on false Data mostly..       These odds are based on similar video poker data not real live poker ,or even online .The reason for this is sometimes,or a lot of times you have 0% whereas video poker it's always the same there are no hole cards and no burn cards which influence the unknown variables of quads and all hands in holdem poker by a lot!! Sometimes to hit the quads the card you need is burned,or usually folded or in play therefore it's not predictable at all. Same goes for a set it may be 1/8 chance to flop it or sometimes based on a 9 ring game and 3 burn cards could be 0% it's always fluctuates and this goes for flush draws,and all draws. In fact if you knew the remaining 31 cards in the deck vs other players hands you would always know what to do right? Say you got A/7 of spades in a limit game and you knew your up against KA off AQ off and jj but you somehow magically could see the remaining 31 cards and the burns then you would continue even after the flop. For instance say the flop came 9-A-8 with 2 spades vs the previous match ups I described in a good size pot,but you knew the remaining cards contained 3 sevens-2 aces and 2 eights, and to go with that the full match up of spades in the deck vs AK this is a huge beni factor for you as you got many cards to fill up,chop and 9 outs to flush out in your spade draw. Of course you never actually know this this is why Holdem poker is an incomplete data game there is no good cards in holdem especially limit holdem. As I said before you never know what could occur! Say you have kk vs 10-j and 67 with the remaining cards to be seen as 89-9 a load of 7's 10's and 2 fives all within that spectrum of the top of the deck,what makes matters worse even in the 31 random deck scenario vs these types of hands sometimes your kings aren't even in there and no running pairs to give you a counterfeit 2 pair either so your essentially dead in the water vs probable 2 pair flops like 8-10-4 -Q-5-10 etc.. It doesn't mean your one pair won't be gold it just means your hoping to hold up with no chance of improving. So to hit Quads on a flopped set of 99 all the stars have to line up right just the even have the true odds to make it in that scenario. Iv'e seen your previous posts and you enjoy 3/6 limit and play a lot you check on my post on advanced 3/6 theory gl man.

This was the most memorable hand last year during Summer... I want to hear insights and what I could've done better... Visited Macau with a buddy just for half a day... Buddy went to 2/5 (roughly that amount from HKD) and I'm was a beginner and still a beginner so I went to 1/2... bought in for about 400... Table was mainly Chinese Mainlanders who were either 1)extremely Loose Passive 2) extremely Tight Aggressive.... Mostly calling stations with huge bankrolls , just buying in again and again after making donkey calls.... So although it was a 1/2, most players had 1000+... Played for good two to three hours,  and about the beginning of the hand my stack went up to around 1000 USD... sitting right of the Cut-Off position, got dealt pocket 77.... My table image at that point was Loose Aggressive...  UTG raises to 12BB 24 USD... two mid-position callers, I also call aiming to set-mine, and cut-off and button calls, 6 callers pre-flop pot was 150USD.... Flop was 7h7d8h... At that point my hands just started to shake, partially from the cocaine I've been taking in the bathroom and the dopamine coming out from the joy of me paying out... UTG who was the initial raiser just checks and it gets checked down to me and I check to trap the table, wishing for a heart to show up... the whole table checks... the Turn is a Qh and UTG bets 100 USD, two mid-position folds and I hollywood for a bit and call, cut-off calls and button calls... Now the pot is 550 USD.... River is Jd... UTG bets 300, with 200 left behind him and I go all in with around 850, a pot sized all-in.... cut-off insta-folds and the button thinks for a while and calls and UTG calls... I insta-show the quads and they muck  their hands, I take down around 2k.... 1) So if you guys hit quads in this situation on the flop, would you guys just slow play trying to trap or add value to the 150 pot? 2) Also, would it be correct to range UTG as pocket QQ, making a full-house and the button suited hearts, making a flush? UTG was one of the TAGs who rarely played and button was a chinese girl who were one of the passive calling stations as I remember.... If I made a set instead on the flop, should I have raised to avoid the button making the flush?? 3) If you guys could rate it, was this hand played correctly or not?  Thanks.. and may the poker gods be with y'all  Also sorry for some lack of information... this was a live poker hand from macau last summer...                                      #2     11th February 2017, 4:16 AM           stokedog4 [158]         Online Poker at: pokerstars  Game: holdem              You played it well and I doubt you make more in that spot.

Flop came J47, I was SB check guy in MP goes all in, button calls.  I had the button covered and was like WTF, we all can't have sets.  So I push all in, button calls and sure enough we all had sets.  Only time I've ever seen it.  The odds of floping a set are not 1/8 it's 1/17 I believe.                                   #13     14th June 2009, 4:50 AM              cardplayer52 [1,195]         Online Poker at: full tilt  Game: holdem              ok my math could be off but i think i'm right. if you start w/3 different pairs preflop. the odds of all 3 hitting a set on the flop would be 2/46 x 2/45 x 2/44 = .0000878 too express that as odds you multiply by 100 then divide 100 by the result. which works out to be 11,390 to 1. but i looked at a chart of 1000 hands dealt to 10 players and it said 3+ pair were dealt 1.49%(this was 10handed but it also didnt say diferent pairs) of the time. using that number i figure it to be 764,430 to 1.                                   #14     14th June 2009, 9:38 AM           JulieK [118]                     re: Poker & Set over set over set, what are the odds?

You know in Hard Rock casino ... you would be celebrating because you would get something like !$200 000 -$300 000 bad beat jackpot. Last time i was there it was like 500k .If your Quads or better get beat you get half of the jackpot and the rest of the table gets to split the other half.  You have to have a pair in your hand and i believe Quads have to be higher than 4's or 5's ..something like that.

In this case, certainly one of the more rare happenings.  Can't recall ever seeing one, and don't think I would care to. What are the odds that 'I' would have the bottom set. HMmmm ... that wouldn't be so bad I guess if I could hit my quads on the river.  One step further, what are the odds that 2 of the sets could be quads by showdown, and which sets would they be?

I held 10's in the hole and was against AK. On the flop....K, 10, 10. Ok I check, call the big bet, actually called by another player. next card....K. Hmmm, I should slowplay anyway right? Call another big bet. River....K. Wow, now I'm just pretty amazed at that, I have to fold to his bet. However someone else actually called him down with A9....but it was SUITED so I can't blame him (hehe). Obviously he lost to the 4 K's, and no one believed me when I told them I folded quad 10's...they just laughed. I took a screen shot so I'll definitely post it sometime.                                   #11     9th April 2008, 2:04 AM           bustme [270]                     Wow,.,.Many other people who have lost with four of a kind before...........  One of the last hands I played in NL25 on pokerstars I got 10 10, one person raise preflop to 1 dollar 2 other guys called and me....

The odds that you'll get beat are long - very long.  If you play enough hands over enough years, it'll happen to you though.  More than once, if you play long enough.  Kyle is right too, you'll likely encounter it more in a game like Omaha or Stud.                                   #14     9th April 2008, 2:15 AM           jvtelemark [28]         Online Poker at: Nordic Bet  Game: Holdem              re: Poker & Is losing with four of a kind a once in a lifetime experience?

Depends how you have been playing before hands, a few weeks ago I had been limping in and chacking everytime I missed for awhile so the flop came 99 and something I can't remember, guy got pissed next to me, raised half his stack, I reraised all in and he called with A2.                                   #19     9th April 2008, 1:30 PM              Likminutz [851]         Game: NLHE                    Originally Posted by F Paulsson   Without even knowing exactly what happened, I can tell you that checking that flop is a significant leak.

Quads don't come around that often, but flopping monsters is not a rare occurrence. When the preflop action, as he described it, had "lots of action" then the idea of slowplaying the nuts on the flop in (what must be) a big pot is really bad.  For slowplaying to be right, the circumstances must be extraordinary. It's something that should be done very rarely. From the way he phrased it, it's clear to me that he thought of it as the default play, but even if specifically he doesn't, there's a ton of people who can't help themselves but to check when they flop monsters. And that IS a significant leak, no doubt. No matter what the situation is leading up to that hand.  As an aside, I've posted about this many times before, and with time I've become lazy and just post one-liners when I spot something that strikes me as a very basic beginner's mistake. I understand - and agree - that including reasoning makes the post more worthwhile, but I've noticed that I don't really have the energy to repeat the longer explanation posts unless specifically asked for it (like here).  I make one-line posts in two situations; one is where I simply don't have time to post more at that precise moment, and the other is where I find the reasoning to be standard and/or obvious. My previous post was the latter.                                   #22     9th April 2008, 6:28 PM           blindin1eye [20]         Online Poker at: ultimate bet  Game: holdem              i feel your pain twice last week had 4 9'S LOST TO THE STRAIT FLUSH BYE BYE $400                                   #23     10th April 2008, 6:15 PM              Likminutz [851]         Game: NLHE                    Originally Posted by F Paulsson   Quads don't come around that often, but flopping monsters is not a rare occurrence.

My previous post was the latter.         You contradict yourself, we were only talking about quads in one hand not all different "nuts."  You say slowplaying should be done very rarely...well quads are pretty rare.  I would say even if he bets out on this hand the outcome probably doesnt differ that much...although I agree with you as I now am aware that there was "lots" of preflop action, betting out is definitely the better move.  I just think he's still ending up broke however he plays this hand post flop.  Thanks for you insight though, hope I didn't piss you off for asking for an explanation.                                   #24     10th April 2008, 9:13 PM              F Paulsson [5,654]                           Originally Posted by Likminutz   You contradict yourself         No, I don't think I am. I'm possibly contradicting what you thought I meant.       You say slowplaying should be done very rarely...well quads are pretty rare.        Well, yes, but... I think you may have misunderstood me. I don't mean that slowplaying is something you should do "rarely" for the sake of doing it not often. Slowplaying should be done rarely because the conditions in which it is correct occurs so rarely. Having a monster is only one condition that needs to be met. The pot also needs to be small, your opponents need to be likely to fold if you bet, AND they need to have some reasonable chance to improve if you check. As in, you don't slowplay rarely just to make it a rare occurence, you slowplay rarely because the appropriate situation in which to slowplay presents itself so very rarely.

I just think he's still ending up broke however he plays this hand post flop.        Ah, yes. This I agree with completely. In fact, if he somehow manages to NOT get his whole stack in on this board, THAT shows a VERY significant leak.       Thanks for you insight though, hope I didn't piss you off for asking for an explanation.        Not at all. I'm not one to get easily pissed off, and as I said, I don't mind adding reasoning to my opinions if someone asks for it. Often, I don't need to explain myself, but when I do, I'm happy that someone calls me on it. Never be afraid to request that someone explains why they think something.

See All Sportsbook Reviews You are here Home » Four of a Kind Odds  Four of a Kind Odds  Facebook Twitter Reddit Getting four of a kind in Texas Hold’em won’t happen to you very often. You have roughly a 1 in 4,100 chance to hit this monster hand on the flop, but this big hand isn’t always the best way to get chips from your opponents. Hitting four of a kind means that the only hand in poker that can beat you is a straight flush. The odds of being up against a straight flush when you’ve hit four of a kind are over 1 in 88 million, and it’s unlikely that you’ll even see this happen — let alone be involved in a hand where it does occur. Just because you hit a big hand like four of a kind doesn’t mean that you’re going to win a big pot. In order for you to have four of a kind, there has to be at least two of your cards on the board, and more often there will be three of them with the community cards. Because you have all four of them, your opponents’ hands are going to be inferior, and when you have a big hand against a bunch of weak hands, it’s hard to get chips out of your opponents. They will see the likelihood of you having a big hand and will often get out of the way. The best way to play a monster hand like four of a kind is to let your opponents catch up a bit. You do this by not betting your big hand. That lets the other players in the hand improve and it makes them think that you don’t have very much, especially a monster like four of a kind. You want to induce the other players at the table to make a bet at the pot. If someone does, you should only call their bets, and only raise the action after the last card has been dealt out. That will give you the best chance to get paid on your four of a kind, otherwise your monster hand will be wasted and all you will win will be a small pot.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.    A full house from two pair on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your boat.    A flush from a four-flush on the next card = 4.22-to-1 (19.15%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards left of your suit to hit your flush.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw on the next card = 4.9-to-1 (17.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards left to hit your straight.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.8-to-1 (12.77%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 6 cards to hit your pair.    Flop to river     A full house or better from a set by the river = 1.99-to-1 (33.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((40/47)*(36/46))  EXPLANATION: There are 10 cards on the turn that will make you a full house. Assuming that you don't hit it on the turn, the turn card will add 3 more cards for you to hit your boat on the river.    A full house or better from two pair by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.5%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have four outs to hit your full house on either the turn on river.    A flush from a four-flush by the river = 1.86-to-1 (35.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((38/47)*(37/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one of the 9 flush cards either on the turn OR the river.    A backdoor flush by the river = 23.02-to-1 (4.16%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(10/47)*(9/46)  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 10 flush cards on the turn and hit one out of the 9 flush cards on the river.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw by the river = 2.18-to-1 (31.45%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((39/47)*(38/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 8 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.47%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 4 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A pair or better from two overcards by the river = 3.14-to-1 (24.14%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((41/47)*(40/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 6 cards that can make you a pair either on the turn or the river.    The river     A full house or better from a set = 3.6-to-1 (21.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/10)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 different cards to hit your boat and 1 card to hit quads.    A full house from two pair on the final card = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left that match your two pair.    A flush from a four-flush on the final card = 4.11-to-1 (19.6%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards to hit your pair.    An open-ended straight draw = 4.75-to-1 (17.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.    A gutshot straight draw = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.67-to-1 (13.0%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.    A full house from two pair on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your boat.    A flush from a four-flush on the next card = 4.22-to-1 (19.15%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards left of your suit to hit your flush.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw on the next card = 4.9-to-1 (17.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards left to hit your straight.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.8-to-1 (12.77%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 6 cards to hit your pair.    Flop to river     A full house or better from a set by the river = 1.99-to-1 (33.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((40/47)*(36/46))  EXPLANATION: There are 10 cards on the turn that will make you a full house. Assuming that you don't hit it on the turn, the turn card will add 3 more cards for you to hit your boat on the river.    A full house or better from two pair by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.5%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have four outs to hit your full house on either the turn on river.    A flush from a four-flush by the river = 1.86-to-1 (35.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((38/47)*(37/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one of the 9 flush cards either on the turn OR the river.    A backdoor flush by the river = 23.02-to-1 (4.16%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(10/47)*(9/46)  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 10 flush cards on the turn and hit one out of the 9 flush cards on the river.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw by the river = 2.18-to-1 (31.45%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((39/47)*(38/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 8 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.47%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 4 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A pair or better from two overcards by the river = 3.14-to-1 (24.14%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((41/47)*(40/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 6 cards that can make you a pair either on the turn or the river.    The river     A full house or better from a set = 3.6-to-1 (21.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/10)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 different cards to hit your boat and 1 card to hit quads.    A full house from two pair on the final card = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left that match your two pair.    A flush from a four-flush on the final card = 4.11-to-1 (19.6%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards to hit your pair.    An open-ended straight draw = 4.75-to-1 (17.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.    A full house from two pair on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your boat.    A flush from a four-flush on the next card = 4.22-to-1 (19.15%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards left of your suit to hit your flush.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw on the next card = 4.9-to-1 (17.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards left to hit your straight.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.8-to-1 (12.77%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 6 cards to hit your pair.    Flop to river     A full house or better from a set by the river = 1.99-to-1 (33.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((40/47)*(36/46))  EXPLANATION: There are 10 cards on the turn that will make you a full house. Assuming that you don't hit it on the turn, the turn card will add 3 more cards for you to hit your boat on the river.    A full house or better from two pair by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.5%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have four outs to hit your full house on either the turn on river.    A flush from a four-flush by the river = 1.86-to-1 (35.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((38/47)*(37/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one of the 9 flush cards either on the turn OR the river.    A backdoor flush by the river = 23.02-to-1 (4.16%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(10/47)*(9/46)  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 10 flush cards on the turn and hit one out of the 9 flush cards on the river.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw by the river = 2.18-to-1 (31.45%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((39/47)*(38/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 8 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.47%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 4 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A pair or better from two overcards by the river = 3.14-to-1 (24.14%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((41/47)*(40/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 6 cards that can make you a pair either on the turn or the river.    The river     A full house or better from a set = 3.6-to-1 (21.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/10)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 different cards to hit your boat and 1 card to hit quads.    A full house from two pair on the final card = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left that match your two pair.    A flush from a four-flush on the final card = 4.11-to-1 (19.6%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards to hit your pair.    An open-ended straight draw = 4.75-to-1 (17.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.    A gutshot straight draw = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.67-to-1 (13.0%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

There is a very basic and practical Odds for Dummies at Cardschat that can help get you started before you delve into the mathematics below. As overwhelming as it may seem if you really want to take your poker game to a new level this is something you will need to study and get your arms around. Your decisions need to go beyond reads on your opponents, position and the cards you are dealt.  If youre also into sports betting for example you will find it useful to know your odds. Youll find further explanations and tips about odds when it comes to sports betting on Tippat.  To calculate the poker odds on your own, cut and paste the formula below into a spreadsheet.  Combinations     Different flop combinations = 19,600    MATH: =(50*49*48)/(3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many flop combinations there are with 50 cards left. There is a 1 in 50 chance of any particular card being the first flop card. There is a 1 in 49 chance of any particular card being the second flop card and a 1 in 48 chance of any particular card being the third flop card. Then we divide by 6 is because the order of the cards on the flop doesn't matter so any flops that have the same cards but in different order will be considered "duplicate" flops and will not be considered. There are six different ways that a set of 3 cards can be ordered. Either of the 3 cards can be the first card. Then only 2 cards can be the 2nd card and only 1 card can be the last card (3*2*1=6).    Different board combinations = 2,118,760    MATH: =(50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1)  EXPLANATION: This is when you are dealt 2 cards and want to know how many board combinations there are with 50 cards left. Following up on the logic from the last example, there are (50+49+48+47+46) different board combinations but like the last example we want to ignore duplicate combinations where you have the same cards but in different order.    Pre-flop   The probability of being dealt:    Pocket aces = 220-to-1 (0.45%)    MATH: =(52/4)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace are 4 in 52. The odds of your second card being an Ace (given the fact that your first card was an Ace) are 3 in 51.    Either pocket aces or pocket kings = 109.5-to-1 (0.91%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of the first card being dealt to you being an Ace or a King are 8 in 52 (4 Aces and 4 Kings). The odds of your second card being the same as your first card are 3 in 51.    Any pocket pair = 16-to-1 (5.88%)    MATH: =(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The key to the equation here is to realize that to calculate the odds of getting ANY pocket pair is that it doesn't matter what your first card is. It just matters that your second card matches your first. After getting your first card, there are only 3 cards out of the 51 left that will match your first card.    AK suited = 330.5-to-1 (0.3%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/1)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace or King is 8 in 52. Then, there is only one card out of the 51 cards left in the deck that can make you a suited big slick.    AK offsuit = 109.5-to-1 (0.9%)    MATH: =(52/8)*(51/3)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 3 out of 51.    AK suited or offsuit = 81.88-to-1 (1.21%)   or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/4)  EXPLANATION: The odds of your first card being an Ace of a King are 8 in 52. The odds of your other card are 4 out of 51.    Any two suited cards = 3.25-to-1 (23.53%)    MATH: =(51/12)  EXPLANATION: It doesn't matter what your first card is. After you get your first card, there will only be 12 cards out of the 51 cards left that will be the same suit as your first.    Either pocket aces, pocket kings or AK = 46.36-to-1 (2.11%)   or or  MATH: =(52/8)*(51/7)  EXPLANATION: This is a useful calculation to know if you are getting deep into a tournament and need to double up and want to wait for a really good hand. There are 8 Aces or Kings you can get as your first card. After that, there are 7 Aces or Kings left out of 51 cards.    Pocket Pairs     Flopping a set = 8.28-to-1 (10.8%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads, which is 48 out of the remaining 49 cards. The 3rd flop card can be any card other than a card that gives you quads OR that matches the 2nd flop card to give you a full house, which is 44 out of 48 remaining cards. Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that hitting the set can happen (hitting your set on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd flop card). As a side note, there is a common misperception that the odds of flopping a set are 7.5-to-1. Technically, this is not true because this calculation includes the odds of hitting a full house with your set (which is no longer a set).    Flopping a full house = 135.1-to-1 (0.73%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((2/50)*(48/49)*(3/48))*3  EXPLANATION: A card that matches your set has a 2 out of 50 chance of coming out. The next card can be any card other than a card that will make you quads (48 out  49 cards). The 3rd flop card has to match the 2nd flop card, (3 out of 48 cards). Then you multiply by 3 to take into account the 3 different ways that you can hit the full house. It should be noted that we are not including the probability of the flop being all the same cards, which gives you a full house without hitting the flop.    Flopping quads = 407.33-to-1 (0.245%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(2/50)*(1/49)*(48/48) + (48/50)*(2/49)*(1/48) + (2/50)*(48/49)*(1/48)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (2 out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as your pocket pair (1 out of 49). The third card can be any other card (48 out of 48). Then we multiply by 3 since there are 3 different combinations of ways to hit the quads.    Flopping a set or better = 7.51-to-1 (11.76%)   MATH: =1-((48/50)*(47/49)*(46/48))  EXPLANATION: Sometimes it's easier to calculate the odds of the opposite. Here, I calculate the odds of NOT flopping a set and subtract it from 100%. To calculate the odds of not flopping a set, all the cards on the flop can't have the same rank as your pocket pair. For the first card there are 48 out of 50 cards that won't hit your set. For the second card there are 47 out of 49 cards and for the third card there are 46 out of 48 cards that won't hit your set. This probability gives you the oft-quoted 7.5-to-1 odds.    With 2 suited cards     Flopping a flush = 0.84% (117.79-to-1)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/11)*(49/10)*(48/9)  EXPLANATION: There are 13 cards of each suit. Assuming you have 2 suited cards then there are only 11 cards left of that suit and only 50 total cards left in the deck. The probability of the first flop card being of your suit is 11 in 50. Then the second card 10 in 49 and then the last card 9 in 48.    Flopping a flush draw = 8.14-to-1 (10.9%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(10/49)*(39/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card and a 10-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card being a flush card. Then there is a 39-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 different possible flops with 2 of the flush cards.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw (3 flush cards) = 1.4-to-1 (41.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(11/50)*(39/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There is a 11-in-50 chance of the first flop card being a flush card. There is a 39-in-49 chance of the 2nd flop card NOT being a flush card. Then there is a 38-in-48 chance of the third flop card NOT being a flush card. Then we multiply by 3 to adjust for the number of possible different flops where there is only 1 flush card.    Making a flush by the river = 14.6-to-1 (6.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =((COMBIN(11,3)*COMBIN(39,2)) + (COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1)) + (COMBIN(11,5)))/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 3 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios - having the board show 3 of the flush suit, 4 of the flush suit, or 5 of the flush suit. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations. Note: some of the flushes may be straight flushes.    With 2 unsuited cards     Flopping a flush draw = 43.55-to-1 (2.2%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/24)*(49/11)*(48/10)  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card is the same suit as the other flop cards is 10 in 48.    Flopping a backdoor flush draw = 2.91-to-1 (25.6%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(24/50)*(11/49)*(38/48)*3  EXPLANATION: There are only 12 cards left of each suit that you hold. The probability of the first flop card being of either of your suits is 24 in 50. The chances that the second flop card is the same suit as the first flop card is 11 in 49. The chance that the third flop card NOT being the same suit as the other flop cards is 38 in 48. We then multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique combinations of flops can contain 2 out of 3 of your suit.    Making a flush by the river = 78.46-to-1 (1.26%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(((COMBIN(11,4)*COMBIN(39,1))+(COMBIN(11,5)))*2)/((50*49*48*47*46)/(5*4*3*2*1))  EXPLANATION: We add up the 2 possible mutually-exclusive scenarios where the board shows 4 of the flush suit or 5 of the flush suit. Then we multiply that by 2 since we are holding 2 different suits which can fop a flush draw. Then we divide this sum by the total number of possible board combinations.    With 2 non-pair cards     Flopping at least a pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.1-to-1 (32.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((44/50)*(43/49)*(42/48))  EXPLANATION: Without possible straights and flushes, the only possible way to flop a pair or better is to have the flop hit your hand. So, I calculated the odds of the flop missing you and subtracting it from 100%. The odds of each flop card missing your pocket cards are 44-in-50, 43-in-49, and 42-in-48, respectively.    Exactly one pair (using your pocket cards) = 2.45-to-1 (29.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(44/49)*(43/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting you is 6-in-50. The chances of the second and third cards missing you are 44-in-49 and 43-in-48, respectively. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where exactly 1 card matches the pocket cards.    Two pair (using both of your pocket cards) = 48.49-to-1 (2.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(3/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances of the second hitting your OTHER pocket card is 3-in-49. The chances of the third flop card missing you is 44-in-48. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop 2 pair using both of your pocket cards.    Trips = 73.24-to-1 (1.3%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =((6/50)*(2/49)*(44/48))*3  EXPLANATION: The chances of the first flop card hitting either of your pocket cards is 6-in-50. The chances that the second flop card will match the first is 2-in-49. The chances that the third flop card will miss your pocket card sis 44-in-48. We multiply by 3 because there are 3 unique flop combinations where you can flop trips.    A full house = 1,088-to-1 (.09%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(3/50)*(2/49)*(3/48)*6  EXPLANATION: The first card has to match one of your hole cards (3 out of 50). The second has to make you trips (2 out of 49). And the third has to match your other card (3 out of 48). Then we multiply by 6 because there are 6 different combinations of flops to flop the full house.    Quads = 9,799-to-1 (.01%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(50/6)*(49/2)*(48/1)  EXPLANATION: The first flop card has to be of the same rank as one of the 2 cards you hold (6 cards out of 50). The second flop card has to be the same as the first flop card (2 out of 49). The last flop card is the only card left out of 48 of the same rank as the other two flop cards.    Odds that the flop will be:     Three of a kind = 424-to-1 (0.24%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/3)*(50/2)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same rank as the first. After the first card comes on the flop there are only 3 cards of that rank left and the odds of the second flop card being the same rank as the first are 3 in 51. Then the odds of the third flop card being the same rank as the first two are 2 in 50.    A pair = 4.9-to-1 (16.94%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(3/51)*(48/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card has to match the first, and the third card can be any card other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    Three suited cards = 18.3-to-1 (5.18%)    Flop  MATH: =(51/12)*(50/11)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first flop card is - only that the second and third flop cards have the same suit as the first card. After the first card is dealt there is only 12 cards left of that suit. After the turn there are only 11 cards left of that suit.    Two suited cards = .82-to-1 (55.1%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(12/51)*(39/50)*3  EXPLANATION: The first card can be any card, the second card's suit has to match the first, and the third card's suit can be any suit other than the 2 cards that match the first two. Then we multiply by 3 because there are 3 ways for the flop to pair.    No suited cards = 1.5-to-1 (39.8%)    Flop  MATH: =(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)  EXPLANATION: Your pocket cards are ignored so we start with 52 cards. It doesn't matter what the first card on the flop is - only that the other two flop cards don't match the suit of the others. When the second card comes it has to be one of the 3 other suits (13 cards of each suit) than the first flop card. So that's 39 cards out of 51. Then the third flop card needs to be one of the 2 suits that hasn't been flopped yet. So that is 26 cards out of 50.    Three cards in sequence = 28-to-1 (3.5%)    Flop    Two cards in sequence = 1.5-to-1 (40%)    Flop    No cards in sequence = .8-to-1 (56%)    Flop    The turn     A full house or better from a set on the next card = 5.7-to-1 (14.89%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/7)  EXPLANATION: There are 6 cards to make a full house and 1 card to make you quads.    A full house from two pair on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your boat.    A flush from a four-flush on the next card = 4.22-to-1 (19.15%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards left of your suit to hit your flush.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw on the next card = 4.9-to-1 (17.02%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards left to hit your straight.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw on the next card = 10.8-to-1 (8.51%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.8-to-1 (12.77%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(47/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 6 cards to hit your pair.    Flop to river     A full house or better from a set by the river = 1.99-to-1 (33.4%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((40/47)*(36/46))  EXPLANATION: There are 10 cards on the turn that will make you a full house. Assuming that you don't hit it on the turn, the turn card will add 3 more cards for you to hit your boat on the river.    A full house or better from two pair by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.5%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have four outs to hit your full house on either the turn on river.    A flush from a four-flush by the river = 1.86-to-1 (35.0%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((38/47)*(37/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one of the 9 flush cards either on the turn OR the river.    A backdoor flush by the river = 23.02-to-1 (4.16%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =(10/47)*(9/46)  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 10 flush cards on the turn and hit one out of the 9 flush cards on the river.    A straight from an open-ended straight draw by the river = 2.18-to-1 (31.45%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((39/47)*(38/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 8 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A straight from a gutshot straight draw by the river = 5.07-to-1 (16.47%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((43/47)*(42/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 4 straight cards either on the turn or the river.    A pair or better from two overcards by the river = 3.14-to-1 (24.14%)     Hand Flop  MATH: =1-((41/47)*(40/46))  EXPLANATION: You have to hit one out of the 6 cards that can make you a pair either on the turn or the river.    The river     A full house or better from a set = 3.6-to-1 (21.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/10)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 different cards to hit your boat and 1 card to hit quads.    A full house from two pair on the final card = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards left that match your two pair.    A flush from a four-flush on the final card = 4.11-to-1 (19.6%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/9)  EXPLANATION: You have 9 cards to hit your pair.    An open-ended straight draw = 4.75-to-1 (17.4%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/8)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.    A gutshot straight draw = 10.5-to-1 (8.7%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/4)  EXPLANATION: You have 4 cards to hit your straight.    A pair from two overcards = 6.67-to-1 (13.0%)     Hand Board  MATH: =(46/6)  EXPLANATION: You have 8 cards to hit your straight.

Suppose we have 77 and we are playing 9-handed. First we have to make sure that none of our opponents has a 7, because otherwise flopping quads is impossible. So the 16 cards dealt to our opponents must have come from the 48 cards remaining in the deck that are not sevens. (48 choose 16)/(50 choose 16) is (34x33)/(50x49) or about 0.458. Disregarding the order in which the flop cards are chosen, there is only one way to choose both sevens out of the 34 remaining cards in the deck, and the third flop card can be any one of 32. So there are 32/(34x33x32) flops that will give us quads, or 1 in 1056. So we will flop quads with a pocket pair only 13 times in 30,000 hands.

Fri Jan 28, 2005, 02:58 AM       I was recently playing in a cash game. (9 handed game) I had ace/9 offsuit on the button. The flop came down ace,ace,ace. My next hand on the button I had 6/7 suited flop came down 6,6,6. Now I know the odds of flopping quads with one in the hole is .01%. I was trying to figure out the odds of it happening twice in 9 hands. I am not sure how to calculate it in percentage and or odds such as 8900 to 1 4000 to 2. Can anyone help me figure this out and if so please explain how to calculate.  Thanks          Tags:  None                    Previous  Next                         Working...

First, both players have to have a pocket pair for this to happen.  Let's call that XX and YY.   In order to get quads and FH the flop has to be XXY or YYX.  The chance of either is the same so we can find the chance of one and double it.  There are 2 possible Xs out of 48 cards for the first card then 1 possible X out of 47 then 2 possibly Ys out of 46  So the chance for hitting XXY should be 2/48 * 1/47 * 2/46 = 1/25944  But as I mentioned there are 2 different ways for this to happen, so that would be 1/12972                    RustyBrooks   View Public Profile  Send a private message to RustyBrooks  Find More Posts by RustyBrooks  Find Threads Started by RustyBrooks                     02-21-2013, 04:02 PM   # 3       sixhigh    ϡ       Join Date: Oct 2005  Posts: 2,259         Re: Odds of flopping a full house vs quads      You cannot just multiply the odds as those are not independent events.  If two players hold a pocket pair, for example Jc Jd vs. Qc Qd there are 4 flops which give one player a full house and the other player quads: Js Jh Qh; Js Jh Qs, Js Qh Qs, Jh Qh Qs.  In total there are choose(48;3) = 17296 flops possible.  Thus the probability of one player hitting quads and the other hitting a boat given both players start with a pocket pair is 4 / 17296 = 1 / 4324 = 0.023%.      Quote:    So the chance for hitting XXY should be 2/48 * 1/47 * 2/46 = 1/25944    You have to multiply that with 3! = 6 because the order of the cards on the flop does not matter.  Or, in other words, there are not 2 different ways for this to happen, but 6: XXY, XYX, YXX, YYX, YXY, XYY.

My way finds the chance of XXY happening but it could actually be XXY XYX YXX so I was off by a factor of 3.  Factoring that in, I get 6/25944 which is 1/4324                    RustyBrooks   View Public Profile  Send a private message to RustyBrooks  Find More Posts by RustyBrooks  Find Threads Started by RustyBrooks                     02-21-2013, 04:17 PM   # 5       camz2895    Carpal \'Tunnel    Join Date: Apr 2006  Location: Lafayette, LA  Posts: 7,246        So you should expect to see this occurrence in every 4300 hands or every 4300 pocket pairs you are dealt?                    camz2895   View Public Profile  Send a private message to camz2895  Find More Posts by camz2895  Find Threads Started by camz2895                     02-21-2013, 04:31 PM   # 6       RustyBrooks    Carpal \'Tunnel       Join Date: Feb 2006  Location: Austin, TX  Posts: 23,428         Re: Odds of flopping a full house vs quads        Quote:     Originally Posted by camz2895    So you should expect to see this occurrence in every 4300 hands or every 4300 pocket pairs you are dealt?

For specifically you getting the full house and the other guy getting quads, it's 1 in 8648 which is just 2/C(48,3).

Multiplying was fine for the probability of XXY even though the cards are not independent since he's multiplying conditional probabilities.  P(XXY) = P(X)*P(X|X)*P(Y|XX)  2/48 * 1/47 * 2/46.  He just has to multiply that by 3 since there are 3 mutually exclusive outcomes with this probability (XXY,XYX, YXX).  That gives the probability that specifically you flop the full house while the other player flops quads.      Last edited by BruceZ; 02-21-2013 at 05:21 PM .

Albeit the probability is tiny.  On a heads up table you should expect this event to happen once every  2,501,314 hands if both players never fold pocket pairs preflop. The probability is given by this formula:    The first fraction accounts for the probability of a paired flop (roughly 17%), the second fraction for one player having a matching pair to flop a boat and the third fraction for the other player having a matching pair to flop quads.                    sixhigh   View Public Profile  Send a private message to sixhigh  Find More Posts by sixhigh  Find Threads Started by sixhigh                     02-21-2013, 07:55 PM   # 12       Sherman    Carpal \'Tunnel       Join Date: Jun 2005  Location: Psychology Department  Posts: 7,764         Re: Odds of flopping a full house vs quads        Quote:     Originally Posted by sixhigh    Albeit the probability is tiny.

Well yeah, if you make the most difficult situation to see this (i.e., heads up play). The fact is that these hands probably happen every day. It is just on some days that someone decides to report it here.

And the chance to have two players with pocket pairs at a 9-player table is much higher than the chance at heads-up.  Heads up it happens once in 285 deals.  At a full table it happens about 1 in 6.  So maybe 47 times as often, and that's not counting the times we have 3 or more pairs dealt.

The chance of  quads vs. full house is exactly 36 times as often as the heads up value of 1 in 1.25 million.  The chance that you get the full house and someone else makes quads is exactly 8 times the heads up value of 1 in 2.5 million.

I estimated it at just over 16%.     It's actually 9.5%.  You know in your head that it has to be less than 12.6% because your  1 in 285 was right, but we know for 9 players it must happen less than C(9,2) times more often because that would be the probability if the C(9,2) pairs of players were mutually exclusive.  So 12.6% overestimates the probability by over counting the cases where multiple pairs of players have pairs.  We also know that it has to be less than 11.9% because it must be less than  1 - [1 - 78*73/C(52,2)/C(50,2)]^C(9,2) = 11.9%  by the independence approximation.  It must be less than this because when 2 players don't have pocket pairs, it becomes more likely that the remaining pairs of players also don't have pocket pairs.  In fact, both of these 2 upper bounds are very loose, and the exact answer is 9.5% as I showed in this thread by generalized inclusion-exclusion.  Note that it is generalized because we want 2 or more players, so each line is multiplied by coefficients that come from the 2nd diagonal of Pascal's triangle (just 1,2,3....).  EDIT:  See later post for simple approximation that gives 9.67%.  If you just wanted the probability of quads vs. full house, you don't need the probability that 2 players have pairs because you can consider the flop first.  That makes the calculation much easier because then you don't have to worry about the cases where multiple pairs of players can have pairs.

If its not too much to ask, could you provide short  explanations for the R code lines that are not obvious.  For example, how does the while(1) {  work  how does the program know when to end the simulation?  And what does the F stand for in the sample(deck, 2*players, F) code  I guess the If statement may take a few extra lines of explanation.

Then if the 99.9% confidence interval is too wide when you stop it, the program can be restarted from the main while loop by highlighting everything from while(1) until the end, right clicking, and selecting "Run line or selection".  That will allow it to continue from where it left off, so you can run as many trials as you need.  F means sample without replacement.  T means sample with replacement.  The If line just compares the first 9 cards dealt to the second 9 cards dealt (1 to 10, 2 to 11, ...9 to 18) and sums the number of these where both cards are the same rank.  If there are 2 or more pairs, it increments a counter.  You can get help on any R function at the command prompt by typing ? followed by the function name.

It was assumed that the players already had the pocket pairs.  Without that assumption, yes it is much less frequent. But your calculation for Hero & someone else getting pocket pair in 6max is wrong. I'll fix it now in an edit.  Oh, furthermore, if more than one villain gets a unique PP then there are more flops that would make it happen. So we can't just use the probability that at least one villain gets a unique pocket pair; to be really exact, we have to make several calculations -- one for each exact number of villains having unique PP's.  I know I know, insert kindergarten humor.  Eh I'm working on something else atm so I'll return to this later or you /someone else can take a stab.

As the title of the thread says, I was wondering if anyone knew how to calculate the odds of flopping quads two hands in a row, because it happened to me about half an hour ago.  In the first hand I was BB and was dealt 2 4 off, and there were no raises preflop. The flop was all 2's. Unfortunately it checked all the way to the end, and there were five others involved in the hand. So no money made there.  In the second hand I was SB and was dealt pocket 9's. No one raised preflop, and I elected to not raise either. The flop was 9 7 9. This hand checked all the way as well, with three other people involved.  So while it's awesome I flopped back to back quads, it sucks I got zero action/profit on them.

Copy/paste: "odds of flopping quads" 2. Square that result 3. Raise 99 pre  Strictly speaking you should also factor in how likely you are to see a flop too.  Approx answer is 407^2 * 5 (if 20% VPiP)                    MeleaB   View Public Profile  Send a private message to MeleaB  Find More Posts by MeleaB  Find Threads Started by MeleaB                     03-23-2016, 06:30 PM   # 3       MadStranger    grinder    Join Date: Apr 2011  Location: Vancouver, Canada  Posts: 450         Re: Odds of Flopping Quads Two Hands in a Row      1 in 407 are the odds of flopping quads with a pocket pair. Without a pocket pair the odds are about 1 in 9799. So, if we know that the first hand is unpaired and the second is paired, the answer is 1 in 407*9799*whatever factor accounts for seeing the flop. So I'd say less than 1 in 10 million.

I once flopped quads back to back in a Holdem' poker tournament... pocket 99s in one hand, and then pocket 88s the very next hand. Both flopped quads, and both got paid-off, which is almost as unlikely . Anyhow, what are the odds of something like that happening? I would think they have to be pretty miniscule.                    akashenk   View Public Profile  Send a private message to akashenk  Find More Posts by akashenk  Find Threads Started by akashenk                     03-30-2015, 11:54 PM   # 2       GoFLOPyourself    enthusiast    Join Date: Jun 2014  Location: Casually adrift within.

Based upon the following info provided by statmanhal in a previous post of mine    Quote:     Originally Posted by statmanhal    Given a pair,the probability of flopping quads is C(2,2)*48/C(50,3) = 0.24%. The probability of getting a pair is 1/17. The probability of getting a pair AND then flopping quads is 0.24%/17 = 0.00014.     I am going to guess that the odds of flopping quads with a pair in your hand is 1 in 100 Million.  Of course, the likelihood that I am wrong is very high, so I look forward to seeing how others approach the question.

Posts: 67         Odds of flopping 3 or 4 Four of a kinds ?      A few years ago in a smoke filled half drunk garage game, the following scenario happened, and I've wondered the odds ever since.  Over the course of approximately 120 hands, I was dealt pocket pairs 3 times where I flopped quads (To the best of my recollection.) Each other player except one swear it was 4 times.  Nice thing was I took everyone of them to showdown and won some pots.  Given that we were 6 handed that night, what is the probability of flopping quads with a pocket pair 3 and 4 times. I have no idea where to start with the math other than multiplying the odds of flopping one 4 of a kind, but have no idea how to include the 120 hands.

Given a pair,the probability of flopping quads is C(2,2)*48/C(50,3) = 0.24%. The probability of getting a pair is 1/17. The probability of getting a pair AND then flopping quads is 0.24%/17 = 0.00014.  Now, to answer questions of this type, the question has to be precisely stated.  Do we assume the probability that exactly 3 or 3 or more pairs have occurred, or do we include the probability of getting exactly 3  or 3+ pairs, etc. In other words, what is given and what is to be calculated?  I’ll answer the question as follows. In 120 hands, you can expect to be dealt 7 pairs What is the probability that you flop quads at least 3 times given 7 pairs?. The binomial distribution provides the answer as 1.04682E-10 = 0.0000000001 or 1 in 10 billion times.  Could you all have been too drunk to remember exactly what happened.  NOTE; The above focuses on a specific player. For 6 players, the probability that at least one gets 3 or more quads is approximately 6 times the above answer. Still not big enough to not question the liquour holding capacity of all IMO.                    statmanhal   View Public Profile  Send a private message to statmanhal  Find More Posts by statmanhal  Find Threads Started by statmanhal                     12-19-2014, 07:53 PM   # 3       GoFLOPyourself    enthusiast    Join Date: Jun 2014  Location: Casually adrift within.

Still not big enough to not question the liquour holding capacity of all IMO.     Thanks statmanhal, I appreciate the help, and the inquiry into our state of drunkenness on the night in question.  (No sarcasm) I'd be one to question the recollection of such an event myself given the manner in which I introduced the story, and the odds of it being true.  I calculated the odds in a caveman way and they always end up making the odds of winning tho lottery look like a sure thing, almost..  I can unequivocally state the following; I myself was not inebriated anywhere close to the point of smearing or marring my recollection of the night.  I am a very occasional lightweight, drinking only a few times per year.  The others, excluding one, where quite inebriated and I believe this is what leads them to recall that it was actually 4 four of a kinds, not 3 as I have always recalled.  I have a very reliable witness who was completely sober on the night in question.  Here are the important details:  We played approximately 120 hands.  In three of those hands I was dealt a pocket pair (KK, JJ, 22).  On those particular hands I flopped the 4 of a kind.  I was the only one who got a four of a kind that night.  To answer your second paragraph question, I dealt other pocket pairs that did not quad on the flop.  So we'd be calculating probability that 3 or more pairs have occurred, but only 3 of them completed.  That corresponds with the way you calculated it, I believe.    Any other questions or clarifications I am happy to provide.

The reference to drinking was really said in jest. We get questions like yours all the time about very unlikely events occurring. One in 10 billion is obviously a very very unlikely event, but when many billions of hands are played every year, such events happen more than one expects.  It's just when they happen to you that makes them really remarkable.                    statmanhal   View Public Profile  Send a private message to statmanhal  Find More Posts by statmanhal  Find Threads Started by statmanhal                    12-20-2014, 12:36 AM   # 5       GoFLOPyourself    enthusiast    Join Date: Jun 2014  Location: Casually adrift within.  Posts: 67         Re: Odds of flopping 3 or 4 Four of a kinds ?      Well, what you state is very true.  In fact, I'll often ask people if they think they've ever shuffled a deck of cards so that the order of the 52 shuffled cards matches a shuffle they performed previously sometime in their life.  Some people think they have, but most, knowing me and the questions I ask, usually say no.  I'll then ask, what if I include all the shuffles of all the people you've ever played cards with?  Here I get a 50/50 split, where some will say yes, some will stick on no. Then I'll include all the people they've ever played with, plus all the people those people have ever played with, and at this point, most are willing to wager there has been a duplicate. If they stick on no, I'll ask, if we include every shuffle, since playing cards where invented, and every shuffle that's ever been made, if there has ever been a duplicate and most are now willing to consider the possibility.  Of course, the above is very unlikely in that there are something like 80 trillion trillion trillion billion million combinations that the deck can be shuffled in.  That makes the chance look infinitesimally small and very unlikely.  It does make my 1 in 10 billion look trillions and trillions of times more likely to happen than that, but still very unlikely.  I guess the whole point here is that many events in poker are just that, very unlikely, but given the fact that billions and billions of hands are played, this kind of thing indeed does happen, as you stated, just seeming special when we are involved with them.  Though in fact, if you took any two shuffles you've ever played with and asked the odds of having one shuffle followed by the next shuffle, those odds would be huge.  Even the odds of any shuffle are 80 trillion trillion... to 1.  Of course, the shuffle must end somewhere.  I knew the odds of my flopped 4 of a kinds was large, but had to idea it'd be out of the hundreds of millions to 1.  I always told people that I was probably more likely to win the lottery, but never could give a real number.  Thanks for providing the math.  I am looking to take a math course in the new year to try and start understanding probability, or at least how to begin calculating them.  ...  A few related points to how the cards unfolded.  On the very first hand played that night, I was dealt JJ.  A friend of mine in early position made it 3x to go.  I thought it was too small a raise in this game to be anything very good so I 3 bet him, to which he shoved.  I guess a fold could be in order here, but this was a few years before I knew such things.  My brother dealt the flop.  J in the window, and one more when he fanned it out.  Later, another player joined the game, and of the lot of us I'd venture to say he was the best player at the table.  I was dealt deuces against him.  Flopped quads and went to showdown.  He was amazed and talking about the odds of flopping the hand.  Over the drunkenness permeating the room, it was conveyed that it was the second time it had happened.  Flash forward about four hours later, and we were playing the last hand before the end of re-buys; it was getting late.  The board paired Kings, and to my amazement, the four players in front of me were all going all in, probably figuring if they lost they could re-buy, and they were mostly under a full stack anyway.  After a few minutes of them making side pots, I whispered to my brother "Guess what I got?' and it was half heard by the room, at which point I flipped them over, pocket Kings, and pandemonium erupted.    Thanks again for taking the time to consider the answer. Appreciate it.

There are 48 x 47 x 46 possible flops = 103,776 There are 4 x 3 x 2 possible flops using only case cards = 24  So the probability is 24 divided by 103776 = about 4300 to 1.  ------------------------  To verify:  We know that flopping quads is about 400 to 1 if holding a pair. Well the odd card must match the card in the other players hand... there are only two of them and 46 unknown cards so it's about a 1 in 23 shot.  Multiple the 1 in 23 shot by the 1 in 400 shot and you get about a 1 in 9200. Now we halve this (as we have two players who can do it) so that's about 4600 to 1... which is close to what we got above.  ------------------------  Caveat: Friday + Tired + No access to calculator = High Chance of Error                    hepzebah   View Public Profile  Send a private message to hepzebah  Find More Posts by hepzebah  Find Threads Started by hepzebah                     10-29-2010, 12:11 PM   # 3       bachfan    adept    Join Date: Nov 2005  Location: Colorado  Posts: 888         Re: Odds of flopped quads over flopped full house        Quote:     Originally Posted by VpBob    In 9 handed hold'em, what are the odds that one player flops quads while another flops a full house at the same time, each having been dealt a pocket pair.

Another chance to pimp my new tool at http://propokertools.com/pql   If we narrow the problem to say 'how often do two players in hold'em who are dealt pocket pairs flop one full house and one quads', then we get 0.02 select count(handshaving(exactHandType, flop, quads) = 1 and handshaving(exactHandType, flop, fullhouse) = 1) from game='holdem', p1='AA-22', p2='AA-22' Results: Trials 	COUNT 1 600000 	129 (0.02%)  If we ask 'how often with nine random holdem hands does one player have quads and another have a full house'  we get a similar number. select count(handshaving(exactHandType, flop, quads) = 1 and handshaving(exactHandType, flop, fullhouse) = 1) from game='holdem', p1='**', p2='**', p3='**', p4='**', p5='**', p6='**', p7='**', p8='**', p9='**' Results: Trials 	COUNT 1 600000 	185 (0.03%)  The only problem with the above is that we have included flops that look like '3s3h3d' - without loss of generality, we can specify a flop with a pair which should give the correct answer: select count(handshaving(exactHandType, flop, quads) = 1 and handshaving(exactHandType, flop, fullhouse) = 1) from game='holdem', p1='**', p2='**', p3='**', p4='**', p5='**', p6='**', p7='**', p8='**', p9='**', board='AsAhTd' Results: Trials 	COUNT 1 600000 	97 (0.02%)  Or, equivalently, select count(handshaving(inRange, 'TT') = 1 and handshaving(inRange, 'AA') = 1) from game='holdem', p1='**', p2='**', p3='**', p4='**', p5='**', p6='**', p7='**', p8='**', p9='**', board='AsAhTd ' Results: Trials 	COUNT 1 600000 	92 (0.02%)                    bachfan   View Public Profile  Send a private message to bachfan  Find More Posts by bachfan  Find Threads Started by bachfan                    10-29-2010, 12:17 PM   # 4       statmanhal    Pooh-Bah    Join Date: Jan 2009  Posts: 4,063         Re: Odds of flopped quads over flopped full house      This confirms hepzebah's result using combinations.  For quads, 2 out of 2 cards have to flop. For the full house, the third flop card has to be 1 of 2 remaining of the rank held by other player. So, for player A to have quads and player B to have a full house,  Pr = C(2,2)*C(2,1)/C(48,3).  Since A can have the full house and B the quads, we double this to get Pr = 0.00231 or a 1 in 4324 chance.                    statmanhal   View Public Profile  Send a private message to statmanhal  Find More Posts by statmanhal  Find Threads Started by statmanhal                             Tweet           «  Previous Thread | Next Thread  »       Thread Tools        Show Printable Version   Email this Page       Display Modes        Linear Mode   Switch to Hybrid Mode   Switch to Threaded Mode                 Posting Rules       You may not post new threads  You may not post replies  You may not post attachments  You may not edit your posts   BB code is On  Smilies are On  [IMG] code is On  HTML code is Off   Forum Rules                      Forum Jump    User Control Panel  Private Messages  Subscriptions  Who's Online  Search Forums  Forums Home    Links to Popular Forums  News, Views, and Gossip  Beginners Questions  Marketplace & Staking  Casino & Cardroom Poker  Internet Poker  NL Strategy Forums  Poker Goals & Challenges  Las Vegas Lifestyle  Sporting Events  Politics  Other Other Topics  Two Plus Two  About the Forums  Two Plus Two Magazine Forum  The Two Plus Two Bonus Program  Two Plus Two Pokercast  The Best of Two Plus Two  Marketplace & Staking  Commercial Marketplace  General Marketplace  Staking - Offering Stakes  Staking  Staking - Offering Stakes  Staking - Seeking Stakes  Staking - Selling Shares - Online  Staking - Selling Shares - Live  Staking Rails  Transaction Feedback & Disputes  Transaction Feedback & Disputes  Coaching & Training  Coaching Advice  Cash Game Poker Coach Listings  Tournament/SNG Poker Coach Listings  Poker News & Discussion  News, Views, and Gossip  Poker Goals & Challenges  Poker Beats, Brags, and Variance  That's What She Said!

I'm having real trouble with having a starting pair and then flopping quads. According to charts, the probability of that happening is 0.25% or 400 to 1. I do not get this answer at all.  I managed to work out the probability the same as in the chart of a starting pair flopping a set (around 12% or 8 to 1). I'm assuming you have to combine the probability first of all of getting dealt a pair ([13C1][4C2]/[52C2]). I have no idea how to do it though. For the actual flop, I've tried numerous ways but it has all been in vain.  Can someone explain and demonstrate how exactly they calculate this as being 0.25%?  EDIT: Additional Information  In Texas Hold'Em Poker, you are dealt two cards to begin with. After some betting occurs, we see the "flop", which is three community cards dealt into the middle of the table that everyone can use towards making their poker hand. In this example, if you began with, for example, two Aces, and within the three cards in the "flop" there were the other two Aces, you would have "quads" (termed "flopping quads"). This could happen in another way too however. You could start with two random cards (not paired) and then the flop has the three other cards of one of your starting cards (example, you have are dealt an Ace and a King to start, and then there are three Kings in the flop). I'm specifically interested in starting with a pair and then the only other two cards of this rank in the remaining 50 cards coming out in the flop.  So there are 52 cards to begin; after you being dealt your 2 starting cards, there are 50 cards remaining from which three are taken to make the "flop".    binomial  theory  games     share | cite | improve this question      edited Oct 13 '16 at 19:06             asked Oct 13 '16 at 18:57       삼마패신암행어사   8 6              add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote  accepted      You are dealing with a Hypergeometric distribution. Rather than just quoting the formula, which you can check out yourself, let's derive how it applies in this particular case.  After having been dealt your two original cards, if they are a pair, you need 2 of the 3 cards on the flop to have the same value. Since there are 50 cards left to choose from, you have $\binom{50}{3}$ possible flops. How many of these will yield four of a kind? To answer this, notice that such a flop will have one "free" card (doesn't matter what it is) and two that must be there. So, if we restrict ourselves to flops that have the two cards we want, we are left with $\binom{48}{1}$ since we have removed the two matching cards and have to select one of the remaining 48.  Thus, the probability is $\frac{\binom{48}{1}}{\binom{50}{3}} = \frac{48}{\frac{50!}{3!47!}} = \frac{1}{50 \times 49 / 6} = \frac{3}{25 \times 49} \approx \frac{1}{408}$.  So, it's not exactly 1 in 400 but very close.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 13 '16 at 20:13       Josh Magarick   394 1 6                  +1: this is an exemplary explanation for its clarity and logical analysis. – whuber ♦  Oct 13 '16 at 21:09        add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Welcome to the poker odds calculator. Please supply the following four parameters:  Total: How many cards in the deck.  Drawn: How many cards we are drawing.  Outs: How many outs in the deck.  Required: How many outs are required (this many or more).

What are the chances of ...    ... being dealt pocket aces?  This is before hole cards are dealt, so all 52 cards are in the deck, so our Total Cards is 52.
We are looking for two aces in our hole cards. Since there are four aces in the
deck, we have 4 Outs. We are drawing 2 cards, and we need two of our 4 Outs. Outs: 4, Required Outs: 2, Cards Drawn: 2, Total Cards: 52 . The odds are 220:1 to be dealt Aces (or any specific pocket pair.) [see it]     ... flopping a set with any two paired cards?  Lets say we hold pocket 3's. We want another 3 on the flop. There are two more 3's in the
deck, so we have 2 outs. We need one of the remaining 3's on the flop to get
a set. There are three cards on the flop, so three cards will be drawn from a total
of 50 cards (we hold two of them in our hand already.) You have 7.5:1 odds of
flopping a set (or quads). [see it]     ... catching set by the river with any two paired cards?  Now we want to know, holding a given pocket pair, what are the chances of catching a set
by the river card. We are basically adding another two cards to our
number of cards drawn. You have 4.2:1 odds of catching a set (or quads). [see it]     ... flopping quads with any two paired cards?  We hold pocket 6's. What are the chances of flopping quads. There are two more 6's in the
deck (2 outs), we need both of them (required outs.) Three cards on the flop. You
have a 407:1 chance of flopping quads. [see it]     ... flopping boat with any two unpaired cards? (including quads)  Let's say you hold a 7 and 8. There are three more 7's and three more 8's in the deck, you need
three of those six outs on the flop. You have a 979:1 shot at it. [see it]     ... flopping flush with any two suited cards?  You hold two spades. There are 13 spades in the deck, so there are 11 left. To flop a flush,
we must hit three of our 11 outs on the flop. You have 118:1 shot at it. [see it]     ... catching flush by turn/river with four suited cards?  You hold two spades, and two more hit the flop. What are the chances of catching at least
one more? There are 9 more spades in the deck, we need one of them on the turn or river.
We are drawing 2 cards from the remaining 47 in the deck. You have a 1.9:1 chance to hit
one (or two) spades. [see it]     ... turning flush with four suited cards?  You hold two spades, and two more hit the flop. What are the chances of catching the flush
on the turn? There are 9 more spades in the deck, we need one of them.
We are drawing 1 card from the remaining 47 in the deck. You have a 4.2:1 chance. [see it]     ... rivering flush with four suited cards?  You hold two spades, and two more hit the flop. The turn missed. What are the chances of catching the flush
on the river? There are 9 more spades in the deck, we need one of them.
We are drawing 1 card from the remaining 46 in the deck. You have a 4.1:1 chance. [see it]     Keno Examples:    Pick 10, catch 6 or more  Pick 10 numbers, and catch 6 or more of them. There are always 20 numbers drawn out of 80.
You have a 75:1 shot at it. [see it]
