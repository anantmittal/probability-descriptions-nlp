                                    Vasectomy  Overview | How
            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

Vasectomy is a simple, safe procedure is designed to make a man permanently sterile, or unable to father a child. A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy—approximately 5 percent of all married men of reproductive age.  The percutaneous no-scalpel vasectomy is an improvement on a traditional vasectomy. An advanced technique to anesthetize (numb) the scrotum is used, and patients have less discomfort, fewer complications, and a quicker recovery. What's more, no skin stitches or sutures are needed.  Is a vasectomy 100 percent effective?  Other than total abstinence, no method of birth control is 100 percent effective. In rare cases after a vasectomy, it is possible for sperm to find its way across the void between the two blocked ends of the vas deferens. This generally occurs within the first few months after a vasectomy. However, the failure rate of vasectomy is very low. It has been used for many years as a means of sterilization and has a long track record as a safe and effective method of contraception.  If dead or live sperm continue to appear in the semen samples, or if sperm are discovered after a period of sterility, a repeat vasectomy will be necessary. Fortunately, this only happens approximately once in every 1,000 cases, a failure rate far less than for any other form of birth control.

            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

              THE MALE HEALTH CENTER, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS                                                  Vasectomy  Overview | How
            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.

          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.

          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

              THE MALE HEALTH CENTER, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS                                                  Vasectomy  Overview | How
            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

              THE MALE HEALTH CENTER, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS               Newsletter Vasectomy: Risks, Failure Rates, and Other Must-Knows Medically reviewed by Nicole Galan, RN on  February 11, 2016 — Written by Stephanie Watson Perhaps you’ve had enough children to make your family complete or you’ve decided parenthood isn’t for you. Either way, now you may want to find a birth control method you won’t have to worry about. One permanent birth control option for men is a vasectomy. During this procedure, your surgeon will cut a tube called the vas deferens to stop sperm from getting into the semen and reaching a woman’s body.  Vasectomy is more reliable at preventing pregnancy than any other birth control method. It’s also easier and cheaper than its female equivalent, which is called tubal ligation. Tubal ligation is a surgery done to tie off a woman’s fallopian tubes, preventing an egg from meeting sperm cells.  Still, no surgery is 100 percent foolproof. In a very small number of cases, vasectomies can fail.  Before you have a vasectomy, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons. Together you can determine whether this is the best birth control method for you.  How Does a Vasectomy Prevent Pregnancy?  Your sperm are produced and housed in your testicles. The testicles reside inside a pouch called the scrotum. The sperm travel down a tube called the vas deferens. The sperm mix with fluid from the prostate gland to form semen. During ejaculation, semen travel through the urethra and out of the penis into the woman’s body. During a vasectomy, your doctor cuts the vas deferens so sperm can’t get into the semen.  How Is a Vasectomy Performed?  A vasectomy can be done at a urologist’s office, an outpatient surgery center, or a hospital. You’ll usually be awake during the procedure. If you prefer, you may able to receive general anesthesia and sleep through the process. Either way, you’ll receive numbing medicine in your scrotum so that you won’t feel any pain.  In a conventional vasectomy, the doctor makes one or two small cuts in the scrotum to reach the vas deferens. Then, the doctor cuts the vas deferens and ties off the ends. The cuts in the scrotum may be closed with stitches.  Today, vasectomies are often done without a knife. No-scalpel vasectomies reduce the risks for side effects like bleeding and pain. During the procedure, the doctor feels for the vas deferens through the skin of the scrotum and holds it in place. Then, the doctor makes a tiny hole on the side of the scrotum and pulls the vas deferens out through it. The tube is cut or tied, and then put back into the scrotum. No stitches are needed. The hole seals itself.  Vasectomies are very effective. Only about 2 out of every 1,000 women get pregnant in the first year after their partner had the procedure done.  What Happens Next?  About two months after the procedure is done, you’ll meet with your doctor to determine whether sperm is still present in your semen. This is called a semen analysis. You may need to keep having checkups until you’ve reached the three months mark or 20 ejaculations, whichever comes first. During this time, use a backup birth control method such as a condom or diaphragm to prevent pregnancy.  Vasectomies are very effective at preventing pregnancy, but they don’t work right away. Some sperm can remain in the vas deferens in the weeks and months after the surgery. You’ll need to wait for them to clear out before having unprotected sex.  Why a Vasectomy Might Fail  A vasectomy can fail if the doctor misses the vas deferens during the procedure. In rare cases, the tube can regrow. If this does occur, the vas deferens is usually much smaller than it was before.  Sometimes, sperm can make their way from one cut end of the vas deferens to the other. This is most common in the first three months after the procedure. That’s why your doctor will tell you to avoid having unprotected sex until you get confirmation that your semen is free of sperm.  If your doctor finds sperm in repeat tests of your semen, you may need to have a second procedure. Less than 1 percent of vasectomies need to be repeated.  Other Potential Risks  Just like any surgery, a vasectomy carries some degree of risk. Some common risks associated with this procedure are:  bleeding, which is less likely if you have a no-scalpel vasectomy swelling of the scrotum bruising pain an infection a lump that forms when sperm leaks from the cut vas deferens, which is called a sperm granuloma pressure in the testes  A small number of men get a condition called post-vasectomy pain syndrome. Their pain doesn’t decrease after the procedure. It’s not clear what causes this pain. Sometimes, even reversing the procedure doesn’t make the discomfort go away.  Can Impotence (Erectile Dysfunction) Occur After Vasectomy?  A vasectomy won’t affect your ability to have and enjoy sex. You’ll still ejaculate. The only difference is your semen will no longer contain sperm.  Who Should Get a Vasectomy?  A vasectomy is a good choice for men who know for sure that they don’t want to have more children. Although a vasectomy can sometimes be reversed if you change your mind, you’ll need to have another procedure. A vasectomy reversal is a more complicated procedure and isn’t always successful.  Men with an infection in the area around their scrotum should wait to have a vasectomy. Vasectomy also isn’t a good option for men with a bleeding disorder, undescended testicles, or a tumor in the testicles.  If you’re very sensitive or nervous about having surgery in the delicate area of your scrotum, talk with your doctor. Together you can discuss your options and whether this procedure is right for you.  Before having any surgery, you want to weigh the benefits of having the procedure against any risks. Have an open conversation with your doctor, and ask a lot of questions.

Just the thought of allowing a sharp object near your genitals can make the strongest men quiver.  But if you decide to go through with it (i.e. your wife makes you go through with it), then you’ve joined thousands of other brave men ( ladies, try not to laugh) who’ve undergone the procedure. About half a million do it each year.  You’ve probably heard that a vasectomy is one of the most effective forms of birth control. Despite its effectiveness, it’s not foolproof. That’s right, you can get snipped and still get your partner pregnant.  But relax, vasectomy failures are rare…very rare. Less than 1% of vasectomies fail , which compares favorably to tubal ligation which has a 1.85% failure rate. But the risk is still there.  So what causes vasectomy failure? And how can guys get their partner pregnant even years after the procedure? Here are the main culprits.  You Don’t Get the All Clear  Most vasectomy failures happen in the first few months after the procedure, and you don’t know it failed until your wife is staring at the home pregnancy test in disbelief. This is most likely due to human error. And you’re the human we’re talking about.  Sperm can live in your vas deferens for months after your doctor severs them, which means you have a chance to impregnate your partner. That’s why doctors tell couples to use another form of birth control for at least three months after the procedure to flush any lingering sperm out.  After that, you need to confirm your sterility by checking your sperm count. Not keen on going back to the doctor to supply a sample? You can test your status at home with SpermCheck , an over-the-counter male fertility test. It’ll let you know if you’re sterile and can ditch the birth control.  Your Doctor Missed the Vas Deferens  There are rare cases when the doctor misses the vas deferens during a vasectomy. This can occur because challenges with the patient’s anatomy (obesity, scar tissue or extremely thin vas deferens) or if the surgeon cuts two portions from one vas or ties up something other than the vas.  If you follow the proper post-vasectomy sperm check, then you and your doctor will probably catch this mistake before you get a surprise pregnancy.  Your Vas Deferens Reconnect  Even with a successful surgery and you following the proper post-vasectomy plan, your vas deferens can reconnect months or years later. In some cases, this has happened 10 years after a vasectomy!  So how does it happen? Well, even after your vas deferens are severed, your epididymis still carries sperm. The pressure from spermatic fluid can create small drainage channels in the tissue on ends of the severed vas deferens.  Over time, these channels can connect to the divided vas deferens and sperm will have a pathway to the seminal vesicles. Again, this is rare and happens in only . 025% of cases .  No medical procedure is 100% foolproof, including a vasectomy. Failure is rare, but there are instances where it could happen. Some issues are out of your control, but you can make sure you’re not careless those first few months after the procedure by using birth control and checking your sperm count.

Once I got so bold as to Google “failed vasectomy,” my worst fears were confirmed. It happens. Not often, but it happens enough to scare the hell out of me—a woman perfectly content with stopping at two kids.  Vasectomy success rates are estimated at more than 99%, which sounds great at face value. The reason my husband and I went for the big V instead of a tubal is mostly because of price. His vasectomy was only $1000, and it was an outpatient procedure that didn’t seem too uncomfortable for him from my outside perspective. In comparison, the Internets told me that a tubal ligation could cost up to $6000. We also figured that it was his turn to get his man parts smacked around for once. What a guy!     Anyhoo, in my world, vasectomy failure is the stuff nightmares are made of. While it’s highly unlikely to happen, there’s a slim chance I could end up with an unplanned baby after smugly assuming the baby factory is closed forever. Anytime you bring up the topic of vasectomy, there’s always someone who knows someone who knows someone that had baby #3 or #4 after their husband got snipped.  After checking out a few Internet forums, here are some of the scariest vasectomy failure stories I could find with real world consequences:  1. Failed vasectomy made husband’s penis shrivel up and die.     I don’t have any sage advice for this guy per se, but I do feel his metaphorical pain. Even though I’d ultimately love any “surprise” baby that came my way, I probably wouldn’t be too psyched about P-in-the-V until someone could present me with an ironclad contract that promised I would never be pregnant again.     2. Failed vasectomy = baby #4 = depression.   I really feel for this honest mother who is clearly distraught about having a much fuller house than she ever planned for. Even worse, it sounds like she and her husband did everything right and came back with a clear sperm sample but still fell into the minority “failure camp” of 0.6%. That just sucks.     3. Failed vasectomy led to I Didn’t Know I Was Pregnant nightmare scenario.     Whoa, just whoa. The back story on this couple was that they both didn’t want children by choice. What’s even more shocking is that this thin woman hardly gained any weight and didn’t even find out she was pregnant until 27 weeks! This couple ultimately stuck with adoption and ended up dealing with depression and undergoing therapy.   4. Failed vasectomies still happen to cheating douchebags.   If a run-of-the-mill vasectomy failure occurred, the wife could possibly be blamed for cheating since the husband was “fixed.” In this unfortunate story, the husband was smugly banging his secretary and ended up getting her pregnant after a surprise vasectomy bust. Doh!   5. Even the best vasectomy couldn’t stop this super sperm.   I don’t know what kind of bullets this guy is shooting, but they are powerful. After a vasectomy and three follow-up tests, his sperm just can’t take a hint. He may have to undergo a repeat procedure to boot. I don’t know if he should be proud or pissed.

		            May 13, 2016      Facebook 0  Twitter 0  livefyre  Email  Print         When a man gets a vasectomy, you assume he’s no longer able to have kids. But New York Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie and his wife Terricka discovered that’s just not the case. Terricka gave birth to twins on Sunday, after a pregnancy that came as a complete shock to the couple, given that Antonio had had a vasectomy.  Terricka tells Us Weekly that she discovered she was pregnant when she went to the ER with bad stomach cramps in October. “I really thought I was dreaming, even after, I was just in total disbelief,” she says. “It took me a while to process it.”  It sounds surprising, but experts say it happens more often than you’d think.  Dr. Kevin Campbell, a board-certified urologist at The Urology Group, tells SELF that he always gives patients a heads up that vasectomies aren’t foolproof.  “We counsel people that the failure rate for a vasectomy is one in 2,000,” he said.  Related: 18 Things You Should Never Put In Your Vagina  While you’re probably aware that men typically get a vasectomy to avoid having more children, you may not know how it all works. In a vasectomy, a doctor will cut and seal part of the vas deferens, a duct that transports semen from the testicles to the prostate, which eventually lets sperm go out through the penis, Campbell explained. Then, what should happen is that sperm isn’t in a man’s ejaculate.  Dr. Marc Leavey, an internist at Baltimore’s Mercy Medical Center, tells SELF that vasectomies have the greatest risk of failing soon after a man has the procedure done.

If he is, he should wait longer to have unprotected sex. And, while rare, a repeat vasectomy may be necessary in some cases, Norouzi said.  Despite the chance that a man could still have a child after a vasectomy, Campbell points out that the procedure is better than any other form of permanent sterility in terms of success rates.  “One in 2,000 is the best odds you can have other than abstinence or a hysterectomy,” he said.  By the way, Terricka said this is definitely her last pregnancy—she plans to have her tubes tied.

A trained psychotherapist, and an expert on fertility, she holds a Master of Science degree in psychology and a Bachelor of Arts degree in women's studies from Emory University.          Vasectomy is highly effective in preventing pregnancy, but some vasectomies do fail.          Once they are certain that they do not want to have children, many people start looking for effective, long-term birth control solutions. Male sterilization, called vasectomy, is a permanent form of birth control. During a vasectomy, a man's vas deferens is cut, tied, cauterized, or blocked off to prevent sperm from entering his ejaculate during sex. The vasectomy procedure is quick and recovery is also swift, with most men returning to their normal routines within a week. However, vasectomy is not always perfect, and sometimes men are still able to impregnate their partners after the procedure.   Video of the Day             Sperm Survival and Leakage  Within about three months after the vasectomy, men must return to their doctors to have their sperm count checked, and to verify that their ejaculate is free of sperm. At this office visit, some men may still have sperm in their ejaculates. Sperm are able to live in the tiny tubes of a man's reproductive system for several months after vasectomy. Doctors recommend that couples avoid unprotected sex during this time, or pregnancy may result. After the first few months, a primary reason for vasectomy failure is when sperm leak out of the cut end of the vas deferens, create a new channel, and enter a man's reproductive system and ejaculate. This is very rare, but it can lead to pregnancy. A study published in 2004 in the journal "BioMed Central Urology" found that vasectomies using cauterization to close the vas deferens have higher rates of long-term success. Cauterization uses very high temperatures to seal the ends of the vas deferens closed, which may reduce the chances of sperm leaking out of the vas.            Chances of Failure Between Six and 72 Weeks  Researchers from the CDC questioned over 500 fertile women about their experiences with pregnancy after their partner had a vasectomy. The women were contacted periodically over five years. Out of 540 women, six pregnancies occurred within five years, all between six and 72 weeks after vasectomy. Three conceptions took place within 10 weeks of the vasectomy, indicating that sperm were still viable in the man's system. The other three pregnancies occurred at 20, 66, and 72 weeks post-vasectomy. The researchers concluded that the failure rate for every 1,000 vasectomies was 9.4 percent during the first year, and 11.3 percent for years two to five years.  Chances of Failure After 72 Weeks  In the CDC study, no pregnancies were reported between 72 weeks and five years post-vasectomy. The CDC authors acknowledge that vasectomies do fail after five years, although they did not observe it in their study population. Overall, vasectomies are most likely to fail in the first year after the procedure, usually within the first few months.                       Lose Weight. Feel Great!

            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

Vasectomy is a simple, safe procedure is designed to make a man permanently sterile, or unable to father a child. A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy—approximately 5 percent of all married men of reproductive age.  The percutaneous no-scalpel vasectomy is an improvement on a traditional vasectomy. An advanced technique to anesthetize (numb) the scrotum is used, and patients have less discomfort, fewer complications, and a quicker recovery. What's more, no skin stitches or sutures are needed.  Is a vasectomy 100 percent effective?  Other than total abstinence, no method of birth control is 100 percent effective. In rare cases after a vasectomy, it is possible for sperm to find its way across the void between the two blocked ends of the vas deferens. This generally occurs within the first few months after a vasectomy. However, the failure rate of vasectomy is very low. It has been used for many years as a means of sterilization and has a long track record as a safe and effective method of contraception.  If dead or live sperm continue to appear in the semen samples, or if sperm are discovered after a period of sterility, a repeat vasectomy will be necessary. Fortunately, this only happens approximately once in every 1,000 cases, a failure rate far less than for any other form of birth control.

            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

              THE MALE HEALTH CENTER, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS                                                  Vasectomy  Overview | How
            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

              THE MALE HEALTH CENTER, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS                                                  Vasectomy  Overview | How
            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

              THE MALE HEALTH CENTER, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS                                                  Vasectomy  Overview | How
            it works | The procedure | Complications | Risks | Effectiveness | Alternatives  What are your birth
            control options? You and your partner are absolutely sure that you do not want to have
          any more children. Sterilization is an available option, offering an
          almost completely safe and reliable form of permanent birth control.
          Because it is safer and less complicated, most physicians recommend
          male rather than female sterilization to couples.  The vasectomy is a simple office procedure
          in which a segment of the tubes carrying the sperm from the testicles
          is removed, and the ends are sealed off. The procedure takes about
          ten minutes and is performed under a local anesthetic. Check to see
          if you can have a scalpeless vasectomy, which uses a technique in which
          an incision is not made. Most men readily admit that the procedure
          is less painful than a visit to the dentist's office. Additionally,
          the only medication necessary afterward for the discomfort is a mild
          anti-inflammatory such as Advil or Tylenol. In order to minimize the
          discomfort and complications, it is important to stay off your feet
          for one to two days after the procedure. Most instances of complications
          from vasectomies occur because of too much activity following the procedure.  Family Planning:
            When Your Reproductive Years Are Behind You Family size is the most difficult decision most couples ever have to
          make. There are so many aspects to consider: the joy children bring
          to the household, the cost of supporting them, your or your spouse's
          career plans, the medical risks of pregnancy and temporary birth control
          methods, and, of course, what your faith tells you.  Temporary birth control methods—condoms, the diaphragm, the pill,
          etc.—let couples time their births and postpone taking more permanent
          measures. But, used long enough, every one of them might just fail.
          For that reason, many couples eventually choose a more-permanent approach—voluntary
          sterilization.  Only you, yours and your maker can decide about sterilization. But
          I can tell you most couples take time—between two and five years—to
          become sure enough to go ahead.  That's good. Though both common forms of sterilization can be surgically
          reversed, reversal is more complicated and expensive than sterilization,
          insurance companies usually won't pay for it and there's no guarantee
          of success. That's why I like to call sterilization "permanent."  Once you're confident that you're ready to put your reproductive years
          behind you, there are two options: vasectomy (male sterilization) or
          tubal ligation (female sterilization). Vasectomy makes you sterile
          by cutting the pipelines (the vas deferens) between the testicles and
          the penis. These small tubes are located just under the surface of
          the scrotal skin, and it takes less than 15 minutes in the doctor's
          office to snip them and seal the ends under a local anesthetic.  Tubal ligation involves cutting and tying a woman's fallopian tubes,
          which are well below muscles and other tissue in the abdomen. It requires
          a general anesthetic and a hospital visit.  A couple of statistics might make the differences even more clear:   Fatalities per 100,000: tubal
              ligation = 3.51; vasectomy = 0  Approximate cost: tubal ligation
              = $2,500; vasectomy = $750 - 850   Vasectomy is simpler, safer, cheaper
          and takes less time to recover from than tubal ligation. Their failure
          rates are just about the same: 1 in 2,000.  Still, most men naturally squirm at the thought of anyone tampering
          with that part of their bodies. If you hear horror stories about vasectomy,
          press for details. I assure you the tale will turn out to be at least
          third-hand and groundless. I've done more than 4,500 vasectomies and
          have never seen a serious complication. The most frequent comment is, "You
          mean it's over already?"  When a man has a vasectomy Friday afternoon and follows instructions—uses
          ice packs, elevates his feet and is inactive for the weekend (no matter
          how good he feels)—he's back to work on Monday barely feeling
          a thing.  It's worth discussing with your doctor what approach he uses and how
          many vasectomies he's done. Technique and experience can make a significant
          difference both in how quickly you're back on your feet and also in
          the likelihood of failure.  Is sex different after vasectomy? Not at all. Because the testicles
          supply less than 5 percent of the ejaculate, there's no noticeable
          difference in the semen. Erections and sex drive are unaffected—though
          freedom from worry of pregnancy often enhances a couple's sex life.  What about long-term health effects? No repeated studies have ever
          documented a hazard to men who have had vasectomies. And recently,
          researchers at Harvard University reported in the New England Journal
          of Medicine results from the largest study ever of vasectomized men.
          They were unable to associate vasectomy with any health problem in
          14,607 vasectomized men.  Don't choose vasectomy lightly. But if you and your spouse decide you're
          ready for permanent birth control, get the facts and consider it carefully.
          (Write the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, 79 Madison
          Avenue, New York, NY 10016, 212-561-8090, for more information. Please
          include a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope.)  When you understand the choices, I think you'll agree guys, it's the
          least we can do for our women. [ top ]  Overview The vast majority of men who have a vasectomy are delighted by the
            results. But roughly two of every 100 end up regretting the decision.
            Almost without exception, it wasn't the vasectomy's fault. Those
            two simply weren't ready to accept permanent birth control. Usually,
            they're men who have entered a new relationship and have changed
            their mind about fatherhood. (Although vasectomy can sometimes be
            reversed, it should be considered permanent.)  Some of the positive signs that you
          may be ready to have vasectomy include:    You're in a stable, long-term
                marriage of 10 or more years, and both of you agree that you
                do not want more children.  You don't want to or can't use
                temporary methods of birth control.  You or your partner has an inheritable
                disorder that you don't want to risk passing along to a child.  Pregnancy poses a serious health
                risk to your partner.    On the other hand, some of the warning
          signs that vasectomy may not be a good choice include:    You are young.  You have few or no children.  Your relationship with your spouse
                is shaky.  Either you or your partner is
                less than certain about the choice.  You're worried about how it will
                affect your sexuality.  You think there's a chance you
                might want more children if your situation changes (for example,
                a new spouse, death of a child, or improvement in finances).  You think vasectomy reversal
                is a good option if your situation changes.  You're considering "banking" sperm
                just in case.  Your situation requires protection
                against sexually transmitted diseases. (Vasectomy offers no protection
                against STDs.)  You don't understand how vasectomy
                works, how it's done, what the side effects can be and what the
                alternatives are.   How vasectomy
              works Sperm are produced in a man's testes, and they mature in an area
            attached to the testes called the epididymis. It takes about 90 days
            from the time that the sperm are made for them to travel gradually
            up two tubes called the vas deferentia and become available for ejaculation.
            Prior to ejaculation, they're mixed with fluids from the seminal
            vesicles and the prostate to form semen. Vasectomy interrupts this
            process by closing off the vas deferentia, preventing the sperm from
            joining the other fluids. There is no noticeable change in the man's
            semen, because the sperm's contribution to volume is less than 5
            percent.  Vasectomy has no physical effect on a man's virility,
            because it doesn't change the testes' production of the male hormone,
            testosterone. His sex drive, potency, male characteristics, and sexual
            pleasure should be unchanged. (About 30 percent of men report improved
            sexuality after a vasectomy, most likely because the worry of pregnancy
            is eliminated.) After a vasectomy, sperm continue to be produced
            but at a decreased rate. Those that are produced die and are absorbed
            by the body—just as they would be in an unvasectomized man
            who did not ejaculate. [ top ]  How a vasectomy
              is done Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure done in the doctor's office
            that removes a small section of each vas deferens and seals off the
            ends. Prior to the late 1980s, most vasectomies were done using a
            small scalpel, took about 30 minutes, and required a couple of days
            for full recovery. Around 1988, though, a Chinese technique was introduced
            to the United States. The no-scalpel vasectomy simplifies the procedure,
            reducing the total time to between 8 and 10 minutes. No incision
            is made, so no stitches are required. There is less discomfort during
            and after the procedure, complications such as bleeding are reduced,
            and recovery is quicker.  No scalpel vasectomy is done with a special tool that
            creates minimum disturbance. The prick of the needle for the local
            anesthetic is about the extent of what most men feel. Nearly 8,000
            vasectomies have been performed by Dr. Goldberg and the
            most common comment we hear is, "It's over? That's it?" Most
            men don't even need Tylenol afterward, let alone a prescription pain
            killer. Likewise, the pain isn't too great when the bill comes. Vasectomy
            typically costs $800.  If possible, you should have someone come along to
            drive you home, but we've had men drive a couple of hours both ways
            to have a vasectomy here. Spending a couple of days afterward resting
            and applying an ice pack to your scrotum will greatly speed your
            recovery and reduce the risk of complications. [ top ]  Complications
              from vasectomy Only about 10 percent of men experience any sort of complication
            from a vasectomy, and these are usually minor. There has never been
            a death with a vasectomy. Of course, as is the case with any surgical
            procedure, there's always a small risk for bleeding, infection, or
            allergic reaction to the anesthetic, causing a rash. Complications
            specific to vasectomy include the possibility of a sperm granuloma,
            testicular pain, and epididymitis. Also, in very rare instances,
            a man can lose a testicle.  A sperm granuloma occurs if sperm leak
            from the vasectomy site or a rupture in the epididymis and provoke
            an inflammatory reaction. About a half-inch in diameter, they require
            further attention in only about two percent of men. About one percent
            of men experience aching testicles from congestion in the epididymis.
            This usually disappears within six months. Epididymitis is an inflammation
            at the vasectomy site, usually taking place within the first year.
            Heat and anti-inflammatory medicine usually clear it up in about
            a week.  By far the most common complication
            we see is swelling of the scrotum in guys who refuse to take it easy
            for a couple of days after a vasectomy. Unfortunately, once the swelling
            starts, it may take two weeks for it to reduce completely, so prevention
            is the best approach. [ top ]  What
              are the risks of vasectomy? A study has shown that men who have had a vasectomy have an increased
            incidence of prostate
            cancer after 20 years. Since that report, other studies
            have noted that there is no increased incidence of prostate cancer.
            The Male Health Center is monitoring current developments regarding
            this possibility and will be happy to discuss the risk factors in
            more detail at the time of your consultation.  For at least the first six weeks after the procedure, you will be
            advised to use another form of birth control. Afterward, the man's
            semen is checked to ensure no sperm are present. Total charge for
            a vasectomy is typically less than $900. [ top ]  Long-term risks
              of vasectomy Vasectomy is one of the most studied of all medical procedures, yet
            rumors of long-term risks have persisted almost since the beginning
            of its use in the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, the body of medical
            evidence indicates that it is quite safe. Both the National Institutes
            of Health and the World Health Organization have given it a clean
            bill.  Although risks such as heart disease
            and arthritis were pretty much debunked by the 1980s, vasectomy's
            effect on the risk of prostate cancer continues to be studied. Although
            some studies have suggested a relation between the two, others have
            not. A panel of experts was convened by the National Institutes of
            Health to study the available research, and it concluded that the
            evidence for a link between vasectomy and prostate cancer was inconsistent
            and insufficient. No changes were recommended, including no increased
            screening for prostate cancer among men who have had vasectomies. [ top ]         How effective
              is it? The overall failure rate for vasectomy rate is 0.15 percent, but
            that doesn't give an accurate picture of its real effectiveness.
            Most vasectomy failures happen during the first couple of months
            after the procedure, when live sperm may still present in a man's
            semen. Couples must continue to use another method of birth control
            until the man has ejaculated about 20 times (clearing the sperm)
            over as long as six months and tests (we require two) have shown
            that no live sperm remain. Some men skip the tests and end up regretting
            it. About one of every 4,000 vasectomies fails because the vas deferentia
            manage to reconnect—a failure rate of 0.025 percent. [ top ]  What are the
              alternatives? Up to 40 percent of couples considering permanent birth control have
            experienced a failure with a temporary method—such as condoms,
            a diaphragm, spermicides, IUDs, hormonal implants, and the pill—so
            the obvious alternative to vasectomy is tubal ligation for the woman.
            By comparison, tubal ligation is a more involved surgical procedure,
            costing about $1,500 to $2,500, with a greater rate of complication.
            To put it in perspective, the fatality rate for tubal is 3.51 per
            100,000—compared with zero for vasectomy.  Despite the obvious advantages of vasectomy, more tubal
            ligations (about 600,000) than vasectomies (about 500,000) are performed
            each year. Why? Most likely because women have traditionally taken
            the responsibility for birth control. Vasectomy offers men the opportunity
            to begin to set the record straight. [ top ]  What about female sterilization? Tubal ligation is a procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes
              are severed or sealed off, which prevents the egg from being fertilized
              by sperm. Unlike vasectomy, which is a simple outpatient procedure,
              tubal ligation typically is more complex and can require a hospital
              stay. Sometimes tubal ligation can be performed at an ambulatory
              surgery center.  In the most common tubal ligation procedure, the woman's
            fallopian tubes are sealed off with tiny metal rings or clips. It
            is necessary that two incisions be made just below the navel. The
            costs for tubal ligation, including surgeon's fees, operating room
            facility, and anesthesiologist's charges, range anywhere from $1,500
            to $2,500. The procedure requires a general or regional anesthetic.
            A recent study showed that there was an 18 percent incidence of reconnection
            after tubal ligation. [ top ]  What if you change
              your mind? We can plan, but we can't predict the future. So a few man who have
            had a vasectomy—about one in 100 — will attempt to reverse
            it. Fortunately, microsurgical techniques developed in recent years
            have greatly improved the likelihood of success. Two types of surgical
            procedures are used to reverse vasectomy. In men who still have sperm
            present in their vas deferentia, vasovasostomy reconnects the vas.
            When no sperm are found (about one-third of all cases), the far ends
            of the vas deferentia can be directly connected to the epididymis,
            using a technique called vasoepididymostomy.  Neither method of reconnection is easy,
            certain of success, or cheap. Although both can often be done at
            an ambulatory surgery center, with the man going home the same day,
            vasovasostomy takes two to three hours, and vasoepididymostomy can
            take five. The cost will be somewhere between $5,000 and $15,000.
            Overall, the rates of pregnancy are about 50 percent and 20 percent
            respectively, but the chances also depend on how recently the man
            had the vasectomy. For vasovasostomy, the chances of pregnancy are
            as high as three-quarters for the first three years, declining to
            about half for years three through eight, and as low as one-third
            after the fifteenth year. Vasectomy reversal actually turns up sperm
            in semen considerably more often than the pregnancy numbers suggest.
            But sperm don't guarantee pregnancy, and pregnancy is the goal.  If reconnection fails, there is yet
            another option for couples who want children. In a new procedure,
            sperm are aspirated directly from a man's testicle and injected into
            an egg removed from the woman. Once fertilization takes place, the
            egg can be implanted in the woman, where normal gestation can take
            place. Needless to say, this is more complicated and expensive than
            reconnection, and the odds of success are lower.  As you can see, a man who wants to
            reverse his vasectomy has pretty good odds of success. But it's still
            not something to count on when considering a vasectomy as a birth
            control option. [ top ]      About

              THE MALE HEALTH CENTER, LEWISVILLE, TEXAS               Newsletter Vasectomy: Risks, Failure Rates, and Other Must-Knows Medically reviewed by Nicole Galan, RN on  February 11, 2016 — Written by Stephanie Watson Perhaps you’ve had enough children to make your family complete or you’ve decided parenthood isn’t for you. Either way, now you may want to find a birth control method you won’t have to worry about. One permanent birth control option for men is a vasectomy. During this procedure, your surgeon will cut a tube called the vas deferens to stop sperm from getting into the semen and reaching a woman’s body.  Vasectomy is more reliable at preventing pregnancy than any other birth control method. It’s also easier and cheaper than its female equivalent, which is called tubal ligation. Tubal ligation is a surgery done to tie off a woman’s fallopian tubes, preventing an egg from meeting sperm cells.  Still, no surgery is 100 percent foolproof. In a very small number of cases, vasectomies can fail.  Before you have a vasectomy, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons. Together you can determine whether this is the best birth control method for you.  How Does a Vasectomy Prevent Pregnancy?  Your sperm are produced and housed in your testicles. The testicles reside inside a pouch called the scrotum. The sperm travel down a tube called the vas deferens. The sperm mix with fluid from the prostate gland to form semen. During ejaculation, semen travel through the urethra and out of the penis into the woman’s body. During a vasectomy, your doctor cuts the vas deferens so sperm can’t get into the semen.  How Is a Vasectomy Performed?  A vasectomy can be done at a urologist’s office, an outpatient surgery center, or a hospital. You’ll usually be awake during the procedure. If you prefer, you may able to receive general anesthesia and sleep through the process. Either way, you’ll receive numbing medicine in your scrotum so that you won’t feel any pain.  In a conventional vasectomy, the doctor makes one or two small cuts in the scrotum to reach the vas deferens. Then, the doctor cuts the vas deferens and ties off the ends. The cuts in the scrotum may be closed with stitches.  Today, vasectomies are often done without a knife. No-scalpel vasectomies reduce the risks for side effects like bleeding and pain. During the procedure, the doctor feels for the vas deferens through the skin of the scrotum and holds it in place. Then, the doctor makes a tiny hole on the side of the scrotum and pulls the vas deferens out through it. The tube is cut or tied, and then put back into the scrotum. No stitches are needed. The hole seals itself.  Vasectomies are very effective. Only about 2 out of every 1,000 women get pregnant in the first year after their partner had the procedure done.  What Happens Next?  About two months after the procedure is done, you’ll meet with your doctor to determine whether sperm is still present in your semen. This is called a semen analysis. You may need to keep having checkups until you’ve reached the three months mark or 20 ejaculations, whichever comes first. During this time, use a backup birth control method such as a condom or diaphragm to prevent pregnancy.  Vasectomies are very effective at preventing pregnancy, but they don’t work right away. Some sperm can remain in the vas deferens in the weeks and months after the surgery. You’ll need to wait for them to clear out before having unprotected sex.  Why a Vasectomy Might Fail  A vasectomy can fail if the doctor misses the vas deferens during the procedure. In rare cases, the tube can regrow. If this does occur, the vas deferens is usually much smaller than it was before.  Sometimes, sperm can make their way from one cut end of the vas deferens to the other. This is most common in the first three months after the procedure. That’s why your doctor will tell you to avoid having unprotected sex until you get confirmation that your semen is free of sperm.  If your doctor finds sperm in repeat tests of your semen, you may need to have a second procedure. Less than 1 percent of vasectomies need to be repeated.  Other Potential Risks  Just like any surgery, a vasectomy carries some degree of risk. Some common risks associated with this procedure are:  bleeding, which is less likely if you have a no-scalpel vasectomy swelling of the scrotum bruising pain an infection a lump that forms when sperm leaks from the cut vas deferens, which is called a sperm granuloma pressure in the testes  A small number of men get a condition called post-vasectomy pain syndrome. Their pain doesn’t decrease after the procedure. It’s not clear what causes this pain. Sometimes, even reversing the procedure doesn’t make the discomfort go away.  Can Impotence (Erectile Dysfunction) Occur After Vasectomy?  A vasectomy won’t affect your ability to have and enjoy sex. You’ll still ejaculate. The only difference is your semen will no longer contain sperm.  Who Should Get a Vasectomy?  A vasectomy is a good choice for men who know for sure that they don’t want to have more children. Although a vasectomy can sometimes be reversed if you change your mind, you’ll need to have another procedure. A vasectomy reversal is a more complicated procedure and isn’t always successful.  Men with an infection in the area around their scrotum should wait to have a vasectomy. Vasectomy also isn’t a good option for men with a bleeding disorder, undescended testicles, or a tumor in the testicles.  If you’re very sensitive or nervous about having surgery in the delicate area of your scrotum, talk with your doctor. Together you can discuss your options and whether this procedure is right for you.  Before having any surgery, you want to weigh the benefits of having the procedure against any risks. Have an open conversation with your doctor, and ask a lot of questions.

Just the thought of allowing a sharp object near your genitals can make the strongest men quiver.  But if you decide to go through with it (i.e. your wife makes you go through with it), then you’ve joined thousands of other brave men ( ladies, try not to laugh) who’ve undergone the procedure. About half a million do it each year.  You’ve probably heard that a vasectomy is one of the most effective forms of birth control. Despite its effectiveness, it’s not foolproof. That’s right, you can get snipped and still get your partner pregnant.  But relax, vasectomy failures are rare…very rare. Less than 1% of vasectomies fail , which compares favorably to tubal ligation which has a 1.85% failure rate. But the risk is still there.  So what causes vasectomy failure? And how can guys get their partner pregnant even years after the procedure? Here are the main culprits.  You Don’t Get the All Clear  Most vasectomy failures happen in the first few months after the procedure, and you don’t know it failed until your wife is staring at the home pregnancy test in disbelief. This is most likely due to human error. And you’re the human we’re talking about.  Sperm can live in your vas deferens for months after your doctor severs them, which means you have a chance to impregnate your partner. That’s why doctors tell couples to use another form of birth control for at least three months after the procedure to flush any lingering sperm out.  After that, you need to confirm your sterility by checking your sperm count. Not keen on going back to the doctor to supply a sample? You can test your status at home with SpermCheck , an over-the-counter male fertility test. It’ll let you know if you’re sterile and can ditch the birth control.  Your Doctor Missed the Vas Deferens  There are rare cases when the doctor misses the vas deferens during a vasectomy. This can occur because challenges with the patient’s anatomy (obesity, scar tissue or extremely thin vas deferens) or if the surgeon cuts two portions from one vas or ties up something other than the vas.  If you follow the proper post-vasectomy sperm check, then you and your doctor will probably catch this mistake before you get a surprise pregnancy.  Your Vas Deferens Reconnect  Even with a successful surgery and you following the proper post-vasectomy plan, your vas deferens can reconnect months or years later. In some cases, this has happened 10 years after a vasectomy!  So how does it happen? Well, even after your vas deferens are severed, your epididymis still carries sperm. The pressure from spermatic fluid can create small drainage channels in the tissue on ends of the severed vas deferens.  Over time, these channels can connect to the divided vas deferens and sperm will have a pathway to the seminal vesicles. Again, this is rare and happens in only . 025% of cases .  No medical procedure is 100% foolproof, including a vasectomy. Failure is rare, but there are instances where it could happen. Some issues are out of your control, but you can make sure you’re not careless those first few months after the procedure by using birth control and checking your sperm count.

Once I got so bold as to Google “failed vasectomy,” my worst fears were confirmed. It happens. Not often, but it happens enough to scare the hell out of me—a woman perfectly content with stopping at two kids.  Vasectomy success rates are estimated at more than 99%, which sounds great at face value. The reason my husband and I went for the big V instead of a tubal is mostly because of price. His vasectomy was only $1000, and it was an outpatient procedure that didn’t seem too uncomfortable for him from my outside perspective. In comparison, the Internets told me that a tubal ligation could cost up to $6000. We also figured that it was his turn to get his man parts smacked around for once. What a guy!     Anyhoo, in my world, vasectomy failure is the stuff nightmares are made of. While it’s highly unlikely to happen, there’s a slim chance I could end up with an unplanned baby after smugly assuming the baby factory is closed forever. Anytime you bring up the topic of vasectomy, there’s always someone who knows someone who knows someone that had baby #3 or #4 after their husband got snipped.  After checking out a few Internet forums, here are some of the scariest vasectomy failure stories I could find with real world consequences:  1. Failed vasectomy made husband’s penis shrivel up and die.     I don’t have any sage advice for this guy per se, but I do feel his metaphorical pain. Even though I’d ultimately love any “surprise” baby that came my way, I probably wouldn’t be too psyched about P-in-the-V until someone could present me with an ironclad contract that promised I would never be pregnant again.     2. Failed vasectomy = baby #4 = depression.   I really feel for this honest mother who is clearly distraught about having a much fuller house than she ever planned for. Even worse, it sounds like she and her husband did everything right and came back with a clear sperm sample but still fell into the minority “failure camp” of 0.6%. That just sucks.     3. Failed vasectomy led to I Didn’t Know I Was Pregnant nightmare scenario.     Whoa, just whoa. The back story on this couple was that they both didn’t want children by choice. What’s even more shocking is that this thin woman hardly gained any weight and didn’t even find out she was pregnant until 27 weeks! This couple ultimately stuck with adoption and ended up dealing with depression and undergoing therapy.   4. Failed vasectomies still happen to cheating douchebags.   If a run-of-the-mill vasectomy failure occurred, the wife could possibly be blamed for cheating since the husband was “fixed.” In this unfortunate story, the husband was smugly banging his secretary and ended up getting her pregnant after a surprise vasectomy bust. Doh!   5. Even the best vasectomy couldn’t stop this super sperm.   I don’t know what kind of bullets this guy is shooting, but they are powerful. After a vasectomy and three follow-up tests, his sperm just can’t take a hint. He may have to undergo a repeat procedure to boot. I don’t know if he should be proud or pissed.

		            May 13, 2016      Facebook 0  Twitter 0  livefyre  Email  Print         When a man gets a vasectomy, you assume he’s no longer able to have kids. But New York Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie and his wife Terricka discovered that’s just not the case. Terricka gave birth to twins on Sunday, after a pregnancy that came as a complete shock to the couple, given that Antonio had had a vasectomy.  Terricka tells Us Weekly that she discovered she was pregnant when she went to the ER with bad stomach cramps in October. “I really thought I was dreaming, even after, I was just in total disbelief,” she says. “It took me a while to process it.”  It sounds surprising, but experts say it happens more often than you’d think.  Dr. Kevin Campbell, a board-certified urologist at The Urology Group, tells SELF that he always gives patients a heads up that vasectomies aren’t foolproof.  “We counsel people that the failure rate for a vasectomy is one in 2,000,” he said.  Related: 18 Things You Should Never Put In Your Vagina  While you’re probably aware that men typically get a vasectomy to avoid having more children, you may not know how it all works. In a vasectomy, a doctor will cut and seal part of the vas deferens, a duct that transports semen from the testicles to the prostate, which eventually lets sperm go out through the penis, Campbell explained. Then, what should happen is that sperm isn’t in a man’s ejaculate.  Dr. Marc Leavey, an internist at Baltimore’s Mercy Medical Center, tells SELF that vasectomies have the greatest risk of failing soon after a man has the procedure done.

If he is, he should wait longer to have unprotected sex. And, while rare, a repeat vasectomy may be necessary in some cases, Norouzi said.  Despite the chance that a man could still have a child after a vasectomy, Campbell points out that the procedure is better than any other form of permanent sterility in terms of success rates.  “One in 2,000 is the best odds you can have other than abstinence or a hysterectomy,” he said.  By the way, Terricka said this is definitely her last pregnancy—she plans to have her tubes tied.

A trained psychotherapist, and an expert on fertility, she holds a Master of Science degree in psychology and a Bachelor of Arts degree in women's studies from Emory University.          Vasectomy is highly effective in preventing pregnancy, but some vasectomies do fail.          Once they are certain that they do not want to have children, many people start looking for effective, long-term birth control solutions. Male sterilization, called vasectomy, is a permanent form of birth control. During a vasectomy, a man's vas deferens is cut, tied, cauterized, or blocked off to prevent sperm from entering his ejaculate during sex. The vasectomy procedure is quick and recovery is also swift, with most men returning to their normal routines within a week. However, vasectomy is not always perfect, and sometimes men are still able to impregnate their partners after the procedure.   Video of the Day             Sperm Survival and Leakage  Within about three months after the vasectomy, men must return to their doctors to have their sperm count checked, and to verify that their ejaculate is free of sperm. At this office visit, some men may still have sperm in their ejaculates. Sperm are able to live in the tiny tubes of a man's reproductive system for several months after vasectomy. Doctors recommend that couples avoid unprotected sex during this time, or pregnancy may result. After the first few months, a primary reason for vasectomy failure is when sperm leak out of the cut end of the vas deferens, create a new channel, and enter a man's reproductive system and ejaculate. This is very rare, but it can lead to pregnancy. A study published in 2004 in the journal "BioMed Central Urology" found that vasectomies using cauterization to close the vas deferens have higher rates of long-term success. Cauterization uses very high temperatures to seal the ends of the vas deferens closed, which may reduce the chances of sperm leaking out of the vas.            Chances of Failure Between Six and 72 Weeks  Researchers from the CDC questioned over 500 fertile women about their experiences with pregnancy after their partner had a vasectomy. The women were contacted periodically over five years. Out of 540 women, six pregnancies occurred within five years, all between six and 72 weeks after vasectomy. Three conceptions took place within 10 weeks of the vasectomy, indicating that sperm were still viable in the man's system. The other three pregnancies occurred at 20, 66, and 72 weeks post-vasectomy. The researchers concluded that the failure rate for every 1,000 vasectomies was 9.4 percent during the first year, and 11.3 percent for years two to five years.  Chances of Failure After 72 Weeks  In the CDC study, no pregnancies were reported between 72 weeks and five years post-vasectomy. The CDC authors acknowledge that vasectomies do fail after five years, although they did not observe it in their study population. Overall, vasectomies are most likely to fail in the first year after the procedure, usually within the first few months.                       Lose Weight. Feel Great!
