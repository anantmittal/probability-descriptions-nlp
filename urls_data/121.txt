What are some causes? How often do people have lung nodules? And what are the chances that it's lung cancer ? It's important to state right away that the majority —at least 60 percent of lung nodules overall—are not cancerous. We will talk about these possible causes, but it's equally important to note that if a nodule is lung cancer there is still a good chance that it can be cured.         A nodule, by definition, is less than three centimeters in diameter, and at this size, many lung cancers are very curable. Yet even for lung cancers that are larger, the treatment and survival rates for lung cancer have improved significantly in just the past few years. A final point before beginning is to note that following through on getting a diagnosis is important even if you've never smoked. At the current time, there are more former smokers and never smokers who develop lung cancer , than people who smoke. What Are Lung Nodules? A lung nodule is defined as a “spot” on the lung that is three centimeters (about 1.5 inches) in diameter or less. These nodules are often referred to as "coin lesions" when described on an imaging test. If an abnormality is seen on an x-ray of the lungs is larger than three centimeters, it is considered a “ lung mass ” instead of a nodule and is more likely to be cancerous.   Lung nodules usually need to be at least one centimeter in size before they can be seen on a chest x-ray, whereas nodules as small as one to two millimeters may sometimes be seen on a CT scan. Prevalence Lung nodules are quite common and are found on one in 500 chest x-rays, and one in 100 CT scans of the chest.         Approximately 150,000 lung nodules are detected in people in the United States each year. Roughly half of people over the age of 50 who smoke will have nodules on a CT scan of their chest. If a potential nodule is seen on a chest x-ray, it is important to have a CT scan. Small cancers can be missed on a chest x-ray . Symptoms Most lung nodules do not cause any symptoms and are found “accidentally” or "incidentally" when a chest x-ray is done for some other reason. If symptoms are present, they may include a cough, coughing up blood, wheezing, shortness of breath, or respiratory infections if the nodule(s) is located near a major airway. Causes Lung nodules can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancer). The most common causes overall include granulomas (clumps of inflamed tissue due to an infection or inflammation) and hamartomas (benign lung tumors). The most common cause of malignant lung nodules includes lung cancer or cancers from other regions of the body that have spread to the lungs ( metastatic cancer ). Nodules can be broken down into a few major categories. Infections - Infectious causes of nodules may include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, and coccidiomycosis, and parasitic infections such as ascariasis (roundworms,) echinococcus (hydatid cysts) and paragonimous (liver flukes.) When the immune system "walls off" areas of infection it often forms granulomas.         Inflammation - Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , sarcoidosis , and Wegener's granulomatosis, as well as pneumoconioses such as silicosis can also lead to granulomas. Benign tumors - Benign lung tumors such as hamartomas (the most common benign lung tumor,) bronchial adenomas, fibromas, blastomas, neurofibromas, and hemangiomas. can show up as a nodule in the lungs on x-ray. Malignant tumors – Cancers that may appear as a nodule includes lung cancer, lymphomas , sarcomas, and carcinoid tumors. Metastases - Lung nodules may also be due to metastases from other cancers such as breast cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer.  Other benign nodules - Pulmonary infarctions (areas of lung tissue that have lost their blood supply,) blood vessel abnormalities (AV malformations,) atelectasis (collapse of part of a lung,) pulmonary fibrosis , and amyloidosis are all other possible causes of a lung nodule. Diagnosis The first thing your doctor will want to do if she sees a lung nodule on your x-ray is to obtain any previous x-rays you have had and compare them. If the nodule or nodules have been present for a long time, further tests may not be needed. If the nodule is new or you don’t have any prior x-rays to compare, further workup may be needed. If a nodule is found on a chest x-ray, the first step will usually be to do a CT scan of your chest. Other tests such as an MRI may be needed. At this point, your doctor will want to know your history as well as any risk factors you have for any type of lung nodules (see below.) For example, if you have recently traveled, a fungal infection may be more likely whereas if you have smoked, a malignant tumor may be more likely. Characteristics of the tumor as seen on your CT scan will also be evaluated. A PET scan is sometimes helpful in further defining a nodule. Unlike CT scans and MRI are "structural" tests. They can find lesions in the lungs but don't really give a measure of what is happening in a nodule. With a PET scan, a small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into your blood stream. Actively growing tumors take up more of the sugar which lights up on the exam. This can be helpful in distinguishing a growing tumor from a scar tissue as a growing tumor will take up more of the sugar. This is especially helpful for those who have had previous chest radiation, lung infections or surgery which may result in scar tissue. If a nodule does not appear to be growing or has characteristics of a benign tumor, (has "low probability" of being cancer) a "wait and watch" approach may sometimes be taken with a CT scan repeated after a certain period of time. Single solitary nodules that have remained unchanged for a period of two or more years do not generally need any further workup. Biopsy of Pulmonary Nodules Unfortunately, a lung biopsy is often needed to know for sure what is causing a nodule. Thankfully, newer and less invasive methods of sampling tissue are now often available. This may be important even if your doctor is fairly sure what is causing the nodule or nodules. An example is when nodules are thought to be metastatic cancer from another tumor such as breast cancer. Recent research suggests that even when a lung nodule is found in a person who might be expected to have lung metastases, only half of the nodules were metastases when biopsied. Up to 25 percent, rather, were a second primary lung cancer. Depending on the location of the nodule, a fine needle biopsy may be done. Sometimes an endobronchial ultrasound and biopsy can be done as part of a  bronchoscopy. At times an open biopsy may be needed. Even when this is the case, newer techniques, such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) can often be done instead of a thoracotomy. Benign vs. Malignant Nodules Overall, the likelihood that a lung nodule is cancer is 40 percent, but the risk of a lung nodule being cancerous varies considerably depending on several factors. In people less than 35 years of age, the chance that a lung nodule is cancer is less than one percent, whereas half of lung nodules in people over age 50 are malignant (cancerous). Other factors that raise or lower the risk that a lung nodule is cancer include: Size - Larger nodules are more likely to be cancerous than smaller ones. Smoking - Current and former smokers are more likely to have cancerous lung nodules than never smokers. Learn the percentage of smokers who get lung cancer. Occupation - Some occupational exposures raise the likelihood that a nodule is cancer. Medical history - Having a history of cancer increases the chance that a nodule could be malignant. Family histor y - Those who have nodules and a family history of lung cancer are more likely to have cancerous nodules than those without a family history. Symptoms - The chance that a nodule is lung cancer is greater if other signs or symptoms of lung cancer are present. Shape/appearance of the nodule - Smooth, round nodules are more likely to be benign, whereas “spiculated” nodules, or with irregular or lobular borders are more likely to be cancerous. Solid/non-solid - Nodules that are part solid rather than solid are more likely to be cancerous Growth - Cancerous lung nodules tend to grow fairly rapidly with an average doubling time of about four months, while benign nodules tend to remain the same size over time. Calcification - Lung nodules that are calcified are more likely to be benign. Cavitation - Nodules described as “cavitary,” meaning that the interior part of the nodule appears darker on x-rays, are more likely to be benign. Ground glass nodules - Nodules that are described as having a ground glass appearance are often a challenge and can be either benign or malignant. Due to this difficulty, a biopsy of these lesions is usually needed. The number of nodules - Those who have multiple nodules are more likely to have cancer than those who have a solitary or only a few pulmonary nodules. Location of the nodules - Lobules located in the right or left lower lobes or the right middle lobe of the lung are less likely to be cancerous than those located in the left or right upper lobes. Ethnicity and geographic location - If you have traveled outside the United States, a lung nodule is more likely to be benign. For example, ecent studies have found that lung nodules due to schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection, are fairly common in African migrants . Likewise, nodules related to fungal infections, such as coccidiomycosis are common in the Southwest. Indeterminate Lung Nodules The number of lung nodules that are read by radiologists as "indeterminate" has increased with the advent of lung cancer screening. Hearing that your nodule or nodules are indeterminate can be confusing. Isn't it obvious? Unfortunately, there are times when it is impossible on imaging tests alone to know whether a nodule is malignant—even after considering all of the factors above. In order to answer this question, a biopsy must be done. Thankfully, radiologists, surgeons, and pathologists together are finding less invasive methods of sampling tissue. To understand better why this question is so difficult, you may wish to learn more about the differences between benign and malignant tumors . Lung Cancer Screening Lung cancer screening in appropriate people has been found to decrease the mortality rate from lung cancer by 20 percent. But as with any screening test, there is the risk of false positives, and it's common to find nodules on CT screening. But finding nodules does not always mean cancer. In fact, studies thus far estimate that  only around five percent of nodules found on a first lung CT screening are cancerous. Treatment The treatment of lung nodules varies widely depending upon the cause, whether they are related to infections, inflammation, cancer, or other conditions. Most benign lung nodules, especially those that are present and haven’t changed over a period of a few years, can be left alone. A Word From Verywell If you've heard that you or a loved one have a lung nodule you are probably a combination of nervous and overwhelmed. There are so many different possibilities and some of these are frightening. It may help a little to consider that the majority of nodules are not cancer, and even those that are may be curable with surgery. If you decide to research your nodule in line it's important to note that the science is changing rapidly. Newer diagnostic techniques are becoming available as well as new treatments each year. Since medicine is changing so rapidly, It's important to be your own advocate in your medical care. If you aren't getting answers, ask more questions. Consider getting a second opinion regardless of what you hear. Finally, reach out to family and friends. If your nodule turns out to be lung cancer there is an active lung cancer community that will welcome you in. Sources: Gould, M., Donington, J., Lynch, W. et al.

Lung nodules — small masses of tissue in the lung — are quite common. They appear as round, white shadows on a chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan.  Lung nodules are usually about 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) to 1.2 inches (30 millimeters) in size. A larger lung nodule, such as one that's 30 millimeters or larger, is more likely to be cancerous than is a smaller lung nodule.  If your doctor detects a lung nodule on an imaging test, it's helpful to compare your current imaging scan with a previous one. If the nodule on earlier images hasn't changed in size, shape or appearance in two years, it's probably noncancerous.  Noncancerous lung nodules are often caused by previous infections. Noncancerous lung nodules usually require no treatment. In some cases your doctor may recommend annual chest imaging to see if a lung nodule grows or changes over time.  If a lung nodule is new or has changed in size, shape or appearance, your doctor may recommend further testing — such as a CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, bronchoscopy or tissue biopsy — to determine if it's cancerous.

The thyroid gland is located in the lower front of the neck, below the voicebox (larynx) and above the collarbones.  A thyroid nodule is a lump in or on the thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are detected in about 6 percent of women and 1-2 percent of men; they occur 10 times as often in older individuals, but are usually not diagnosed.  Any time a lump is discovered in thyroid tissue, the possibility of malignancy ( cancer ) must be considered. More than 95 percent of thyroid nodules are benign (noncancerous), but tests are needed to determine if a nodule is cancerous.  Benign nodules include:   Multinodular goiter, also called a nontoxic goiter. The word goiter means the thyroid gland has grown too large. This usually happens when the pituitary gland in the brain creates too much thyroid stimulating hormone. If the goiter is small, the problem may be treated with thyroid hormone pills. Surgery is needed if the goiter is large or does not stop growing after taking thyroid hormones. A large thyroid gland can press against the trachea (windpipe) or esophagus (food tube) and cause difficult breathing or eating.  Benign follicular adenomas. The word follicular means the cells look like a group of small circles under a microscope. If the follicular cells are contained within the nodule, the condition is called benign. If the cells have invaded the surrounding tissue, the diagnosis is cancer.  Thyroid cysts are nodules filled with fluid. If a nodule has both fluid and solid parts, it is called a complex nodule. They need to be surgically removed if they cause neck pain or difficultly swallowing.     What causes thyroid nodules?  Nodules can be caused by a simple overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue, fluid-filled cysts, inflammation (thyroiditis) or a tumor (either benign or cancerous). Most nodules were surgically removed until the 1980s. In retrospect, this approach led to many unnecessary operations, since fewer than 10 percent of the removed nodules proved to be cancerous. Most removed nodules could have simply been observed or treated medically.  Chronic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) is an inflammation of the thyroid gland that develops slowly. It frequently leads to a decreased function of the thyroid ( hypothyroidism ). Thyroiditis occurs when the body's immune system destroys the cells in the thyroid gland. Chronic thyroiditis is most common in women and people with a family history of thyroid disease.    What are the symptoms of thyroid nodules? Many patients with thyroid nodules have no symptoms and are found by chance to have a lump in the thyroid gland during a routine physical exam or an imaging study done for unrelated reasons. A minority of patients may become aware of a gradually enlarging lump in the front portion of the neck or may experience a vague pressure sensation or discomfort when swallowing. A lump in the neck should be brought to the attention of your physician, even in the absence of symptoms.   How are thyroid nodules diagnosed?  Fine Needle Biopsy  A thyroid fine needle biopsy is a simple procedure that can be performed in the physician's office. Some physicians numb the skin over the nodule prior to the biopsy, but it is not necessary to be put to sleep, and patients can usually return to work or home afterward with no ill effects.  This test provides information that no other test can offer short of surgery. A thyroid needle biopsy will provide sufficient information on which to base a treatment decision more than 85 percent of the time if an ultrasound is used.  Use of fine needle biopsy has drastically reduced the number of patients who have undergone unnecessary operations for benign nodules. However, about 10-20 percent of biopsy specimens are interpreted as inconclusive or inadequate, that is, the pathologist cannot be certain whether the nodule is cancerous or benign.  In such cases, a physician who is experienced with thyroid disease can use other criteria to make a decision about whether to operate.  Thyroid Scan  A thyroid scan is a picture of the thyroid gland taken after a small dose of a radioactive isotope normally concentrated by thyroid cells has been injected or swallowed. The scan tells whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning (a "hot" nodule). Because cancer is rarely found in hot nodules, a scan showing a hot nodule eliminates the need for fine needle biopsy. If a hot nodule causes hyperthyroidism, it can be treated with radioiodine or surgery.  Neither a thyroid scan nor radioiodine treatment should ever be given to a pregnant woman. Small amounts of radioactive iodine will be excreted in breast milk. Since radioiodine could permanently damage the infant's thyroid, breast-feeding is not allowed for women undergoing radioiodine treatment.  Ultrasound  In thyroid ultrasoundography, high-frequency sound waves pass through the skin and are reflected back to the machine to create detailed images of the thyroid. It can visualize nodules as small as 2-3 millimeters. Ultrasound distinguishes thyroid cysts (fluid-filled nodules) from solid nodules. Recent advances in ultrasonography helps physicians identify nodules which are more likely to be cancerous.  Thyroid ultrasonography is also used for guidance of a fine needle for aspirating thyroid nodules. Ultrasound guidance enables physicians to biopsy the nodule to obtain an adequate amount of material for interpretation.  Even when a thyroid biopsy sample is reported as benign, the size of the nodule should be monitored. A thyroid ultrasound examination provides an objective and precise method for detection of a change in the size of the nodule. A nodule with a benign biopsy that is stable or decreasing in size is unlikely to be malignant or require surgical treatment.    How are thyroid nodules treated?  Most patients who appear to have benign nodules require no specific treatment. Some physicians prescribe the hormone levothyroxine with hopes of preventing nodule growth or reducing the size of cold nodules. Radioiodine may be used to treat hot nodules. In a patient with a known thyroid nodule, the initial step is to determine the risk for cancer. High-risk factors include:  Being male under age 40  A history of radiation therapy to the head or neck  Big lymph nodes in the neck  Problems swallowing  Problems speaking  A family history of thyroid cancer   If the lesion is benign, the patient is monitored via ultrasound for the growth of the nodule or development of new nodules. If there is growth, another biopsy may be performed. If the lesion is malignant, the patient is referred to one of the Thyroid Cancer Program surgeons for removal of the thyroid.  About 10 percent of the time, the pathologist is unable to provide a diagnosis due to lack of specimen from the aspiration. That suggests an increased risk for malignancy, which may require surgery or monitoring.  In most surgeries, the entire thyroid is removed (total thyroidectomy). Lymph nodes also may be removed to determine if the tumor has spread beyond the thyroid gland . Subsequent therapy depends upon the findings at the time of surgery. Some patients may be placed on thyroid hormone and followed with blood tests and ultrasound examinations, while other will receive radioactive iodine to destroy the residual thyroid tissue and then be followed with blood tests and ultrasounds.  Using this type of therapy, the majority of cancers will be either cured or controlled and less than 20 percent will recur. In the case of aggressive disease, a patient may qualify for clinical trials with newer therapies such as targeted chemotherapies.    Key points   A thyroid nodule is a lump in or on the thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are detected in about 6 percent of women and 1-2 percent of men; they occur 10 times as often in older individuals, but are usually not diagnosed.  Any time a lump is discovered in thyroid tissue, the possibility of cancer must be considered.  More than 95 percent of thyroid nodules are benign.     Next steps  Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:   Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen.  Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.  Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.  At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you.  Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are.  Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways.  Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.  Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.  If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.  Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.     Not what you're looking for?

What do physicians mean when they say “lung mass,” what are possible causes, what are the chances its lung cancer, and what tests might be recommended to determine the cause? Definition A "lung mass" is defined as an abnormal spot or area in the lungs that is more than 3 cm (1 ½ inches) in size.         If a spot (or spots) is less than 3 cm in diameter, it is instead called a " lung nodule ." The most common causes of a lung mass differ from that of a lung nodule, as well as the chance that the abnormality may be cancer. Causes As noted above, the term lung nodule is used to describe smaller abnormal areas in the lungs than a lung mass. Overall, the chance that a lung nodule is benign is greater than the chance that it is malignant (cancerous), Unfortunately, the most common cause of a mass in the lungs is one of the types of lung cancer . Before you get too upset in reading this, however, there are benign causes of a lung mass. And even if it is lung cancer, both the treatments for and the survival have improved in recent years. As you read on, keep this in mind, especially if you have known someone who had lung cancer more than a year or two ago. In some cases, advanced lung cancer (stage 4 lung cancer) can almost be treated as a chronic disease.   And immunotherapy drugs (the first approved in 2015 and now 4 available) can sometimes lead to a "durable response" (oncology lingo for perhaps even a cure) for people with even the most advanced stages of the disease. Lung cancer is far too common and is currently the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women in the United States.         Lung cancer may occur even in people who have never smoked, and in fact, the majority (around 80 percent) of people who develop lung cancer at this time do not smoke; they are either former smokers or never smoked. At least 20 percent of women who develop lung cancer have never smoked a single cigarette. Unlike the reduction of lung cancer in older men, for one group of people, lung cancer has been increasing significantly: young, never-smoking women. That said, there are benign (non-cancerous) causes of lung masses. Some causes of a lung mass include: Lung cancer. Other cancers. Some cancers that may appear as a mass in the lungs include lymphomas and sarcomas. Benign (non-cancerous) lung tumors, such as hamartomas , the most common type of benign lung tumor. Metastases (spread) of cancers from other regions of the body to the lung. The most common cancers which spread to the lungs and can cause a lung mass or masses include breast cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer. Lung abscesses. Abscesses are infections which have been "walled off" and contained by the body. AV malformations. An AV malformation is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins that are usually present from birth.         Lipoid pneumonia. Infections. Fungal infections such as coccidiomycosis and blastomycosis and parasitic infections such as echinococcus (hydatid cysts) can cause a lung mass. Pulmonary artery aneurysms. An outpouching in the arteries that travel from the heart to the lungs can appear as a mass on imaging tests. Amyloidosis . Amyloidosis is a build up of abnormal proteins that form a mass. Link to Cancer Sadly, the most likely diagnosis, if you have a lung mass, is lung cancer. Yet there are many non-cancerous causes, as noted above. A lung mass is more likely to be cancerous if it is described as “ ground glass ” on an imaging report, whereas the finding of “ calcifications ” is more common in benign tumors.  If a tumor is described as “ cavitary ” it is also more likely to be benign. A history of smoking, or working in occupations with exposures to cancer-causing substances raises the chances that a tumor is cancer. Questions Your Doctor Might Ask The first thing your doctor will want to do is perform a careful history and physical. Some of the questions she might ask include: Have you ever smoked? Have you traveled recently? What other medical conditions do you have? Do you have a family history of any medical problems including lung cancer and other lung conditions? Have you been exposed to elevated radon levels in your home? ( Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer.) Are you having any symptoms such as a persistent cough , coughing up blood , shortness of breath , pain in the area of your lung , shoulder , or back , or have you had unexplained weight loss ? Diagnosis Depending on the results of a careful history and physical exam, further tests might include: A CT scan. If your doctor noted a lung mass on a chest x-ray , one of the first things she may recommend is a CT scan to look at the mass more closely. This can help define the size and location of the mass, and sometimes make sure that the mass wasn’t an “artifact” on the x-ray— that is, something that looked like a mass but wasn’t, such as an overlap of tissues. MRI studies. A PET Scan . A PET scan is an imaging study that looks for active growth in an area that is suspicious. For example, a suspicious area that does not light up on a PET scan may be old scar tissue whereas an area that lights up (shows sign of active growth) is more likely to be a cancerous tumor. Tests like this can be especially helpful if a person has had radiation treatment for breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, or lung cancer in the past, as radiation may cause scar tissue that looks a lot like a tumor on imaging. A Bronchoscopy . If the mass is in the central area of the lungs near the large airways, a bronchoscopy may be recommended. During a bronchoscopy, doctors pass a flexible tube through your mouth and down into your bronchi. This test can look for abnormalities in and near the large airways, and a biopsy can be performed if needed. An endobronchial ultrasound may also be done (an ultrasound that is done through the bronchi) during a bronchoscopy to better view abnormalities deeper in the lungs but relatively close to the airways. A fine needle biopsy . If your lung mass is in the outer regions of the lungs, your doctor may recommend a biopsy with a needle that is placed through the chest wall and into the mass to get a tissue sample. Lung surgery . Sometimes it may be difficult to get a sample of the cells in your lung mass with either a needle biopsy or via a bronchoscopy. If this is the case, thoracic surgery may be recommended to get a sample of tissue . This may be done through small incisions and using instruments with a camera (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery), or through a traditional incision to access the lungs (thoractomy). Treatment The treatment of your lung mass will depend on the underlying cause. If it is a cancerous tumor of the lung or from the spread of cancer from another region of the body to the lung, treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Other less common causes of lung masses, such as infections, will be treated based on the diagnosis you and your doctor determine after testing. Benign vs. Malignant Masses It can be very confusing when you are first diagnosed with a lung nodule or lung mass. Why isn't it easier to tell if something is cancerous or not? Why are the treatments so different? It can be helpful to learn the difference between a malignant and benign tumor . A Word From Verywell If your doctor is pretty sure that your lung mass is cancer, you may be feeling scared. What does this mean? What happens next? If that describes you, take a moment to learn about the first steps to take when you are diagnosed with lung cancer . Remember that treatments are improving. Be your own advocate and learn as much as you can about your disease. There is also a wonderful lung cancer community available online with people who can provide support (the kind that only someone else living with the disease can) while helping you better understand your cancer and your options.

Newsletter What causes a spot on the lung? Medically reviewed by Monica Bien, PA-C on  November 22, 2016 — Written by Valencia Higuera Causes Next steps Outlook Spot on the lungs   A spot on the lungs usually refers to a pulmonary nodule. This is a small, round growth on the lungs that shows up as a white spot on image scans. Typically, these nodules are smaller than three 3 centimeters (cm) in diameter.  If your doctor sees a pulmonary nodule on a chest X-ray or CT scan , don’t panic. Pulmonary nodules are common and most are benign or noncancerous. Nodules are found on up to half of all lung CT scans. When a pulmonary nodule is cancerous, the spot or growth is usually larger than 3 cm or has other characteristics like an irregular shape.  Pulmonary nodules don’t cause symptoms. You may have a nodule on your lungs for years and never know it. If a spot on your lungs is cancerous, you may have symptoms related to the specific type of cancer. For example, growths caused by lung cancer may cause a persistent cough or breathing difficulties.  Causes Causes of pulmonary
nodules  Noncancerous pulmonary nodules can develop from conditions that cause inflammation or scar tissue on the lungs. Possible causes include:  lung infections, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis granuloma, which are small clumps of cells that grow because of inflammation noninfectious diseases that cause noncancerous nodules, such as sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis neoplasms, which are abnormal growths that can be benign or cancerous cancerous tumors, such as lung cancer , lymphoma , sarcoma metastatic tumors that spread from other parts of the body  Less than 5 percent of pulmonary nodules are malignant, or cancerous. The risk for cancer increases when:  a nodule is large the nodule appears to have lobes or a pointed surface you are a current or former smoker  you have a family history of lung cancer you've been exposed to asbestos you have a history of chronic obstructive lung disease you are over age 60  Next steps Next steps after finding
a spot on the lungs  A pulmonary nodule may be first detected on a chest X-ray. After that, you may need further testing to better characterize the nodule to help determine if it is benign or cancerous.  Your doctor may request information about your medical history and your history of smoking. Additionally, your doctor needs to know if you’ve been exposed to secondhand smoke or environmental chemicals.  The first step of the process is examining the size and shape of the nodule. The bigger the nodule, and the more irregular the shape, the greater the risk of it being cancerous.  A CT scan can provide a clear image of the nodule and give more information about the shape, size, and location. If the results from a CT scan reveal that a nodule is small and smooth, your doctor may monitor the nodule over time to see if it changes in size or shape. You’ll have to repeat the CT scan a few times at regular intervals. If the nodule doesn't grow larger or change over a two-year period, it's unlikely to be cancer.  In addition to a CT scan, your doctor may complete a tuberculin skin test to check for tuberculosis or draw your blood to rule out other causes.  If your doctor believes a pulmonary nodule is cancerous, they may order more tests. Diagnostic testing used to confirm or rule out cancer includes:  Positron emission tomography (PET scan):  These tests use radioactive glucose molecules to determine if the cells that make up the nodule, are dividing rapidly.  Biopsy: Your doctor may order a biopsy , especially if the results of the PET scan are inconclusive. During this procedure, a tissue sample is removed from the nodule. It’s then examined for cancer cells using a microscope.  Sometimes this is done by a needle biopsy which is inserted near the edge of your lung through the chest wall. Another option is a bronchoscopy where your doctor inserts a scope through the mouth or nose and passes it through your large airways to collect cells.  If a pulmonary nodule is cancerous, your doctor will determine the best course of treatment based on the stage and type of the cancer. Treatment options can include radiation or chemotherapy to kill and prevent the spread of cancer cells, or surgery to remove the tumor.  Outlook Outlook for pulmonary
nodules  In most cases, your doctor can safely say that the nodule isn’t cancer if it doesn’t increase in size and remains small over a period of two years. At that point, there is no need for further testing.  If the nodule is cancerous and there is only one, it is likely still in the early stages when treatment offers the best chance of cure.  In some cases, a cancerous pulmonary nodule represents a metastasis from a cancer that began in another part of the body. If that is the case treatment will depend on the original cancer.  Other causes of lung nodules are infections, inflammatory conditions, and benign tumors or cysts . If you have any of these underlying conditions your doctor may recommend treatment that will depend on the underlying condition.   READ THIS NEXT What Are the Effects of Psoriasis on the Lungs?

What are some causes? How often do people have lung nodules? And what are the chances that it's lung cancer ? It's important to state right away that the majority —at least 60 percent of lung nodules overall—are not cancerous. We will talk about these possible causes, but it's equally important to note that if a nodule is lung cancer there is still a good chance that it can be cured.         A nodule, by definition, is less than three centimeters in diameter, and at this size, many lung cancers are very curable. Yet even for lung cancers that are larger, the treatment and survival rates for lung cancer have improved significantly in just the past few years. A final point before beginning is to note that following through on getting a diagnosis is important even if you've never smoked. At the current time, there are more former smokers and never smokers who develop lung cancer , than people who smoke. What Are Lung Nodules? A lung nodule is defined as a “spot” on the lung that is three centimeters (about 1.5 inches) in diameter or less. These nodules are often referred to as "coin lesions" when described on an imaging test. If an abnormality is seen on an x-ray of the lungs is larger than three centimeters, it is considered a “ lung mass ” instead of a nodule and is more likely to be cancerous.   Lung nodules usually need to be at least one centimeter in size before they can be seen on a chest x-ray, whereas nodules as small as one to two millimeters may sometimes be seen on a CT scan. Prevalence Lung nodules are quite common and are found on one in 500 chest x-rays, and one in 100 CT scans of the chest.         Approximately 150,000 lung nodules are detected in people in the United States each year. Roughly half of people over the age of 50 who smoke will have nodules on a CT scan of their chest. If a potential nodule is seen on a chest x-ray, it is important to have a CT scan. Small cancers can be missed on a chest x-ray . Symptoms Most lung nodules do not cause any symptoms and are found “accidentally” or "incidentally" when a chest x-ray is done for some other reason. If symptoms are present, they may include a cough, coughing up blood, wheezing, shortness of breath, or respiratory infections if the nodule(s) is located near a major airway. Causes Lung nodules can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancer). The most common causes overall include granulomas (clumps of inflamed tissue due to an infection or inflammation) and hamartomas (benign lung tumors). The most common cause of malignant lung nodules includes lung cancer or cancers from other regions of the body that have spread to the lungs ( metastatic cancer ). Nodules can be broken down into a few major categories. Infections - Infectious causes of nodules may include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, and coccidiomycosis, and parasitic infections such as ascariasis (roundworms,) echinococcus (hydatid cysts) and paragonimous (liver flukes.) When the immune system "walls off" areas of infection it often forms granulomas.         Inflammation - Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , sarcoidosis , and Wegener's granulomatosis, as well as pneumoconioses such as silicosis can also lead to granulomas. Benign tumors - Benign lung tumors such as hamartomas (the most common benign lung tumor,) bronchial adenomas, fibromas, blastomas, neurofibromas, and hemangiomas. can show up as a nodule in the lungs on x-ray. Malignant tumors – Cancers that may appear as a nodule includes lung cancer, lymphomas , sarcomas, and carcinoid tumors. Metastases - Lung nodules may also be due to metastases from other cancers such as breast cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer.  Other benign nodules - Pulmonary infarctions (areas of lung tissue that have lost their blood supply,) blood vessel abnormalities (AV malformations,) atelectasis (collapse of part of a lung,) pulmonary fibrosis , and amyloidosis are all other possible causes of a lung nodule. Diagnosis The first thing your doctor will want to do if she sees a lung nodule on your x-ray is to obtain any previous x-rays you have had and compare them. If the nodule or nodules have been present for a long time, further tests may not be needed. If the nodule is new or you don’t have any prior x-rays to compare, further workup may be needed. If a nodule is found on a chest x-ray, the first step will usually be to do a CT scan of your chest. Other tests such as an MRI may be needed. At this point, your doctor will want to know your history as well as any risk factors you have for any type of lung nodules (see below.) For example, if you have recently traveled, a fungal infection may be more likely whereas if you have smoked, a malignant tumor may be more likely. Characteristics of the tumor as seen on your CT scan will also be evaluated. A PET scan is sometimes helpful in further defining a nodule. Unlike CT scans and MRI are "structural" tests. They can find lesions in the lungs but don't really give a measure of what is happening in a nodule. With a PET scan, a small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into your blood stream. Actively growing tumors take up more of the sugar which lights up on the exam. This can be helpful in distinguishing a growing tumor from a scar tissue as a growing tumor will take up more of the sugar. This is especially helpful for those who have had previous chest radiation, lung infections or surgery which may result in scar tissue. If a nodule does not appear to be growing or has characteristics of a benign tumor, (has "low probability" of being cancer) a "wait and watch" approach may sometimes be taken with a CT scan repeated after a certain period of time. Single solitary nodules that have remained unchanged for a period of two or more years do not generally need any further workup. Biopsy of Pulmonary Nodules Unfortunately, a lung biopsy is often needed to know for sure what is causing a nodule. Thankfully, newer and less invasive methods of sampling tissue are now often available. This may be important even if your doctor is fairly sure what is causing the nodule or nodules. An example is when nodules are thought to be metastatic cancer from another tumor such as breast cancer. Recent research suggests that even when a lung nodule is found in a person who might be expected to have lung metastases, only half of the nodules were metastases when biopsied. Up to 25 percent, rather, were a second primary lung cancer. Depending on the location of the nodule, a fine needle biopsy may be done. Sometimes an endobronchial ultrasound and biopsy can be done as part of a  bronchoscopy. At times an open biopsy may be needed. Even when this is the case, newer techniques, such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) can often be done instead of a thoracotomy. Benign vs. Malignant Nodules Overall, the likelihood that a lung nodule is cancer is 40 percent, but the risk of a lung nodule being cancerous varies considerably depending on several factors. In people less than 35 years of age, the chance that a lung nodule is cancer is less than one percent, whereas half of lung nodules in people over age 50 are malignant (cancerous). Other factors that raise or lower the risk that a lung nodule is cancer include: Size - Larger nodules are more likely to be cancerous than smaller ones. Smoking - Current and former smokers are more likely to have cancerous lung nodules than never smokers. Learn the percentage of smokers who get lung cancer. Occupation - Some occupational exposures raise the likelihood that a nodule is cancer. Medical history - Having a history of cancer increases the chance that a nodule could be malignant. Family histor y - Those who have nodules and a family history of lung cancer are more likely to have cancerous nodules than those without a family history. Symptoms - The chance that a nodule is lung cancer is greater if other signs or symptoms of lung cancer are present. Shape/appearance of the nodule - Smooth, round nodules are more likely to be benign, whereas “spiculated” nodules, or with irregular or lobular borders are more likely to be cancerous. Solid/non-solid - Nodules that are part solid rather than solid are more likely to be cancerous Growth - Cancerous lung nodules tend to grow fairly rapidly with an average doubling time of about four months, while benign nodules tend to remain the same size over time. Calcification - Lung nodules that are calcified are more likely to be benign. Cavitation - Nodules described as “cavitary,” meaning that the interior part of the nodule appears darker on x-rays, are more likely to be benign. Ground glass nodules - Nodules that are described as having a ground glass appearance are often a challenge and can be either benign or malignant. Due to this difficulty, a biopsy of these lesions is usually needed. The number of nodules - Those who have multiple nodules are more likely to have cancer than those who have a solitary or only a few pulmonary nodules. Location of the nodules - Lobules located in the right or left lower lobes or the right middle lobe of the lung are less likely to be cancerous than those located in the left or right upper lobes. Ethnicity and geographic location - If you have traveled outside the United States, a lung nodule is more likely to be benign. For example, ecent studies have found that lung nodules due to schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection, are fairly common in African migrants . Likewise, nodules related to fungal infections, such as coccidiomycosis are common in the Southwest. Indeterminate Lung Nodules The number of lung nodules that are read by radiologists as "indeterminate" has increased with the advent of lung cancer screening. Hearing that your nodule or nodules are indeterminate can be confusing. Isn't it obvious? Unfortunately, there are times when it is impossible on imaging tests alone to know whether a nodule is malignant—even after considering all of the factors above. In order to answer this question, a biopsy must be done. Thankfully, radiologists, surgeons, and pathologists together are finding less invasive methods of sampling tissue. To understand better why this question is so difficult, you may wish to learn more about the differences between benign and malignant tumors . Lung Cancer Screening Lung cancer screening in appropriate people has been found to decrease the mortality rate from lung cancer by 20 percent. But as with any screening test, there is the risk of false positives, and it's common to find nodules on CT screening. But finding nodules does not always mean cancer. In fact, studies thus far estimate that  only around five percent of nodules found on a first lung CT screening are cancerous. Treatment The treatment of lung nodules varies widely depending upon the cause, whether they are related to infections, inflammation, cancer, or other conditions. Most benign lung nodules, especially those that are present and haven’t changed over a period of a few years, can be left alone. A Word From Verywell If you've heard that you or a loved one have a lung nodule you are probably a combination of nervous and overwhelmed. There are so many different possibilities and some of these are frightening. It may help a little to consider that the majority of nodules are not cancer, and even those that are may be curable with surgery. If you decide to research your nodule in line it's important to note that the science is changing rapidly. Newer diagnostic techniques are becoming available as well as new treatments each year. Since medicine is changing so rapidly, It's important to be your own advocate in your medical care. If you aren't getting answers, ask more questions. Consider getting a second opinion regardless of what you hear. Finally, reach out to family and friends. If your nodule turns out to be lung cancer there is an active lung cancer community that will welcome you in. Sources: Gould, M., Donington, J., Lynch, W. et al.

The advent of lung cancer screening has the potential to save many lives. But as with a lot of tests, there are often “false positives” something suspicious is found that later on turns out to be nothing. What are the chances that a nodule found on screening is cancer ( malignant ) and how often are nodules instead benign (non-cancerous?)         First, it’s important to talk about what’s meant by lung cancer screening, as well as a few statistics. Lung Cancer Screening and Statistics For a long time, we have hoped for a screening test for lung cancer. After all, we have mammograms to look for breast cancer, pap smears to look for cervical cancer, and colonoscopies to look for colon cancer. The reason is simple. Often (but not always) cancers are most treatable in the early stages of the disease. That’s certainly true for lung cancer. The survival rate for people with stage 1 lung cancer is roughly 60 to 80 percent. This drops to less than 10 percent for those who are diagnosed with stage 4 of the disease. Unfortunately, a good 40 percent of people already have stage 4 (metastatic) lung cancer at the time of diagnosis. Stage 4 meaning that a cancer has spread to distant regions or the other lung, and is therefore, inoperable . Considering that lung cancer is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States that's a big problem.   How Effective Are CT Scans? But for some people, we now have a screening test. The U.S. National Lung Screening Trial found that screening CT scans (low-dose CT) lowered the death rate from lung cancer by 20 percent when certain individuals have yearly screening low-dose CT scans . This includes people who:         Are between the ages of 55 and 74 Have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking, and Continue to smoke, or have quit in the past 15 years. When counting up numbers, only about 6 percent of people meet the screening guidelines, but it's a start. And with that start comes a few problems. When a nodule is seen on screening — and that's pretty common — what's the chance that it's cancer? First, it helps to understand how common it is to find nodules on lung CT screening tests. Finding an abnormality on an x-ray or CT of the chest doesn’t necessarily mean cancer. In fact, it’s more likely to be something else — something that you would never know about and would never bother you if you hadn't had the scan. How Common Are Lung Nodules in People Screened for Lung Cancer? Since CT screening is relatively new, we haven't known exactly how common nodules are. An estimate found that at least 20 percent of people (individuals who were screened based on the guidelines above) had at least one nodule that required further testing. Here it's important to make a distinction between what a radiologist may call a mass and what she refers to as a nodule. A mass refers to an abnormality greater than 3 cm (about 1 1/2 inches) in diameter.          The term nodule is used to describe abnormalities less than 3 cm in size. How Often Are Lung Pulmonary Nodules Found on Screening Cancerous? So if you get that dreaded call, the one in which your doctor says " we found a nodule on your screening CT ," how worried should you be? In the National Lung Cancer Screening trial, between 1 and 4 percent of people required invasive testing to follow-up their CT scans. Among those who had surgery, 25 percent of the nodules turned out to be benign. Looking at this a different way, In a more recent evaluation researchers looked at people in 2 separate studies.  In one of these (the Pan-American Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan,) 7008 nodules were found among 1871 people. Of these 102 were cancerous. In the other (a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) study,) 5001 nodules were found in 1090 people, with 42 being malignant. Crunching the numbers, this comes down to 5.5 percent of the people in one study and 3.7 percent in the other who had nodules that turned out to be cancerous. At this point, it’s important to note that these numbers — the likelihood that a nodule is cancerous —  are for healthy people without symptoms who are being screened. The likelihood of a nodule being malignant may be different for those who have symptoms. It may also be different for those who have a pulmonary nodule on screening but do not meet the criteria noted above. When is a Nodule More Likely to Be Cancer? Looking at studies to date, pulmonary nodules found on CT screening were more likely to be cancerous if: They were in the left or right upper lobes, and less likely to be malignant if they were in the right or left lower lobes, or in the right middle lobe. There was speculation of the nodule (meaning that instead of the abnormal area being round, it had spike like areas sticking out from the tumor,) or if the borders were irregular or lobulated. If they were larger. If they occurred in older people more than in younger people. If an individual had a family history of lung cancer. If they occurred in women more often than men. With increasing size of the nodule. In people with a history of emphysema. In people with fewer nodules. In addition: Part solid nodules were more likely to be cancerous than solid nodules. Solid nodules were more likely to be cancerous than non-solid nodules or nodules with a "ground glass" appearance. What Is My Nodule If It Isn’t Cancer? There are many causes of nodules ranging from infections to tuberculosis , to nodules associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and more. The following article discusses several benign and malignant causes of pulmonary nodules . Calculating Risk A lung cancer calculator is available for physicians (and the public) to estimate the chances that a nodule found on screening CT is malignant. This Nodule Prediction Calculator was developed based on scientific research, but people are cautioned that it's not a substitute for a physician's advice or treatment. The disclaimer people are asked to read emphasizes a very important point: Not all nodules that are high risk are cancer, and not all nodules that are low risk benign. Where Do You Go From Here? If your doctor determines that you have a pulmonary nodule or nodules, there are several approaches she may recommend. These will depend on several things including your risk factors for lung cancer, the appearance of the nodule, the location of the nodule, and your personal preference. Some options may include: A PET Scan A Bronchoscopy Watchful waiting A biopsy (There are several ways that a nodule may be biopsied depending upon its location.) Sources: Croswell, J. et al.

In the United States, lung cancer is the most fatal cancer in women, having passed breast cancer in 1987 as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. It is also the most fatal cancer in men , killing more men than prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer combined. Overall, 27 percent of cancer deaths in the U.S. are due to lung cancer.         An overview of the stages of lung cancer. Before anyone dismisses these numbers as due to smoking alone, it's important to point out that even if smoking were banned today, we would still have lung cancer. Lung cancer in never-smokers is the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In fact, the focus on smoking cessation as a way to treat lung cancer has, in some ways, overshadowed research looking into other causes.          List  These Are the 10 Most Fatal Cancers for Men           Article  What Are the Major Types of Lung Cancer?       What Is Lung Cancer? Lung cancer originates in the tissues of the lungs or the cells lining the airways (the bronchi). These cells begin as and look like lung cancer cells under the microscope, with the exception of changes that occur in the process of becoming cancerous. If lung cancer spreads to other regions of the body, the cells are still lung cancer cells. For example, if lung cancer spreads to the brain, cells taken from the metastasis (growth) in the brain would be identifiable as cancerous lung cancer cells under the microscope. In contrast, some tumors begin in other parts of the body and spread (metastasize) to the lungs.         This is referred to as metastatic cancer to the lungs and not lung cancer. An example would be a breast cancer which spreads to the lungs. This would not be called lung cancer, but rather "breast cancer metastatic to the lungs." Anatomy of Lung Cancer Lung cancer may occur anywhere in the lungs. The right lung is made up of three lobes and the left lung, two lobes. When we take a breath of air, it enters through our nose and mouth, passes down through the trachea (the windpipe) and then into the mainstem bronchus. It then travels via a bronchus to either the right or the left lung. Once in the bronchi, the air then travels through increasingly smaller bronchioles and on into the alveoli —tiny air sacs in the lungs through which the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen takes place. Capillaries (the smallest of blood vessels) surround the alveoli, receiving the oxygen to carry it to the rest of the body. Cancer may occur anywhere in the respiratory system from the large bronchi down to the alveoli.          List  Causes and Rates of Lung Cancer From Different Countries           Article  What Is the Meaning of a Cancer Latency Period?       Where Is Lung Cancer Most Common? Unfortunately, lung cancer is common throughout the world. Overall, the countries with the most lung cancer worldwide include Hungary, Serbia, and Korea. Looking at lung cancer in women, however, the highest incidence is found in Denmark, followed closely by Canada and then the United States. Who Gets Lung Cancer? The average age for lung cancer is 70, and 80 percent of people who develop lung cancer have smoked, but: Lung cancer occurs in women - Women are actually much more likely to die from lung cancer than breast cancer, and the incidence of lung cancer in women has almost caught up with that in men. In 2016 it's estimated that 85,920 men and 72,160 women will die from lung cancer. In comparison, 40,450 women will die from breast cancer. Lung cancer occurs in non-smokers - And while lung cancer in men who have smoked is decreasing, lung cancer in non-smokers is increasing. It's estimated that 20 percent of women who develop lung cancer in the U.S. have never smoked, and that number increases to 50 percent worldwide.         Lung cancer occurs in young adults - It's estimated that 13.4 percent of lung cancers occur in adults under the age of 40. While this number may seem small, when compared to the incidence of lung cancer overall, it is not. Calculating this out, around 21,000 young adults will die from lung cancer this year (again comparing this to 40,450 breast cancer deaths for women of all ages.) In addition, women are more likely than men to develop lung cancer at a young age, and lung cancer in young adults is increasing. Types of Lung Cancer There are two primary types of lung cancer: Non-small cell lung cancer is most common, being responsible for 80 to 85 percent of cancers. This is the type of lung cancer more commonly found in non-smokers, women, and young adults. Small cell lung cancer is responsible for around 15 percent of lung cancers. These lung cancers tend to be aggressive and may not be found until they have already spread (especially to the brain). They usually respond fairly well to chemotherapy but have a poor prognosis.          Article  What's the Survival Rate for Each Stage of Lung Cancer?           Article  Cancer Cells vs. Normal Cells: How Are They Different?       Non-small cell lung cancer is further broken down into three types: Lung adenocarcinoma - Lung adenocarcinoma is responsible for half of non-small cell lung cancers and is currently the most common type of lung cancer. It is also the most common type of lung cancer found in women, young adults, and in people who do not smoke. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs - Squamous cell lung cancer was once the most common type of lung cancer, but its incidence has decreased in recent years. Part of the thought is that the addition of filters to cigarettes created this shift. Squamous cell cancers tend to occur in or near the large airways - the first place exposed to smoke from a cigarette. Lung adenocarcinomas, in contrast, are usually found deeper in the lungs, where smoke from a filtered cigarette would settle. Large cell lung cancer - Large cell carcinomas of the lungs tend to grow in the outer regions of the lungs. These are usually rapidly growing tumors that spread quickly. Other, less common types of lung cancer include carcinoid tumors and neuroendocrine tumors. Signs and Symptoms of Lung Cancer Having an awareness of the early signs and symptoms of lung cancer is a must for everyone for two reasons: There is not a screening test available for everyone, so the only way that most people have to find these cancers early—when they are most treatable—is knowing the signs. Recent research tells us that the majority of people in the United States are not familiar with these symptoms. Because lung cancer is common. As noted earlier, lung cancer is the leading cause of death in both men and women and anyone who has lungs is at risk. Overall, the most common symptoms include: shortness of breath with activity a persistent cough coughing up blood unexplained weight loss chest pain Of note is that the types of lung cancer have been changing over the years, and with that, the most common symptoms. In the past, lung cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer were most common. These cancers tend to grow near the large airways of the lungs and cause symptoms early on—commonly a cough and coughing up blood. Now, lung adenocarcinoma, a tumor which tends to grow in the outer regions of the lungs is most common. These cancers tend to grow for a long time before causing symptoms, which may include mild shortness of breath, subtle weight loss, and a general sense of being unwell. Diagnosis and Staging A combination of imaging studies, including CT, MRI, and PET scans may be used to diagnose lung cancer. In addition, a lung biopsy is usually needed to determine the type of lung cancer. Careful staging—figuring out how extensive a lung cancer is—is important in designing a treatment regimen. Non-small cell lung cancer is broken down into five stages: stage 0 to stage IV. Small cell lung cancer is broken down into only two stages: limited stage and extensive stage. Causes of Lung Cancer Certainly, smoking is an important cause of lung cancer, but noting the statistics above, there are other important causes of lung cancer as well. Radon exposure in the home is the second leading cause of lung cancer and the most common cause in non-smokers. Any home in the United States (or anywhere in the world for that matter) is potentially at risk, and the only way to know is to do radon testing. Radon is an odorless, colorless gas that results from the normal decay of uranium in the soil beneath our homes. It's estimated that 27,000 radon-induced lung cancer deaths occur yearly in the U.S. alone and that 15 percent of cancers worldwide are related to radon exposure. Another 7,000 lung cancer deaths occur each year due to secondhand smoke. Other causes and possible causes include occupational exposures, air pollution, wood smoke, and cooking with poor ventilation. Recently it's been found that human papillomavirus (HPV)—the virus which causes cervical cancer—is associated with some lung cancers, though it's not at all certain if this may be a factor in the cause. How Does Lung Cancer Begin? Lung cancer usually begins several years before it causes symptoms and is diagnosed. Cells in the lungs may become cancer cells after going through a series of mutations which transform them into cancer cells. Gene mutations—or changes in the DNA of the cells—may be inherited (as a hereditary predisposition ) or acquired (damaged as the result of exposure to carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) in the environment. This accumulation of mutations is one of the reasons for a common finding with lung cancer: Many people develop lung cancer though they have never smoked, and some people smoke their whole life and never develop lung cancer. Lung cancer begins—a tumor originates—when a mass of cancer cells becomes immortal in a way; cells dividing and multiplying out of control. Our normal cells are regulated by a series of checks and balances. How Does Lung Cancer Grow and Spread One of the differences between benign lung tumors and lung cancer, as noted, is that lung cancer cells have the ability to break off and spread to other regions of the body. This spread, in fact, is the cause of most cancer deaths. One of the differences between cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells lack "stickiness." Normal cells produce substances that cause them to stay together. Without this stickiness, lung cancer cells can travel and grow in other regions, as well as invade nearby structures. There are four primary ways in which lung cancers spread . It can "invade" tissues locally. Unlike benign tumors which may push up against nearby tissues, cancers actually penetrate nearby tissues. This is the reason for the name "cancer," which is derived from the word crab; cancer can send crablike extensions into nearby tissues. Lung cancer cells can also break away and spread through either the bloodstream or the lymphatic system to distant sites. In recent years, it's also been found that lung cancer may travel and spread through the airways in the lungs. Does Lung Cancer Ever Just Go Away? Though it is very rare, lung cancer does, in some cases, just go away. This phenomenon is referred to as spontaneous remission of cancer. Researchers are tapping into this discovery to learn how our immune systems ordinarily function to remove cancer cells, and design treatments based on this principle. Lung Cancer Screening Until recently, we did not have a screening test for lung cancer, but that has changed. It's important to note that chest x-rays are not an adequate screening test as these fail to pick up lung cancers at a stage early enough to improve survival. Lung cancer CT screening is now recommended for people who: are between the ages of 55 and 80 smoked for at least 30 pack-years (a pack year is calculated by multiplying the number of packages of cigarettes smoked daily times the number of years smoked) continue to smoke or quit in the past 15 years For people with other risk factors, such as a family history of lung cancer, a history of COPD, or other risk factors for lung cancer, screening may also be considered. It's estimated that if everyone who qualified for screening underwent these tests, the mortality rate from lung cancer could be decreased by 20 percent. Where Does Lung Cancer Spread? The most common sites of lung cancer metastases include the brain, the bones, the liver, and the adrenal glands. Some types of lung cancer—for example, small cell lung cancer—are often diagnosed after the cancer has already spread. Lung cancer is also somewhat unique in that it can spread to the bones of the hand and feet. Lung Cancer Treatments Treatment options for lung cancer have improved significantly in recent years. These include: Surgery - There are several types of lung cancer surgery which may be done, depending on the size and location of a tumor. Radiation therapy - Radiation therapy may be given as an adjunct to surgery, to decrease pain or airway obstruction due to a cancer, or in high doses to a localized region in an attempt to cure cancer (stereotactic body radiotherapy.) Chemotherapy - Chemotherapy usually uses a combination of medications to treat lung cancer. Targeted therapies - Everyone with lung cancer should have molecular profiling (gene testing) done on their tumors. Targeted therapy drugs are currently available for people who bear tumors with several genetic mutations including EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, and ROS1 rearrangements. Contact your oncologist for an updated list of mutations. Immunotherapy - In 2015, two immunotherapy drugs were approved for the treatment of lung cancer. In some cases, these drugs have resulted in long-term survival even for those with the advanced stages of lung cancer. A relatively new type of cancer care is termed palliative care. Palliative care is care designed to address the full spectrum of medical needs for people with cancer, including physical, emotional, and spiritual support. Unlike hospice care, palliative care can be used for anyone, even if you have a cancer which is considered curable. Early studies have found that, in addition to improving the quality of life for people, this care may also improve survival. Alternative forms of treatment such as acupuncture may help people cope with symptoms that come with cancer and cancer treatments. These integrative treatments are now available at many cancer centers. If You Have Recently Been Diagnosed With Lung Cancer If you have only recently been told you have lung cancer, you are probably very frightened and not a little overwhelmed. Learning as much as you can about your cancer can help you feel more in control of your treatment, and help you play an active role in your care. Research your cancer. Reach out to friends and family and allow them to help you with things you can delegate. Learn how to advocate for yourself as a cancer patient . You may feel isolated as you face something nobody in your group of loved ones can understand. Participating in cancer support groups and communities may allow you to connect with others who are walking a similar road. These groups are also a good way to stay updated on the latest research about lung cancer. Take a moment to pamper yourself, and forgive yourself if you are feeling out of sorts. Nobody really knows how they will feel until they are diagnosed. The emotions you experience may span the spectrum from sadness to anger, to intense anxiety—sometimes in just a matter of minutes. Check out these first steps for when you are newly diagnosed . If Your Loved One Has Lung Cancer If it is your loved one rather than yourself who has been diagnosed with lung cancer, it can sometimes be even harder to cope. On top of the diagnosis, you may feel totally helpless as to what to do. At the same time that you are struggling with fears and sadness, the emotions your loved one is experiencing can be confusing and even heartbreaking. Check out these thoughts about " when your loved one has lung cancer " in which people who have lived with the disease share what they wish their loved ones had known. A Word From Verywell The face of lung cancer is changing. For many years, people living with lung cancer have had to cope with not only the stigma of lung cancer being a "smoker's disease" but the myth that it is uniformly fatal. This stigma is changing as the public becomes more aware that anyone with lungs can get lung cancer. The survival stigma is changing as well, as the public is learning of newer and better treatments that have recently ​been approved. In addition to the many new treatments approved in the past few years alone, there are over 100 medications being studied in clinical trials for lung cancer. We still have a way to go, but many people are surviving—and thriving—while living with this disease. There is a lot of hope. Sources: American Cancer Society.

istockphoto.com       More in Lung Cancer        Diagnosis       Non-Small Cell     Small Cell     Symptoms     Causes & Risk Factors     Treatment     Living With     Support & Coping        The diagnosis of lung cancer may begin with a chest x-ray, but since this test can miss early cancers, a chest CT scan, and eventually a biopsy if a nodule or mass is found, is needed. Lung cancer is often suspected after an abnormal spot is found on a chest x-ray done to evaluate a cough or chest pain. During this frightening time, it is helpful to know some of the procedures that may be recommended to find out if the abnormality is benign (non-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous).         If the abnormality is malignant, further studies are done to see if the cancer has spread ( metastasized ) to other areas in the body and to figure out the stage of the disease. Lung Cancer Screening For those without symptoms, lung cancer screening has now been approved for early detection in people who are between the ages of 55 and 80, have smoked for at least 30 pack-years, and smoke or quit smoking within the past 15 years. It's important to note, however, that screening is meant to be a test performed for those who do not have any symptoms. If you have any possible symptoms of lung cancer, further tests, including a full CT scan will be needed. Lung "Spots" and Other Descriptions Before going into the diagnosis of lung cancer, you may be feeling overwhelmed by your symptoms, and any abnormality your doctor has seen or will see on an x-ray or CT scan. As a quick review, As a quick review, a lung nodule is considered a "spot" on the lung that is 3 cm (an inch and a half) or less in diameter.   A lung mass refers to an abnormality that is larger than 3 cm in diameter. A spot on the lung or a "lung lesion" could be both benign or malignant. A "shadow" on an x-ray could also be benign or malignant, or simply the overlapping of normal structures in the chest. History and Physical When lung cancer is suspected, a physician will first perform a thorough history and physical exam.         This is done to evaluate symptoms and risk factors for lung cancer , and to look for any physical signs suggestive of lung cance r. These can include abnormal lung sounds, enlarged lymph nodes , unintentional weight loss, or clubbing of the fingernails (chubby fingernails). Laboratory and Radiology Studies A number of different imaging studies may be needed, depending on your specific symptoms and findings on exam. These may include: Chest X-Ray A chest x-ray is usually the first test performed to evaluate any concerns based on a careful history and physical.This may show a mass in the lungs or enlarged lymph nodes. Sometimes the chest x-ray is normal, and further tests are needed look for a suspected lung cancer. Even if a mass is found, these are not always cancerous and further studies are needed. It should be stressed that a chest x-ray alone is not sufficient to rule out lung cancer, and early cancers can easily be missed with these tests. CT scan A CT scan (computerized tomography) is frequently the second step either to follow up on an abnormal chest x-ray finding or to evaluate troublesome symptoms in those with a normal chest x-ray. CT scanning involves a series of x-rays that create a 3-dimensional view of the lungs.         If the CT is abnormal, the diagnosis of lung cancer still needs confirmation through a sample of tissue by one of the procedures below. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) For some people, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) will be used to evaluate the possibility of lung cancer. This procedure uses magnetism and does not involve radiation. Certain individuals, such as those with metal implants (pacemakers, etc) should not have MRI scans. The technician will ask questions to make sure these are not present. PET Scan A PET scan (positron emission tomography) uses radioactive material to create colorful 3-dimensional images of a region of the body.  This type of scan differs from the others in that it defines tumors that are actively growing. A small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into the bloodstream, and given time to be taken up by cells. Cells that are actively growing take up more sugar, and light up on films. The test is usually combined with a CT scan (PET/CT). As an addition to the other procedures, some researchers suggest that PET scanning may detect tumors earlier, even before they are visible anatomically through other studies. PET scans are also useful for distinguishing between tumors and scar tissue in people who have scarring in their lungs for any reason. Sputum Cytology After a lung cancer is suspected based on imaging, a sample of tissue is required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of cancer. Sputum cytology is the easiest way to do this, but its use is limited to those tumors that extend into the airways. Sputum cytology is not always accurate and can miss some cancer cells. The test is of most benefit when positive, but says little if it is negative. Bronchoscopy In a bronchoscopy , a lung specialist inserts a tube into the airways to visualize and take a sample of the tumor. This procedure is used when the tumor is found in the large airways and can be reached by the scope. Patients are given anesthesia during this procedure to minimize discomfort. During a bronchoscopy, a biopsy may be taken of any tumor or other abnormalities that are seen in the airways. Endobronchial Ultrasound Endobronchial ultrasound is a relatively new technique for diagnosing lung cancer. During a bronchoscopy, physicians use an ultrasound probe within the airway to examine the lungs and area between the lungs (mediastinum). For tumors that relatively close to the airways, a biopsy may be done with this imaging. Needle Biopsy In a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, a physician inserts a hollow needle through the chest wall, usually guided by CT visualization, to take a sample of the tumor. This can be performed for tumors that cannot be reached by bronchoscopy, especially those that are near the periphery of the lungs. Thoracentesis When lung cancer affects the periphery of the lungs, it can cause fluid to build up between the lungs and the lung lining (the pleura.) With local anesthesia, a larger needle is inserted into the pleural cavity from which either a diagnostic amount of fluid (small amount to test for cancer cells, a malignant pleural effusion ) or a therapeutic amount of fluid (large amount to improve pain and/or shortness of breath) is removed. Mediastinoscopy A mediastinoscopy This procedure is done in the operating room under general anesthesia. A scope is inserted just above the sternum (the breast bone) into the region between the lungs ( the mediastinum ) to take tissue samples from lymph nodes. A PET scan can now often provide the same results that a mediastinoscopy did in the past. Test to Determine if Lung Cancer Has Spread (Metastasized) Lung cancer most commonly spreads to the liver , the adrenal glands, the brain and the bones. Common tests include: CT scan of the abdomen: To check for spread to the liver or adrenal glands MRI of the brain: To look for metastases to the brain Bone scan : To test for metastases to bones , especially the back, hips, and ribs PET scan: A PET scan can look for metastases essentially anywhere in the body, and can sometimes replace other tests above such as a bone scan or CT scans. Other Tests During Diagnosis Additional non-diagnostic tests are frequently performed during the diagnosis of lung cancer as well. These can include: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): PFTs test lung capacity and can determine how much the tumor is interfering with breathing, and sometimes, whether it is safe to perform surgery Blood tests: Certain blood tests can detect biochemical abnormalities caused by lung cancers, and can also suggest spread of the tumor Lung Biopsy If a lung cancer is suspected on imaging studies, the next step is to have a lung biopsy done to determine whether or not the abnormality is truly cancer, and to determine the type of lung cancer. Most biopsies are done on tissue samples, but liquid biopsies are an exciting new way to follow some people with lung cancer.  Approved in June of 2016, these tests can be done via a simple blood draw. At the time, they are only approved for detecting EGFR mutations, but for everyone, they are a good example of how the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is improving every year. When a lung cancer spreads, it is important to "re-biopsy" tissue, as cancers can change in time, and these changes can, in turn, help you and your doctor choose the best treatment options. Molecular Profiling/Gene Testing It's now recommended that everyone with non-small cell lung cancer, and especially lung adenocarcinoma, have molecular profiling done on their tumor. This gene testing looks for mutations in cancer cells for which specific medications are available which "target" those mutations. These are not mutations that you are born with, nor can you pass them on to your children. They are mutations that occur in the process of a cell becoming cancerous and which "drive" the growth of a cancer. Targeted treatments are currently approved for people with EGFR mutations , ALK rearrangements , ROS1 rearrangements , and a few other mutations. In addition, other treatments are currently being studied in clinical trials . PD-L1 Testing Since the first immunotherapy drug was approved for the treatment of lung cancer in 2015, 3 additional medications have become available. A test referred to as PD-L1 may be done to determine the percent of expression of PD-L1 on your cancer cells. PD-L1 is a protein that is expressed in greater amounts on some lung cancer cells. This protein serves to enhance the "brakes" of the immune system, reducing its ability to fight off cancer cells. Some cancer cells have found ways to "overexpress" this protein as a method of hiding from the immune system. Medications known as checkpoint inhibitors work by blocking this action and essentially releasing the brakes on the immune system. We still don't know how important PD-L1 testing will be in the treatment of lung cancer. Both lung cancers which overexpress PD-L1 and those that don't may respond to these drugs. At the current time it's thought that it may be cost-effective to do these tests, but limiting the use of these drugs only to people who have tumors that overexpress PD-L1 could reduce the number of people who would benefit from these drugs.

The advent of lung cancer screening has the potential to save many lives. But as with a lot of tests, there are often “false positives” something suspicious is found that later on turns out to be nothing. What are the chances that a nodule found on screening is cancer ( malignant ) and how often are nodules instead benign (non-cancerous?)         First, it’s important to talk about what’s meant by lung cancer screening, as well as a few statistics. Lung Cancer Screening and Statistics For a long time, we have hoped for a screening test for lung cancer. After all, we have mammograms to look for breast cancer, pap smears to look for cervical cancer, and colonoscopies to look for colon cancer. The reason is simple. Often (but not always) cancers are most treatable in the early stages of the disease. That’s certainly true for lung cancer. The survival rate for people with stage 1 lung cancer is roughly 60 to 80 percent. This drops to less than 10 percent for those who are diagnosed with stage 4 of the disease. Unfortunately, a good 40 percent of people already have stage 4 (metastatic) lung cancer at the time of diagnosis. Stage 4 meaning that a cancer has spread to distant regions or the other lung, and is therefore, inoperable . Considering that lung cancer is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States that's a big problem.   How Effective Are CT Scans? But for some people, we now have a screening test. The U.S. National Lung Screening Trial found that screening CT scans (low-dose CT) lowered the death rate from lung cancer by 20 percent when certain individuals have yearly screening low-dose CT scans . This includes people who:         Are between the ages of 55 and 74 Have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking, and Continue to smoke, or have quit in the past 15 years. When counting up numbers, only about 6 percent of people meet the screening guidelines, but it's a start. And with that start comes a few problems. When a nodule is seen on screening — and that's pretty common — what's the chance that it's cancer? First, it helps to understand how common it is to find nodules on lung CT screening tests. Finding an abnormality on an x-ray or CT of the chest doesn’t necessarily mean cancer. In fact, it’s more likely to be something else — something that you would never know about and would never bother you if you hadn't had the scan. How Common Are Lung Nodules in People Screened for Lung Cancer? Since CT screening is relatively new, we haven't known exactly how common nodules are. An estimate found that at least 20 percent of people (individuals who were screened based on the guidelines above) had at least one nodule that required further testing. Here it's important to make a distinction between what a radiologist may call a mass and what she refers to as a nodule. A mass refers to an abnormality greater than 3 cm (about 1 1/2 inches) in diameter.          The term nodule is used to describe abnormalities less than 3 cm in size. How Often Are Lung Pulmonary Nodules Found on Screening Cancerous? So if you get that dreaded call, the one in which your doctor says " we found a nodule on your screening CT ," how worried should you be? In the National Lung Cancer Screening trial, between 1 and 4 percent of people required invasive testing to follow-up their CT scans. Among those who had surgery, 25 percent of the nodules turned out to be benign. Looking at this a different way, In a more recent evaluation researchers looked at people in 2 separate studies.  In one of these (the Pan-American Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan,) 7008 nodules were found among 1871 people. Of these 102 were cancerous. In the other (a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) study,) 5001 nodules were found in 1090 people, with 42 being malignant. Crunching the numbers, this comes down to 5.5 percent of the people in one study and 3.7 percent in the other who had nodules that turned out to be cancerous. At this point, it’s important to note that these numbers — the likelihood that a nodule is cancerous —  are for healthy people without symptoms who are being screened. The likelihood of a nodule being malignant may be different for those who have symptoms. It may also be different for those who have a pulmonary nodule on screening but do not meet the criteria noted above. When is a Nodule More Likely to Be Cancer? Looking at studies to date, pulmonary nodules found on CT screening were more likely to be cancerous if: They were in the left or right upper lobes, and less likely to be malignant if they were in the right or left lower lobes, or in the right middle lobe. There was speculation of the nodule (meaning that instead of the abnormal area being round, it had spike like areas sticking out from the tumor,) or if the borders were irregular or lobulated. If they were larger. If they occurred in older people more than in younger people. If an individual had a family history of lung cancer. If they occurred in women more often than men. With increasing size of the nodule. In people with a history of emphysema. In people with fewer nodules. In addition: Part solid nodules were more likely to be cancerous than solid nodules. Solid nodules were more likely to be cancerous than non-solid nodules or nodules with a "ground glass" appearance. What Is My Nodule If It Isn’t Cancer? There are many causes of nodules ranging from infections to tuberculosis , to nodules associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and more. The following article discusses several benign and malignant causes of pulmonary nodules . Calculating Risk A lung cancer calculator is available for physicians (and the public) to estimate the chances that a nodule found on screening CT is malignant. This Nodule Prediction Calculator was developed based on scientific research, but people are cautioned that it's not a substitute for a physician's advice or treatment. The disclaimer people are asked to read emphasizes a very important point: Not all nodules that are high risk are cancer, and not all nodules that are low risk benign. Where Do You Go From Here? If your doctor determines that you have a pulmonary nodule or nodules, there are several approaches she may recommend. These will depend on several things including your risk factors for lung cancer, the appearance of the nodule, the location of the nodule, and your personal preference. Some options may include: A PET Scan A Bronchoscopy Watchful waiting A biopsy (There are several ways that a nodule may be biopsied depending upon its location.) Sources: Croswell, J. et al.

To be considered a lung nodule, the growth usually has to be smaller than 3 centimeters. Lung nodules are either considered noncancerous or cancerous. A noncancerous nodule is called benign, and a cancerous lung nodule is referred to as malignant.  Growths that are larger than 3 centimeters are usually called lung masses and typically have a higher chance of being cancerous.   Causes   A small growth on the lung is called a lung nodule. They are very common and may often be benign.   Although it can be frightening for an individual to be told they have a growth in their lung, a lung nodule does not always indicate lung cancer .  Lung nodules are very common. According to the American Thoracic Society, lung nodules can be found on up to 50 percent of adult chest imaging scans. The good news is fewer than 5 percent of lung nodules end up being cancer .  Noncancerous lung nodules can have a variety of causes, including:    Infection : Infections, such as tuberculosis , can cause inflammation . A group of cells called a granuloma may form around the inflamed area in the lung.   Non-infectious inflammation : Inflammation that is not related to an infection can also develop in the lung. For instance, rheumatoid arthritis can lead to inflammation in the lungs that results in a nodule.   Non-cancerous tumors : Non-cancerous growths, such as a fibroma, which is a benign growth of connective tissue, may also develop in the lung.   Although most lung nodules are not cancer, some do turn out to be malignant.  Certain risk factors that increase the chances a lung nodule are associated with cancer. For example, someone who has a history of smoking, is older than 60, or has a family history of cancer has a higher risk of a nodule being cancer.  Larger lung nodules are also more likely to be cancerous.             Symptoms  A lung nodule itself does not often cause any symptoms. Nodules are usually not large enough to interfere with breathing.  In some instances, however, symptoms of the condition that caused the nodule may be present. For example, if a lung nodule is due to lung cancer, symptoms may include:   shortness of breath  chest pain  coughing up blood  back pain  weight loss    Diagnosis   A CT scan may be performed after an initial X-ray to provide a more detailed image of a lung nodule.   A lung nodule usually shows up on a chest X-ray or a CT scan that has been carried out on a person who has symptoms of a respiratory illness.  The nodule will show up as a spot or shadow on the X-ray. If the nodule was found on a chest X-ray, a CT scan may also be performed. This test can provide more detailed images than an X-ray.  After a lung nodule is discovered, the doctor will look at its size, shape, and general appearance. Certain features may suggest that the nodule is more likely to be cancerous. For example, the larger a growth is, the more likely it is to be cancer.  The location of the nodule, as well as the shape and size, may also increase the chances of it being cancerous. The doctor will also consider the person's medical history, including smoking history, to evaluate the chances of the growth being cancerous.  Biopsy  If a person's risk factors for lung cancer are small and features of the nodule suggest a low likelihood of cancer, doing a biopsy may cause more harm than good. A small lung nodule can be difficult to biopsy, and there are risks, such as bleeding or a collapsed lung.  When the features of the nodule suggest that it may be cancerous, a biopsy may be recommended. A biopsy involves removing a small amount of tissue from the nodule. The tissue can be obtained through a needle biopsy or a bronchoscopy.  Bronchoscopy  A bronchoscopy involves inserting a thin tube into the lung through the mouth or nose and down the windpipe. The tube has a small camera, which allows the doctor to view the nodule. Special tools are then used to obtain a tissue sample.  Needle biopsy  Another option is a needle biopsy, which involves inserting a needle into the lung through the chest wall. This procedure is usually done with a guided CT scan.  The type of procedure used to get the tissue sample depends on the size and location of the nodule. After the sample is obtained, the tissue is examined under a microscope to look for the presence of cancer cells.             Treatment  Treatment for lung nodules will often depend on whether the nodule has the features that suggest that it may be cancerous.  Treatment for a noncancerous nodule   A healthcare professional will be able to advise on the best action to take for both noncancerous and cancerous nodules as the treatments will vary.   If the nodule has characteristics that suggest a low chance of cancer, the doctor may recommend taking a wait-and-see approach. The nodule may be monitored with repeat CT imaging scans over time to watch for any changes.  Some doctors may suggest CT scans at regular intervals for a few years to make sure the nodule does not increase in size. The doctor will determine how frequently to perform a follow-up scan based on various factors, such as a person's risk of cancer and the size of the nodule.  If the lung nodule does not change over about 2 years, it is unlikely to be cancer, and further imaging may not be needed.  If a lung nodule is due to an active infection, treatment is based on the condition identified. For example, if the nodule is due to tuberculosis, treatment for the infection will be started.  Treatment for a cancerous nodule  When a lung nodule is cancer, it is most often due to lung cancer, lymphoma , or cancer that has spread to the lung from another organ. If it is determined through a biopsy that the nodule is cancerous, treatment options may vary based on the type and stage of the cancer.  In some instances, when a lung nodule is identified as cancerous, it may be removed through a surgical procedure called a thoracotomy. The procedure involves making a cut through the chest wall into the lung to remove the nodule.  Additional treatment for cancerous lung nodules may include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and additional surgical procedures.   Prevention and outlook  The outlook for people with a lung nodule that is cancerous varies depending on the stage of the disease. In many cases, if lung cancer is found early, the long-term outlook is good.  Lung nodules that are noncancerous have a good outlook and usually do not cause any complications.  Depending on the cause, it may not be possible to prevent lung nodules from occurring. A person can decrease their chances of developing a lung nodule due to lung cancer, however.  Smoking is one of the main risk factors for getting lung cancer. According to the American Lung Association , the main cause of lung cancer in both women and men is smoking. In fact, about 90 percent of lung cancer cases are associated with smoking. As a result, quitting smoking may help reduce the risk of developing lung nodules.

To be considered a lung nodule, the growth usually has to be smaller than 3 centimeters. Lung nodules are either considered noncancerous or cancerous. A noncancerous nodule is called benign, and a cancerous lung nodule is referred to as malignant.  Growths that are larger than 3 centimeters are usually called lung masses and typically have a higher chance of being cancerous.   Causes   A small growth on the lung is called a lung nodule. They are very common and may often be benign.   Although it can be frightening for an individual to be told they have a growth in their lung, a lung nodule does not always indicate lung cancer .  Lung nodules are very common. According to the American Thoracic Society, lung nodules can be found on up to 50 percent of adult chest imaging scans. The good news is fewer than 5 percent of lung nodules end up being cancer .  Noncancerous lung nodules can have a variety of causes, including:    Infection : Infections, such as tuberculosis , can cause inflammation . A group of cells called a granuloma may form around the inflamed area in the lung.   Non-infectious inflammation : Inflammation that is not related to an infection can also develop in the lung. For instance, rheumatoid arthritis can lead to inflammation in the lungs that results in a nodule.   Non-cancerous tumors : Non-cancerous growths, such as a fibroma, which is a benign growth of connective tissue, may also develop in the lung.   Although most lung nodules are not cancer, some do turn out to be malignant.  Certain risk factors that increase the chances a lung nodule are associated with cancer. For example, someone who has a history of smoking, is older than 60, or has a family history of cancer has a higher risk of a nodule being cancer.  Larger lung nodules are also more likely to be cancerous.             Symptoms  A lung nodule itself does not often cause any symptoms. Nodules are usually not large enough to interfere with breathing.  In some instances, however, symptoms of the condition that caused the nodule may be present. For example, if a lung nodule is due to lung cancer, symptoms may include:   shortness of breath  chest pain  coughing up blood  back pain  weight loss    Diagnosis   A CT scan may be performed after an initial X-ray to provide a more detailed image of a lung nodule.   A lung nodule usually shows up on a chest X-ray or a CT scan that has been carried out on a person who has symptoms of a respiratory illness.  The nodule will show up as a spot or shadow on the X-ray. If the nodule was found on a chest X-ray, a CT scan may also be performed. This test can provide more detailed images than an X-ray.  After a lung nodule is discovered, the doctor will look at its size, shape, and general appearance. Certain features may suggest that the nodule is more likely to be cancerous. For example, the larger a growth is, the more likely it is to be cancer.  The location of the nodule, as well as the shape and size, may also increase the chances of it being cancerous. The doctor will also consider the person's medical history, including smoking history, to evaluate the chances of the growth being cancerous.  Biopsy  If a person's risk factors for lung cancer are small and features of the nodule suggest a low likelihood of cancer, doing a biopsy may cause more harm than good. A small lung nodule can be difficult to biopsy, and there are risks, such as bleeding or a collapsed lung.  When the features of the nodule suggest that it may be cancerous, a biopsy may be recommended. A biopsy involves removing a small amount of tissue from the nodule. The tissue can be obtained through a needle biopsy or a bronchoscopy.  Bronchoscopy  A bronchoscopy involves inserting a thin tube into the lung through the mouth or nose and down the windpipe. The tube has a small camera, which allows the doctor to view the nodule. Special tools are then used to obtain a tissue sample.  Needle biopsy  Another option is a needle biopsy, which involves inserting a needle into the lung through the chest wall. This procedure is usually done with a guided CT scan.  The type of procedure used to get the tissue sample depends on the size and location of the nodule. After the sample is obtained, the tissue is examined under a microscope to look for the presence of cancer cells.             Treatment  Treatment for lung nodules will often depend on whether the nodule has the features that suggest that it may be cancerous.  Treatment for a noncancerous nodule   A healthcare professional will be able to advise on the best action to take for both noncancerous and cancerous nodules as the treatments will vary.   If the nodule has characteristics that suggest a low chance of cancer, the doctor may recommend taking a wait-and-see approach. The nodule may be monitored with repeat CT imaging scans over time to watch for any changes.  Some doctors may suggest CT scans at regular intervals for a few years to make sure the nodule does not increase in size. The doctor will determine how frequently to perform a follow-up scan based on various factors, such as a person's risk of cancer and the size of the nodule.  If the lung nodule does not change over about 2 years, it is unlikely to be cancer, and further imaging may not be needed.  If a lung nodule is due to an active infection, treatment is based on the condition identified. For example, if the nodule is due to tuberculosis, treatment for the infection will be started.  Treatment for a cancerous nodule  When a lung nodule is cancer, it is most often due to lung cancer, lymphoma , or cancer that has spread to the lung from another organ. If it is determined through a biopsy that the nodule is cancerous, treatment options may vary based on the type and stage of the cancer.  In some instances, when a lung nodule is identified as cancerous, it may be removed through a surgical procedure called a thoracotomy. The procedure involves making a cut through the chest wall into the lung to remove the nodule.  Additional treatment for cancerous lung nodules may include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and additional surgical procedures.   Prevention and outlook  The outlook for people with a lung nodule that is cancerous varies depending on the stage of the disease. In many cases, if lung cancer is found early, the long-term outlook is good.  Lung nodules that are noncancerous have a good outlook and usually do not cause any complications.  Depending on the cause, it may not be possible to prevent lung nodules from occurring. A person can decrease their chances of developing a lung nodule due to lung cancer, however.  Smoking is one of the main risk factors for getting lung cancer. According to the American Lung Association , the main cause of lung cancer in both women and men is smoking. In fact, about 90 percent of lung cancer cases are associated with smoking. As a result, quitting smoking may help reduce the risk of developing lung nodules.

These growths are among the abnormalities our doctors evaluate in the Lung Cancer Early Detection & Prevention Clinic , and they sometimes lead to a lung cancer diagnosis.  What is a pulmonary nodule?   A pulmonary nodule is a small, roundish growth on the lung that measures three centimeters in diameter or less. Most pulmonary nodules are extremely small, less than one centimeter across. If the growth is larger than three centimeters, it is called a pulmonary mass.  Though pulmonary nodules may grow to become a pulmonary mass, some nodules may not grow at all.  What causes pulmonary nodules?  There are many causes of pulmonary nodules, including:  Infections, such as fungal or bacterial infections  Noncancerous processes, such as sarcoidosis  Cancerous processes, such as lung cancer, lymphoma or cancer that has spread from other organs  The likelihood that a pulmonary nodule is lung cancer depends on:  Your age  Your smoking history  Your history of exposure to environmental risk factors  Generally, less than 1 in 10 pulmonary nodules turns out to be lung cancer.  Symptoms of pulmonary nodules  Because pulmonary nodules are small, they rarely cause any symptoms. Some people might experience symptoms of a respiratory infection, such as a chest cold or mild flu.  Most pulmonary nodules are discovered by accident, when a patient gets a chest X-ray or a computed tomography (CT) scan for some other reason.  Evaluating a pulmonary nodule  The immediate goal of evaluating a pulmonary nodule is to determine its potential to be cancerous. Your doctor will ask about your personal and medical history and your environmental-exposure history, and you may have a chest CT scan.  If your doctor thinks you have a nodule with significant cancer potential and the nodule is one centimeter across or larger, they will use diagnostic procedures to determine the cause of the nodule.   There are many noninvasive or minimally invasive methods, such as:  Positron emission tomography (PET) scans  Bronchoscopy  Endobronchial ultrasound  CT-guided needle biopsy  Biopsy guided by fluoroscopy (moving X-ray)  If your pulmonary nodule cannot be diagnosed using one of these approaches, you may need surgery, such as:  Video-assisted thoracic surgery, done through a series of small incisions using a scope with a camera to see inside your chest  Open-chest surgery (thoracotomy)  Mini-thoracotomy (open-chest surgery with a smaller incision)  Once your doctor knows the cause of your pulmonary nodule, they can recommend a treatment plan tailored to you. If you are diagnosed with lung cancer, learn more about lung cancer treatment .  Following a pulmonary nodule  Most pulmonary nodules are too small (less than one centimeter across) to be diagnosed safely and accurately using any of the procedures or tests currently available. Because these very small pulmonary nodules can represent early lung cancer, they need to be followed closely using CT scans to evaluate whether they grow over time. If the size of these nodules doesn’t change for two years, the chance that they represent lung cancer is very small.  Make an appointment  If you have been diagnosed with a pulmonary nodule or other abnormality that might be a sign of lung cancer, make an appointment for an evaluation at the Lung Cancer Early Detection & Prevention Clinic by calling (206) 606-6100.

Sign up now        Can lung nodules be cancerous? Answers from Eric J. Olson, M.D.    Yes, lung nodules can be cancerous, though most lung nodules are noncancerous (benign).  Lung nodules — small masses of tissue in the lung — are quite common. They appear as round, white shadows on a chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan.  Lung nodules are usually about 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) to 1.2 inches (30 millimeters) in size. A larger lung nodule, such as one that's 30 millimeters or larger, is more likely to be cancerous than is a smaller lung nodule.  If your doctor detects a lung nodule on an imaging test, it's helpful to compare your current imaging scan with a previous one. If the nodule on earlier images hasn't changed in size, shape or appearance in two years, it's probably noncancerous.  Noncancerous lung nodules are often caused by previous infections. Noncancerous lung nodules usually require no treatment. In some cases your doctor may recommend annual chest imaging to see if a lung nodule grows or changes over time.  If a lung nodule is new or has changed in size, shape or appearance, your doctor may recommend further testing — such as a CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, bronchoscopy or tissue biopsy — to determine if it's cancerous.

A pulmonary nodule is a small, roundish growth on the lung—sometimes called a spot
      on the lung—that is easy to find and hard to diagnose. Pulmonary nodules turn up in
      about one of every 500 chest x-rays. But because they can be a form of early-stage
      cancer, it’s important to distinguish a benign nodule from a cancerous nodule as early
      as possible. Therefore, doctors approach every pulmonary nodule as cancerous until
      they can prove otherwise.  If a spot on the lung has a diameter of three centimeters or less, it’s called a nodule.
      If it’s bigger than that, it’s called a mass and undergoes a different evaluation
      process. About 40 percent of pulmonary nodules turn out to be cancerous. Half of all
      patients treated for a cancerous pulmonary nodule live at least five years past the
      diagnosis. But if the nodule is one centimeter across or smaller, survival after five
      years rises to 80 percent. That’s why early detection is critical.  The Mechanics of Pulmonary Nodules  Benign pulmonary nodules are just that—benign. There is very little growth or change,
      if there’s any at all. Cancerous pulmonary nodules, however, are known to grow relatively
      quickly—usually doubling in size every four months but sometimes as fast as every
      25 days.  A cancerous nodule is a lesion or “sore” that steadily engulfs more and more of the
      structures of the lung. Over time the patient will experience shortness of breath,
      fatigue, and chest pain.  Symptoms of Pulmonary Nodules  The challenge in trying to identify pulmonary nodules before they become masses is
      that there are few, if any, symptoms to indicate a nodule might be present. The vast
      majority of pulmonary nodules—more than 90%—are discovered essentially by accident.
      They’re spotted incidentally in a chest x-ray or CT (computed tomography) scan performed
      for other purposes. If any symptoms do appear they tend to imitate characteristics
      common to a chest cold or a mild flu.  Causes of Pulmonary Nodules  Benign nodules are almost always healed over “wounds” on the lung left from tuberculosis
      or a fungal infection, although there are other, less common causes.  Cancerous nodules can be the first stage of a primary lung cancer, brought on by smoking
      or any other common cause of lung cancer. They also can be a secondary cancer that
      metastasized in the lungs from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.  Diagnosing Pulmonary Nodules  The diagnostic process focuses on determining whether a pulmonary nodule is cancerous
      or benign.  The most sure-fire way to make the distinction is by examining the growth rate of
      the nodule. Benign nodules do not grow much if at all. Cancerous nodules, on the other
      hand, can double in size on average every four months (some as quickly as 25 days,
      some as slowly as 15 months). Growth can be evaluated through a series of x-rays or
      CT (computed tomography) scans over a period of time.  The second most sure-fire way to distinguish a cancerous nodule from a benign nodule
      is to evaluate its calcification—that is, its development based on its shape and surface.
      Benign nodules tend to be smoother and more regularly shaped, with more even color
      throughout. Cancerous nodules are more likely to have irregular shapes, rougher surfaces,
      and color variations or speckled patterns.  In most cases, x-rays or CT scans provide enough information to make a reliable diagnosis.
      Doctors might choose to retrieve cells from the nodule for a biopsy. Cells are collected
      using a needle or performing localized surgery. In addition, an analysis of the patient’s
      sputum can provide diagnostic information.  Treating Pulmonary Nodules  In almost every case, benign pulmonary nodules require no treatment. Cancerous nodules,
      however, usually are treated by removing them surgically. Several surgical procedures
      are used, depending on the size, condition and location of the nodule:   Video-assisted thorocoscopic surgery is a procedure similar to “scoping” an injured knee. The surgeon inserts the thorascopic
         device into the lung and withdraws the offending nodule tissue.  A mini-thoracotomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that zeros in on the nodule. It is chosen
         instead of a full thoracotomy whenever possible.  A thoracotomy is a comprehensive, invasive procedure whose goal is removal of the diseased portion
         of the lung—sometime a sizeable “wedge” of the organ.   ABCs of Nodules Concerned about pulmonary nodules? Follow these ABCs: A is for Age —few cases before 35, most cases after 45. B is for Before —compare today’s x-rays with those taken before for any change. C is for Calcium —nodules get their revealing shapes as a result of calcification. And S is for Smoking —if you smoke, quit and get checked.

What are some causes? How often do people have lung nodules? And what are the chances that it's lung cancer ? It's important to state right away that the majority —at least 60 percent of lung nodules overall—are not cancerous. We will talk about these possible causes, but it's equally important to note that if a nodule is lung cancer there is still a good chance that it can be cured.         A nodule, by definition, is less than three centimeters in diameter, and at this size, many lung cancers are very curable. Yet even for lung cancers that are larger, the treatment and survival rates for lung cancer have improved significantly in just the past few years. A final point before beginning is to note that following through on getting a diagnosis is important even if you've never smoked. At the current time, there are more former smokers and never smokers who develop lung cancer , than people who smoke. What Are Lung Nodules? A lung nodule is defined as a “spot” on the lung that is three centimeters (about 1.5 inches) in diameter or less. These nodules are often referred to as "coin lesions" when described on an imaging test. If an abnormality is seen on an x-ray of the lungs is larger than three centimeters, it is considered a “ lung mass ” instead of a nodule and is more likely to be cancerous.   Lung nodules usually need to be at least one centimeter in size before they can be seen on a chest x-ray, whereas nodules as small as one to two millimeters may sometimes be seen on a CT scan. Prevalence Lung nodules are quite common and are found on one in 500 chest x-rays, and one in 100 CT scans of the chest.         Approximately 150,000 lung nodules are detected in people in the United States each year. Roughly half of people over the age of 50 who smoke will have nodules on a CT scan of their chest. If a potential nodule is seen on a chest x-ray, it is important to have a CT scan. Small cancers can be missed on a chest x-ray . Symptoms Most lung nodules do not cause any symptoms and are found “accidentally” or "incidentally" when a chest x-ray is done for some other reason. If symptoms are present, they may include a cough, coughing up blood, wheezing, shortness of breath, or respiratory infections if the nodule(s) is located near a major airway. Causes Lung nodules can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancer). The most common causes overall include granulomas (clumps of inflamed tissue due to an infection or inflammation) and hamartomas (benign lung tumors). The most common cause of malignant lung nodules includes lung cancer or cancers from other regions of the body that have spread to the lungs ( metastatic cancer ). Nodules can be broken down into a few major categories. Infections - Infectious causes of nodules may include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, and coccidiomycosis, and parasitic infections such as ascariasis (roundworms,) echinococcus (hydatid cysts) and paragonimous (liver flukes.) When the immune system "walls off" areas of infection it often forms granulomas.         Inflammation - Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , sarcoidosis , and Wegener's granulomatosis, as well as pneumoconioses such as silicosis can also lead to granulomas. Benign tumors - Benign lung tumors such as hamartomas (the most common benign lung tumor,) bronchial adenomas, fibromas, blastomas, neurofibromas, and hemangiomas. can show up as a nodule in the lungs on x-ray. Malignant tumors – Cancers that may appear as a nodule includes lung cancer, lymphomas , sarcomas, and carcinoid tumors. Metastases - Lung nodules may also be due to metastases from other cancers such as breast cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer.  Other benign nodules - Pulmonary infarctions (areas of lung tissue that have lost their blood supply,) blood vessel abnormalities (AV malformations,) atelectasis (collapse of part of a lung,) pulmonary fibrosis , and amyloidosis are all other possible causes of a lung nodule. Diagnosis The first thing your doctor will want to do if she sees a lung nodule on your x-ray is to obtain any previous x-rays you have had and compare them. If the nodule or nodules have been present for a long time, further tests may not be needed. If the nodule is new or you don’t have any prior x-rays to compare, further workup may be needed. If a nodule is found on a chest x-ray, the first step will usually be to do a CT scan of your chest. Other tests such as an MRI may be needed. At this point, your doctor will want to know your history as well as any risk factors you have for any type of lung nodules (see below.) For example, if you have recently traveled, a fungal infection may be more likely whereas if you have smoked, a malignant tumor may be more likely. Characteristics of the tumor as seen on your CT scan will also be evaluated. A PET scan is sometimes helpful in further defining a nodule. Unlike CT scans and MRI are "structural" tests. They can find lesions in the lungs but don't really give a measure of what is happening in a nodule. With a PET scan, a small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into your blood stream. Actively growing tumors take up more of the sugar which lights up on the exam. This can be helpful in distinguishing a growing tumor from a scar tissue as a growing tumor will take up more of the sugar. This is especially helpful for those who have had previous chest radiation, lung infections or surgery which may result in scar tissue. If a nodule does not appear to be growing or has characteristics of a benign tumor, (has "low probability" of being cancer) a "wait and watch" approach may sometimes be taken with a CT scan repeated after a certain period of time. Single solitary nodules that have remained unchanged for a period of two or more years do not generally need any further workup. Biopsy of Pulmonary Nodules Unfortunately, a lung biopsy is often needed to know for sure what is causing a nodule. Thankfully, newer and less invasive methods of sampling tissue are now often available. This may be important even if your doctor is fairly sure what is causing the nodule or nodules. An example is when nodules are thought to be metastatic cancer from another tumor such as breast cancer. Recent research suggests that even when a lung nodule is found in a person who might be expected to have lung metastases, only half of the nodules were metastases when biopsied. Up to 25 percent, rather, were a second primary lung cancer. Depending on the location of the nodule, a fine needle biopsy may be done. Sometimes an endobronchial ultrasound and biopsy can be done as part of a  bronchoscopy. At times an open biopsy may be needed. Even when this is the case, newer techniques, such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) can often be done instead of a thoracotomy. Benign vs. Malignant Nodules Overall, the likelihood that a lung nodule is cancer is 40 percent, but the risk of a lung nodule being cancerous varies considerably depending on several factors. In people less than 35 years of age, the chance that a lung nodule is cancer is less than one percent, whereas half of lung nodules in people over age 50 are malignant (cancerous). Other factors that raise or lower the risk that a lung nodule is cancer include: Size - Larger nodules are more likely to be cancerous than smaller ones. Smoking - Current and former smokers are more likely to have cancerous lung nodules than never smokers. Learn the percentage of smokers who get lung cancer. Occupation - Some occupational exposures raise the likelihood that a nodule is cancer. Medical history - Having a history of cancer increases the chance that a nodule could be malignant. Family histor y - Those who have nodules and a family history of lung cancer are more likely to have cancerous nodules than those without a family history. Symptoms - The chance that a nodule is lung cancer is greater if other signs or symptoms of lung cancer are present. Shape/appearance of the nodule - Smooth, round nodules are more likely to be benign, whereas “spiculated” nodules, or with irregular or lobular borders are more likely to be cancerous. Solid/non-solid - Nodules that are part solid rather than solid are more likely to be cancerous Growth - Cancerous lung nodules tend to grow fairly rapidly with an average doubling time of about four months, while benign nodules tend to remain the same size over time. Calcification - Lung nodules that are calcified are more likely to be benign. Cavitation - Nodules described as “cavitary,” meaning that the interior part of the nodule appears darker on x-rays, are more likely to be benign. Ground glass nodules - Nodules that are described as having a ground glass appearance are often a challenge and can be either benign or malignant. Due to this difficulty, a biopsy of these lesions is usually needed. The number of nodules - Those who have multiple nodules are more likely to have cancer than those who have a solitary or only a few pulmonary nodules. Location of the nodules - Lobules located in the right or left lower lobes or the right middle lobe of the lung are less likely to be cancerous than those located in the left or right upper lobes. Ethnicity and geographic location - If you have traveled outside the United States, a lung nodule is more likely to be benign. For example, ecent studies have found that lung nodules due to schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection, are fairly common in African migrants . Likewise, nodules related to fungal infections, such as coccidiomycosis are common in the Southwest. Indeterminate Lung Nodules The number of lung nodules that are read by radiologists as "indeterminate" has increased with the advent of lung cancer screening. Hearing that your nodule or nodules are indeterminate can be confusing. Isn't it obvious? Unfortunately, there are times when it is impossible on imaging tests alone to know whether a nodule is malignant—even after considering all of the factors above. In order to answer this question, a biopsy must be done. Thankfully, radiologists, surgeons, and pathologists together are finding less invasive methods of sampling tissue. To understand better why this question is so difficult, you may wish to learn more about the differences between benign and malignant tumors . Lung Cancer Screening Lung cancer screening in appropriate people has been found to decrease the mortality rate from lung cancer by 20 percent. But as with any screening test, there is the risk of false positives, and it's common to find nodules on CT screening. But finding nodules does not always mean cancer. In fact, studies thus far estimate that  only around five percent of nodules found on a first lung CT screening are cancerous. Treatment The treatment of lung nodules varies widely depending upon the cause, whether they are related to infections, inflammation, cancer, or other conditions. Most benign lung nodules, especially those that are present and haven’t changed over a period of a few years, can be left alone. A Word From Verywell If you've heard that you or a loved one have a lung nodule you are probably a combination of nervous and overwhelmed. There are so many different possibilities and some of these are frightening. It may help a little to consider that the majority of nodules are not cancer, and even those that are may be curable with surgery. If you decide to research your nodule in line it's important to note that the science is changing rapidly. Newer diagnostic techniques are becoming available as well as new treatments each year. Since medicine is changing so rapidly, It's important to be your own advocate in your medical care. If you aren't getting answers, ask more questions. Consider getting a second opinion regardless of what you hear. Finally, reach out to family and friends. If your nodule turns out to be lung cancer there is an active lung cancer community that will welcome you in. Sources: Gould, M., Donington, J., Lynch, W. et al.

Lung nodules — small masses of tissue in the lung — are quite common. They appear as round, white shadows on a chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan.  Lung nodules are usually about 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) to 1.2 inches (30 millimeters) in size. A larger lung nodule, such as one that's 30 millimeters or larger, is more likely to be cancerous than is a smaller lung nodule.  If your doctor detects a lung nodule on an imaging test, it's helpful to compare your current imaging scan with a previous one. If the nodule on earlier images hasn't changed in size, shape or appearance in two years, it's probably noncancerous.  Noncancerous lung nodules are often caused by previous infections. Noncancerous lung nodules usually require no treatment. In some cases your doctor may recommend annual chest imaging to see if a lung nodule grows or changes over time.  If a lung nodule is new or has changed in size, shape or appearance, your doctor may recommend further testing — such as a CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, bronchoscopy or tissue biopsy — to determine if it's cancerous.

The thyroid gland is located in the lower front of the neck, below the voicebox (larynx) and above the collarbones.  A thyroid nodule is a lump in or on the thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are detected in about 6 percent of women and 1-2 percent of men; they occur 10 times as often in older individuals, but are usually not diagnosed.  Any time a lump is discovered in thyroid tissue, the possibility of malignancy ( cancer ) must be considered. More than 95 percent of thyroid nodules are benign (noncancerous), but tests are needed to determine if a nodule is cancerous.  Benign nodules include:   Multinodular goiter, also called a nontoxic goiter. The word goiter means the thyroid gland has grown too large. This usually happens when the pituitary gland in the brain creates too much thyroid stimulating hormone. If the goiter is small, the problem may be treated with thyroid hormone pills. Surgery is needed if the goiter is large or does not stop growing after taking thyroid hormones. A large thyroid gland can press against the trachea (windpipe) or esophagus (food tube) and cause difficult breathing or eating.  Benign follicular adenomas. The word follicular means the cells look like a group of small circles under a microscope. If the follicular cells are contained within the nodule, the condition is called benign. If the cells have invaded the surrounding tissue, the diagnosis is cancer.  Thyroid cysts are nodules filled with fluid. If a nodule has both fluid and solid parts, it is called a complex nodule. They need to be surgically removed if they cause neck pain or difficultly swallowing.     What causes thyroid nodules?  Nodules can be caused by a simple overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue, fluid-filled cysts, inflammation (thyroiditis) or a tumor (either benign or cancerous). Most nodules were surgically removed until the 1980s. In retrospect, this approach led to many unnecessary operations, since fewer than 10 percent of the removed nodules proved to be cancerous. Most removed nodules could have simply been observed or treated medically.  Chronic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) is an inflammation of the thyroid gland that develops slowly. It frequently leads to a decreased function of the thyroid ( hypothyroidism ). Thyroiditis occurs when the body's immune system destroys the cells in the thyroid gland. Chronic thyroiditis is most common in women and people with a family history of thyroid disease.    What are the symptoms of thyroid nodules? Many patients with thyroid nodules have no symptoms and are found by chance to have a lump in the thyroid gland during a routine physical exam or an imaging study done for unrelated reasons. A minority of patients may become aware of a gradually enlarging lump in the front portion of the neck or may experience a vague pressure sensation or discomfort when swallowing. A lump in the neck should be brought to the attention of your physician, even in the absence of symptoms.   How are thyroid nodules diagnosed?  Fine Needle Biopsy  A thyroid fine needle biopsy is a simple procedure that can be performed in the physician's office. Some physicians numb the skin over the nodule prior to the biopsy, but it is not necessary to be put to sleep, and patients can usually return to work or home afterward with no ill effects.  This test provides information that no other test can offer short of surgery. A thyroid needle biopsy will provide sufficient information on which to base a treatment decision more than 85 percent of the time if an ultrasound is used.  Use of fine needle biopsy has drastically reduced the number of patients who have undergone unnecessary operations for benign nodules. However, about 10-20 percent of biopsy specimens are interpreted as inconclusive or inadequate, that is, the pathologist cannot be certain whether the nodule is cancerous or benign.  In such cases, a physician who is experienced with thyroid disease can use other criteria to make a decision about whether to operate.  Thyroid Scan  A thyroid scan is a picture of the thyroid gland taken after a small dose of a radioactive isotope normally concentrated by thyroid cells has been injected or swallowed. The scan tells whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning (a "hot" nodule). Because cancer is rarely found in hot nodules, a scan showing a hot nodule eliminates the need for fine needle biopsy. If a hot nodule causes hyperthyroidism, it can be treated with radioiodine or surgery.  Neither a thyroid scan nor radioiodine treatment should ever be given to a pregnant woman. Small amounts of radioactive iodine will be excreted in breast milk. Since radioiodine could permanently damage the infant's thyroid, breast-feeding is not allowed for women undergoing radioiodine treatment.  Ultrasound  In thyroid ultrasoundography, high-frequency sound waves pass through the skin and are reflected back to the machine to create detailed images of the thyroid. It can visualize nodules as small as 2-3 millimeters. Ultrasound distinguishes thyroid cysts (fluid-filled nodules) from solid nodules. Recent advances in ultrasonography helps physicians identify nodules which are more likely to be cancerous.  Thyroid ultrasonography is also used for guidance of a fine needle for aspirating thyroid nodules. Ultrasound guidance enables physicians to biopsy the nodule to obtain an adequate amount of material for interpretation.  Even when a thyroid biopsy sample is reported as benign, the size of the nodule should be monitored. A thyroid ultrasound examination provides an objective and precise method for detection of a change in the size of the nodule. A nodule with a benign biopsy that is stable or decreasing in size is unlikely to be malignant or require surgical treatment.    How are thyroid nodules treated?  Most patients who appear to have benign nodules require no specific treatment. Some physicians prescribe the hormone levothyroxine with hopes of preventing nodule growth or reducing the size of cold nodules. Radioiodine may be used to treat hot nodules. In a patient with a known thyroid nodule, the initial step is to determine the risk for cancer. High-risk factors include:  Being male under age 40  A history of radiation therapy to the head or neck  Big lymph nodes in the neck  Problems swallowing  Problems speaking  A family history of thyroid cancer   If the lesion is benign, the patient is monitored via ultrasound for the growth of the nodule or development of new nodules. If there is growth, another biopsy may be performed. If the lesion is malignant, the patient is referred to one of the Thyroid Cancer Program surgeons for removal of the thyroid.  About 10 percent of the time, the pathologist is unable to provide a diagnosis due to lack of specimen from the aspiration. That suggests an increased risk for malignancy, which may require surgery or monitoring.  In most surgeries, the entire thyroid is removed (total thyroidectomy). Lymph nodes also may be removed to determine if the tumor has spread beyond the thyroid gland . Subsequent therapy depends upon the findings at the time of surgery. Some patients may be placed on thyroid hormone and followed with blood tests and ultrasound examinations, while other will receive radioactive iodine to destroy the residual thyroid tissue and then be followed with blood tests and ultrasounds.  Using this type of therapy, the majority of cancers will be either cured or controlled and less than 20 percent will recur. In the case of aggressive disease, a patient may qualify for clinical trials with newer therapies such as targeted chemotherapies.    Key points   A thyroid nodule is a lump in or on the thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are detected in about 6 percent of women and 1-2 percent of men; they occur 10 times as often in older individuals, but are usually not diagnosed.  Any time a lump is discovered in thyroid tissue, the possibility of cancer must be considered.  More than 95 percent of thyroid nodules are benign.     Next steps  Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:   Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen.  Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.  Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.  At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you.  Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are.  Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways.  Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.  Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.  If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.  Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.     Not what you're looking for?

What do physicians mean when they say “lung mass,” what are possible causes, what are the chances its lung cancer, and what tests might be recommended to determine the cause? Definition A "lung mass" is defined as an abnormal spot or area in the lungs that is more than 3 cm (1 ½ inches) in size. If a spot (or spots) is less than 3 cm in diameter, it is instead called a " lung nodule ." The most common causes of a lung mass differ from that of a lung nodule, as well as the chance that the abnormality may be cancer.         Causes As noted above, the term lung nodule is used to describe smaller abnormal areas in the lungs than a lung mass. Overall, the chance that a lung nodule is benign is greater than the chance that it is malignant (cancerous), Unfortunately, the most common cause of a mass in the lungs is one of the types of lung cancer . Before you get too upset in reading this, however, there are benign causes of a lung mass. And even if it is lung cancer, both the treatments for and the survival have improved in recent years. As you read on, keep this in mind, especially if you have known someone who had lung cancer more than a year or two ago. In some cases, advanced lung cancer (stage 4 lung cancer) can almost be treated as a chronic disease. And immunotherapy drugs (the first approved in 2015 and now 4 available) can sometimes lead to a "durable response" (oncology lingo for perhaps even a cure) for people with even the most advanced stages of the disease.   Lung cancer is far too common and is currently the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women in the United States. Lung cancer may occur even in people who have never smoked, and in fact, the majority (around 80 percent) of people who develop lung cancer at this time do not smoke; they are either former smokers or never smoked.         At least 20 percent of women who develop lung cancer have never smoked a single cigarette. Unlike the reduction of lung cancer in older men, for one group of people, lung cancer has been increasing significantly: young, never-smoking women. That said, there are benign (non-cancerous) causes of lung masses. Some causes of a lung mass include: Lung cancer. Other cancers. Some cancers that may appear as a mass in the lungs include lymphomas and sarcomas. Benign (non-cancerous) lung tumors, such as hamartomas , the most common type of benign lung tumor. Metastases (spread) of cancers from other regions of the body to the lung. The most common cancers which spread to the lungs and can cause a lung mass or masses include breast cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer. Lung abscesses. Abscesses are infections which have been "walled off" and contained by the body. AV malformations. An AV malformation is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins that are usually present from birth. Lipoid pneumonia. Infections. Fungal infections such as coccidiomycosis and blastomycosis and parasitic infections such as echinococcus (hydatid cysts) can cause a lung mass. Pulmonary artery aneurysms. An outpouching in the arteries that travel from the heart to the lungs can appear as a mass on imaging tests.         Amyloidosis . Amyloidosis is a build up of abnormal proteins that form a mass. Link to Cancer Sadly, the most likely diagnosis, if you have a lung mass, is lung cancer. Yet there are many non-cancerous causes, as noted above. A lung mass is more likely to be cancerous if it is described as “ ground glass ” on an imaging report, whereas the finding of “ calcifications ” is more common in benign tumors. If a tumor is described as “ cavitary ” it is also more likely to be benign. A history of smoking, or working in occupations with exposures to cancer-causing substances raises the chances that a tumor is cancer.  Questions Your Doctor Might Ask The first thing your doctor will want to do is perform a careful history and physical. Some of the questions she might ask include: Have you ever smoked? Have you traveled recently? What other medical conditions do you have? Do you have a family history of any medical problems including lung cancer and other lung conditions? Have you been exposed to elevated radon levels in your home? ( Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer.) Are you having any symptoms such as a persistent cough , coughing up blood , shortness of breath , pain in the area of your lung , shoulder , or back , or have you had unexplained weight loss ? Diagnosis Depending on the results of a careful history and physical exam, further tests might include: A CT scan. If your doctor noted a lung mass on a chest x-ray , one of the first things she may recommend is a CT scan to look at the mass more closely. This can help define the size and location of the mass, and sometimes make sure that the mass wasn’t an “artifact” on the x-ray— that is, something that looked like a mass but wasn’t, such as an overlap of tissues. MRI studies. A PET Scan . A PET scan is an imaging study that looks for active growth in an area that is suspicious. For example, a suspicious area that does not light up on a PET scan may be old scar tissue whereas an area that lights up (shows sign of active growth) is more likely to be a cancerous tumor. Tests like this can be especially helpful if a person has had radiation treatment for breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, or lung cancer in the past, as radiation may cause scar tissue that looks a lot like a tumor on imaging. A Bronchoscopy . If the mass is in the central area of the lungs near the large airways, a bronchoscopy may be recommended. During a bronchoscopy, doctors pass a flexible tube through your mouth and down into your bronchi. This test can look for abnormalities in and near the large airways, and a biopsy can be performed if needed. An endobronchial ultrasound may also be done (an ultrasound that is done through the bronchi) during a bronchoscopy to better view abnormalities deeper in the lungs but relatively close to the airways. A fine needle biopsy . If your lung mass is in the outer regions of the lungs, your doctor may recommend a biopsy with a needle that is placed through the chest wall and into the mass to get a tissue sample. Lung surgery . Sometimes it may be difficult to get a sample of the cells in your lung mass with either a needle biopsy or via a bronchoscopy. If this is the case, thoracic surgery may be recommended to get a sample of tissue . This may be done through small incisions and using instruments with a camera (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery), or through a traditional incision to access the lungs (thoractomy). Treatment The treatment of your lung mass will depend on the underlying cause. If it is a cancerous tumor of the lung or from the spread of cancer from another region of the body to the lung, treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Other less common causes of lung masses, such as infections, will be treated based on the diagnosis you and your doctor determine after testing. Benign vs. Malignant Masses It can be very confusing when you are first diagnosed with a lung nodule or lung mass. Why isn't it easier to tell if something is cancerous or not? Why are the treatments so different? It can be helpful to learn the difference between a malignant and benign tumor . A Word From Verywell If your doctor is pretty sure that your lung mass is cancer, you may be feeling scared. What does this mean? What happens next? If that describes you, take a moment to learn about the first steps to take when you are diagnosed with lung cancer . Remember that treatments are improving. Be your own advocate and learn as much as you can about your disease. There is also a wonderful lung cancer community available online with people who can provide support (the kind that only someone else living with the disease can) while helping you better understand your cancer and your options.

Newsletter What causes a spot on the lung? Medically reviewed by Monica Bien, PA-C on  November 22, 2016 — Written by Valencia Higuera Causes Next steps Outlook Spot on the lungs   A spot on the lungs usually refers to a pulmonary nodule. This is a small, round growth on the lungs that shows up as a white spot on image scans. Typically, these nodules are smaller than three 3 centimeters (cm) in diameter.  If your doctor sees a pulmonary nodule on a chest X-ray or CT scan , don’t panic. Pulmonary nodules are common and most are benign or noncancerous. Nodules are found on up to half of all lung CT scans. When a pulmonary nodule is cancerous, the spot or growth is usually larger than 3 cm or has other characteristics like an irregular shape.  Pulmonary nodules don’t cause symptoms. You may have a nodule on your lungs for years and never know it. If a spot on your lungs is cancerous, you may have symptoms related to the specific type of cancer. For example, growths caused by lung cancer may cause a persistent cough or breathing difficulties.  Causes Causes of pulmonary
nodules  Noncancerous pulmonary nodules can develop from conditions that cause inflammation or scar tissue on the lungs. Possible causes include:  lung infections, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis granuloma, which are small clumps of cells that grow because of inflammation noninfectious diseases that cause noncancerous nodules, such as sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis neoplasms, which are abnormal growths that can be benign or cancerous cancerous tumors, such as lung cancer , lymphoma , sarcoma metastatic tumors that spread from other parts of the body  Less than 5 percent of pulmonary nodules are malignant, or cancerous. The risk for cancer increases when:  a nodule is large the nodule appears to have lobes or a pointed surface you are a current or former smoker  you have a family history of lung cancer you've been exposed to asbestos you have a history of chronic obstructive lung disease you are over age 60  Next steps Next steps after finding
a spot on the lungs  A pulmonary nodule may be first detected on a chest X-ray. After that, you may need further testing to better characterize the nodule to help determine if it is benign or cancerous.  Your doctor may request information about your medical history and your history of smoking. Additionally, your doctor needs to know if you’ve been exposed to secondhand smoke or environmental chemicals.  The first step of the process is examining the size and shape of the nodule. The bigger the nodule, and the more irregular the shape, the greater the risk of it being cancerous.  A CT scan can provide a clear image of the nodule and give more information about the shape, size, and location. If the results from a CT scan reveal that a nodule is small and smooth, your doctor may monitor the nodule over time to see if it changes in size or shape. You’ll have to repeat the CT scan a few times at regular intervals. If the nodule doesn't grow larger or change over a two-year period, it's unlikely to be cancer.  In addition to a CT scan, your doctor may complete a tuberculin skin test to check for tuberculosis or draw your blood to rule out other causes.  If your doctor believes a pulmonary nodule is cancerous, they may order more tests. Diagnostic testing used to confirm or rule out cancer includes:  Positron emission tomography (PET scan):  These tests use radioactive glucose molecules to determine if the cells that make up the nodule, are dividing rapidly.  Biopsy: Your doctor may order a biopsy , especially if the results of the PET scan are inconclusive. During this procedure, a tissue sample is removed from the nodule. It’s then examined for cancer cells using a microscope.  Sometimes this is done by a needle biopsy which is inserted near the edge of your lung through the chest wall. Another option is a bronchoscopy where your doctor inserts a scope through the mouth or nose and passes it through your large airways to collect cells.  If a pulmonary nodule is cancerous, your doctor will determine the best course of treatment based on the stage and type of the cancer. Treatment options can include radiation or chemotherapy to kill and prevent the spread of cancer cells, or surgery to remove the tumor.  Outlook Outlook for pulmonary
nodules  In most cases, your doctor can safely say that the nodule isn’t cancer if it doesn’t increase in size and remains small over a period of two years. At that point, there is no need for further testing.  If the nodule is cancerous and there is only one, it is likely still in the early stages when treatment offers the best chance of cure.  In some cases, a cancerous pulmonary nodule represents a metastasis from a cancer that began in another part of the body. If that is the case treatment will depend on the original cancer.  Other causes of lung nodules are infections, inflammatory conditions, and benign tumors or cysts . If you have any of these underlying conditions your doctor may recommend treatment that will depend on the underlying condition.   READ THIS NEXT What Are the Effects of Psoriasis on the Lungs?

What are some causes? How often do people have lung nodules? And what are the chances that it's lung cancer ? It's important to state right away that the majority —at least 60 percent of lung nodules overall—are not cancerous. We will talk about these possible causes, but it's equally important to note that if a nodule is lung cancer there is still a good chance that it can be cured.         A nodule, by definition, is less than three centimeters in diameter, and at this size, many lung cancers are very curable. Yet even for lung cancers that are larger, the treatment and survival rates for lung cancer have improved significantly in just the past few years. A final point before beginning is to note that following through on getting a diagnosis is important even if you've never smoked. At the current time, there are more former smokers and never smokers who develop lung cancer , than people who smoke. What Are Lung Nodules? A lung nodule is defined as a “spot” on the lung that is three centimeters (about 1.5 inches) in diameter or less. These nodules are often referred to as "coin lesions" when described on an imaging test. If an abnormality is seen on an x-ray of the lungs is larger than three centimeters, it is considered a “ lung mass ” instead of a nodule and is more likely to be cancerous.   Lung nodules usually need to be at least one centimeter in size before they can be seen on a chest x-ray, whereas nodules as small as one to two millimeters may sometimes be seen on a CT scan. Prevalence Lung nodules are quite common and are found on one in 500 chest x-rays, and one in 100 CT scans of the chest.         Approximately 150,000 lung nodules are detected in people in the United States each year. Roughly half of people over the age of 50 who smoke will have nodules on a CT scan of their chest. If a potential nodule is seen on a chest x-ray, it is important to have a CT scan. Small cancers can be missed on a chest x-ray . Symptoms Most lung nodules do not cause any symptoms and are found “accidentally” or "incidentally" when a chest x-ray is done for some other reason. If symptoms are present, they may include a cough, coughing up blood, wheezing, shortness of breath, or respiratory infections if the nodule(s) is located near a major airway. Causes Lung nodules can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancer). The most common causes overall include granulomas (clumps of inflamed tissue due to an infection or inflammation) and hamartomas (benign lung tumors). The most common cause of malignant lung nodules includes lung cancer or cancers from other regions of the body that have spread to the lungs ( metastatic cancer ). Nodules can be broken down into a few major categories. Infections - Infectious causes of nodules may include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, and coccidiomycosis, and parasitic infections such as ascariasis (roundworms,) echinococcus (hydatid cysts) and paragonimous (liver flukes.) When the immune system "walls off" areas of infection it often forms granulomas.         Inflammation - Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , sarcoidosis , and Wegener's granulomatosis, as well as pneumoconioses such as silicosis can also lead to granulomas. Benign tumors - Benign lung tumors such as hamartomas (the most common benign lung tumor,) bronchial adenomas, fibromas, blastomas, neurofibromas, and hemangiomas. can show up as a nodule in the lungs on x-ray. Malignant tumors – Cancers that may appear as a nodule includes lung cancer, lymphomas , sarcomas, and carcinoid tumors. Metastases - Lung nodules may also be due to metastases from other cancers such as breast cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer.  Other benign nodules - Pulmonary infarctions (areas of lung tissue that have lost their blood supply,) blood vessel abnormalities (AV malformations,) atelectasis (collapse of part of a lung,) pulmonary fibrosis , and amyloidosis are all other possible causes of a lung nodule. Diagnosis The first thing your doctor will want to do if she sees a lung nodule on your x-ray is to obtain any previous x-rays you have had and compare them. If the nodule or nodules have been present for a long time, further tests may not be needed. If the nodule is new or you don’t have any prior x-rays to compare, further workup may be needed. If a nodule is found on a chest x-ray, the first step will usually be to do a CT scan of your chest. Other tests such as an MRI may be needed. At this point, your doctor will want to know your history as well as any risk factors you have for any type of lung nodules (see below.) For example, if you have recently traveled, a fungal infection may be more likely whereas if you have smoked, a malignant tumor may be more likely. Characteristics of the tumor as seen on your CT scan will also be evaluated. A PET scan is sometimes helpful in further defining a nodule. Unlike CT scans and MRI are "structural" tests. They can find lesions in the lungs but don't really give a measure of what is happening in a nodule. With a PET scan, a small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into your blood stream. Actively growing tumors take up more of the sugar which lights up on the exam. This can be helpful in distinguishing a growing tumor from a scar tissue as a growing tumor will take up more of the sugar. This is especially helpful for those who have had previous chest radiation, lung infections or surgery which may result in scar tissue. If a nodule does not appear to be growing or has characteristics of a benign tumor, (has "low probability" of being cancer) a "wait and watch" approach may sometimes be taken with a CT scan repeated after a certain period of time. Single solitary nodules that have remained unchanged for a period of two or more years do not generally need any further workup. Biopsy of Pulmonary Nodules Unfortunately, a lung biopsy is often needed to know for sure what is causing a nodule. Thankfully, newer and less invasive methods of sampling tissue are now often available. This may be important even if your doctor is fairly sure what is causing the nodule or nodules. An example is when nodules are thought to be metastatic cancer from another tumor such as breast cancer. Recent research suggests that even when a lung nodule is found in a person who might be expected to have lung metastases, only half of the nodules were metastases when biopsied. Up to 25 percent, rather, were a second primary lung cancer. Depending on the location of the nodule, a fine needle biopsy may be done. Sometimes an endobronchial ultrasound and biopsy can be done as part of a  bronchoscopy. At times an open biopsy may be needed. Even when this is the case, newer techniques, such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) can often be done instead of a thoracotomy. Benign vs. Malignant Nodules Overall, the likelihood that a lung nodule is cancer is 40 percent, but the risk of a lung nodule being cancerous varies considerably depending on several factors. In people less than 35 years of age, the chance that a lung nodule is cancer is less than one percent, whereas half of lung nodules in people over age 50 are malignant (cancerous). Other factors that raise or lower the risk that a lung nodule is cancer include: Size - Larger nodules are more likely to be cancerous than smaller ones. Smoking - Current and former smokers are more likely to have cancerous lung nodules than never smokers. Learn the percentage of smokers who get lung cancer. Occupation - Some occupational exposures raise the likelihood that a nodule is cancer. Medical history - Having a history of cancer increases the chance that a nodule could be malignant. Family histor y - Those who have nodules and a family history of lung cancer are more likely to have cancerous nodules than those without a family history. Symptoms - The chance that a nodule is lung cancer is greater if other signs or symptoms of lung cancer are present. Shape/appearance of the nodule - Smooth, round nodules are more likely to be benign, whereas “spiculated” nodules, or with irregular or lobular borders are more likely to be cancerous. Solid/non-solid - Nodules that are part solid rather than solid are more likely to be cancerous Growth - Cancerous lung nodules tend to grow fairly rapidly with an average doubling time of about four months, while benign nodules tend to remain the same size over time. Calcification - Lung nodules that are calcified are more likely to be benign. Cavitation - Nodules described as “cavitary,” meaning that the interior part of the nodule appears darker on x-rays, are more likely to be benign. Ground glass nodules - Nodules that are described as having a ground glass appearance are often a challenge and can be either benign or malignant. Due to this difficulty, a biopsy of these lesions is usually needed. The number of nodules - Those who have multiple nodules are more likely to have cancer than those who have a solitary or only a few pulmonary nodules. Location of the nodules - Lobules located in the right or left lower lobes or the right middle lobe of the lung are less likely to be cancerous than those located in the left or right upper lobes. Ethnicity and geographic location - If you have traveled outside the United States, a lung nodule is more likely to be benign. For example, ecent studies have found that lung nodules due to schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection, are fairly common in African migrants . Likewise, nodules related to fungal infections, such as coccidiomycosis are common in the Southwest. Indeterminate Lung Nodules The number of lung nodules that are read by radiologists as "indeterminate" has increased with the advent of lung cancer screening. Hearing that your nodule or nodules are indeterminate can be confusing. Isn't it obvious? Unfortunately, there are times when it is impossible on imaging tests alone to know whether a nodule is malignant—even after considering all of the factors above. In order to answer this question, a biopsy must be done. Thankfully, radiologists, surgeons, and pathologists together are finding less invasive methods of sampling tissue. To understand better why this question is so difficult, you may wish to learn more about the differences between benign and malignant tumors . Lung Cancer Screening Lung cancer screening in appropriate people has been found to decrease the mortality rate from lung cancer by 20 percent. But as with any screening test, there is the risk of false positives, and it's common to find nodules on CT screening. But finding nodules does not always mean cancer. In fact, studies thus far estimate that  only around five percent of nodules found on a first lung CT screening are cancerous. Treatment The treatment of lung nodules varies widely depending upon the cause, whether they are related to infections, inflammation, cancer, or other conditions. Most benign lung nodules, especially those that are present and haven’t changed over a period of a few years, can be left alone. A Word From Verywell If you've heard that you or a loved one have a lung nodule you are probably a combination of nervous and overwhelmed. There are so many different possibilities and some of these are frightening. It may help a little to consider that the majority of nodules are not cancer, and even those that are may be curable with surgery. If you decide to research your nodule in line it's important to note that the science is changing rapidly. Newer diagnostic techniques are becoming available as well as new treatments each year. Since medicine is changing so rapidly, It's important to be your own advocate in your medical care. If you aren't getting answers, ask more questions. Consider getting a second opinion regardless of what you hear. Finally, reach out to family and friends. If your nodule turns out to be lung cancer there is an active lung cancer community that will welcome you in. Sources: Gould, M., Donington, J., Lynch, W. et al.

The advent of lung cancer screening has the potential to save many lives. But as with a lot of tests, there are often “false positives” something suspicious is found that later on turns out to be nothing. What are the chances that a nodule found on screening is cancer ( malignant ) and how often are nodules instead benign (non-cancerous?)         First, it’s important to talk about what’s meant by lung cancer screening, as well as a few statistics. Lung Cancer Screening and Statistics For a long time, we have hoped for a screening test for lung cancer. After all, we have mammograms to look for breast cancer, pap smears to look for cervical cancer, and colonoscopies to look for colon cancer. The reason is simple. Often (but not always) cancers are most treatable in the early stages of the disease. That’s certainly true for lung cancer. The survival rate for people with stage 1 lung cancer is roughly 60 to 80 percent. This drops to less than 10 percent for those who are diagnosed with stage 4 of the disease. Unfortunately, a good 40 percent of people already have stage 4 (metastatic) lung cancer at the time of diagnosis. Stage 4 meaning that a cancer has spread to distant regions or the other lung, and is therefore, inoperable . Considering that lung cancer is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States that's a big problem.   How Effective Are CT Scans? But for some people, we now have a screening test. The U.S. National Lung Screening Trial found that screening CT scans (low-dose CT) lowered the death rate from lung cancer by 20 percent when certain individuals have yearly screening low-dose CT scans . This includes people who:         Are between the ages of 55 and 74 Have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking, and Continue to smoke, or have quit in the past 15 years. When counting up numbers, only about 6 percent of people meet the screening guidelines, but it's a start. And with that start comes a few problems. When a nodule is seen on screening — and that's pretty common — what's the chance that it's cancer? First, it helps to understand how common it is to find nodules on lung CT screening tests. Finding an abnormality on an x-ray or CT of the chest doesn’t necessarily mean cancer. In fact, it’s more likely to be something else — something that you would never know about and would never bother you if you hadn't had the scan. How Common Are Lung Nodules in People Screened for Lung Cancer? Since CT screening is relatively new, we haven't known exactly how common nodules are. An estimate found that at least 20 percent of people (individuals who were screened based on the guidelines above) had at least one nodule that required further testing. Here it's important to make a distinction between what a radiologist may call a mass and what she refers to as a nodule. A mass refers to an abnormality greater than 3 cm (about 1 1/2 inches) in diameter.          The term nodule is used to describe abnormalities less than 3 cm in size. How Often Are Lung Pulmonary Nodules Found on Screening Cancerous? So if you get that dreaded call, the one in which your doctor says " we found a nodule on your screening CT ," how worried should you be? In the National Lung Cancer Screening trial, between 1 and 4 percent of people required invasive testing to follow-up their CT scans. Among those who had surgery, 25 percent of the nodules turned out to be benign. Looking at this a different way, In a more recent evaluation researchers looked at people in 2 separate studies.  In one of these (the Pan-American Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan,) 7008 nodules were found among 1871 people. Of these 102 were cancerous. In the other (a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) study,) 5001 nodules were found in 1090 people, with 42 being malignant. Crunching the numbers, this comes down to 5.5 percent of the people in one study and 3.7 percent in the other who had nodules that turned out to be cancerous. At this point, it’s important to note that these numbers — the likelihood that a nodule is cancerous —  are for healthy people without symptoms who are being screened. The likelihood of a nodule being malignant may be different for those who have symptoms. It may also be different for those who have a pulmonary nodule on screening but do not meet the criteria noted above. When is a Nodule More Likely to Be Cancer? Looking at studies to date, pulmonary nodules found on CT screening were more likely to be cancerous if: They were in the left or right upper lobes, and less likely to be malignant if they were in the right or left lower lobes, or in the right middle lobe. There was speculation of the nodule (meaning that instead of the abnormal area being round, it had spike like areas sticking out from the tumor,) or if the borders were irregular or lobulated. If they were larger. If they occurred in older people more than in younger people. If an individual had a family history of lung cancer. If they occurred in women more often than men. With increasing size of the nodule. In people with a history of emphysema. In people with fewer nodules. In addition: Part solid nodules were more likely to be cancerous than solid nodules. Solid nodules were more likely to be cancerous than non-solid nodules or nodules with a "ground glass" appearance. What Is My Nodule If It Isn’t Cancer? There are many causes of nodules ranging from infections to tuberculosis , to nodules associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and more. The following article discusses several benign and malignant causes of pulmonary nodules . Calculating Risk A lung cancer calculator is available for physicians (and the public) to estimate the chances that a nodule found on screening CT is malignant. This Nodule Prediction Calculator was developed based on scientific research, but people are cautioned that it's not a substitute for a physician's advice or treatment. The disclaimer people are asked to read emphasizes a very important point: Not all nodules that are high risk are cancer, and not all nodules that are low risk benign. Where Do You Go From Here? If your doctor determines that you have a pulmonary nodule or nodules, there are several approaches she may recommend. These will depend on several things including your risk factors for lung cancer, the appearance of the nodule, the location of the nodule, and your personal preference. Some options may include: A PET Scan A Bronchoscopy Watchful waiting A biopsy (There are several ways that a nodule may be biopsied depending upon its location.) Sources: Croswell, J. et al.

In the United States, lung cancer is the most fatal cancer in women, having passed breast cancer in 1987 as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. It is also the most fatal cancer in men , killing more men than prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer combined. Overall, 27 percent of cancer deaths in the U.S. are due to lung cancer.         An overview of the stages of lung cancer. Before anyone dismisses these numbers as due to smoking alone, it's important to point out that even if smoking were banned today, we would still have lung cancer. Lung cancer in never-smokers is the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In fact, the focus on smoking cessation as a way to treat lung cancer has, in some ways, overshadowed research looking into other causes.          List  These Are the 10 Most Fatal Cancers for Men           Article  What Are the Major Types of Lung Cancer?       What Is Lung Cancer? Lung cancer originates in the tissues of the lungs or the cells lining the airways (the bronchi). These cells begin as and look like lung cancer cells under the microscope, with the exception of changes that occur in the process of becoming cancerous. If lung cancer spreads to other regions of the body, the cells are still lung cancer cells. For example, if lung cancer spreads to the brain, cells taken from the metastasis (growth) in the brain would be identifiable as cancerous lung cancer cells under the microscope. In contrast, some tumors begin in other parts of the body and spread (metastasize) to the lungs.         This is referred to as metastatic cancer to the lungs and not lung cancer. An example would be a breast cancer which spreads to the lungs. This would not be called lung cancer, but rather "breast cancer metastatic to the lungs." Anatomy of Lung Cancer Lung cancer may occur anywhere in the lungs. The right lung is made up of three lobes and the left lung, two lobes. When we take a breath of air, it enters through our nose and mouth, passes down through the trachea (the windpipe) and then into the mainstem bronchus. It then travels via a bronchus to either the right or the left lung. Once in the bronchi, the air then travels through increasingly smaller bronchioles and on into the alveoli —tiny air sacs in the lungs through which the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen takes place. Capillaries (the smallest of blood vessels) surround the alveoli, receiving the oxygen to carry it to the rest of the body. Cancer may occur anywhere in the respiratory system from the large bronchi down to the alveoli.          List  Causes and Rates of Lung Cancer From Different Countries           Article  What Is the Meaning of a Cancer Latency Period?       Where Is Lung Cancer Most Common? Unfortunately, lung cancer is common throughout the world. Overall, the countries with the most lung cancer worldwide include Hungary, Serbia, and Korea. Looking at lung cancer in women, however, the highest incidence is found in Denmark, followed closely by Canada and then the United States. Who Gets Lung Cancer? The average age for lung cancer is 70, and 80 percent of people who develop lung cancer have smoked, but: Lung cancer occurs in women - Women are actually much more likely to die from lung cancer than breast cancer, and the incidence of lung cancer in women has almost caught up with that in men. In 2016 it's estimated that 85,920 men and 72,160 women will die from lung cancer. In comparison, 40,450 women will die from breast cancer. Lung cancer occurs in non-smokers - And while lung cancer in men who have smoked is decreasing, lung cancer in non-smokers is increasing. It's estimated that 20 percent of women who develop lung cancer in the U.S. have never smoked, and that number increases to 50 percent worldwide.         Lung cancer occurs in young adults - It's estimated that 13.4 percent of lung cancers occur in adults under the age of 40. While this number may seem small, when compared to the incidence of lung cancer overall, it is not. Calculating this out, around 21,000 young adults will die from lung cancer this year (again comparing this to 40,450 breast cancer deaths for women of all ages.) In addition, women are more likely than men to develop lung cancer at a young age, and lung cancer in young adults is increasing. Types of Lung Cancer There are two primary types of lung cancer: Non-small cell lung cancer is most common, being responsible for 80 to 85 percent of cancers. This is the type of lung cancer more commonly found in non-smokers, women, and young adults. Small cell lung cancer is responsible for around 15 percent of lung cancers. These lung cancers tend to be aggressive and may not be found until they have already spread (especially to the brain). They usually respond fairly well to chemotherapy but have a poor prognosis.          Article  What's the Survival Rate for Each Stage of Lung Cancer?           Article  Cancer Cells vs. Normal Cells: How Are They Different?       Non-small cell lung cancer is further broken down into three types: Lung adenocarcinoma - Lung adenocarcinoma is responsible for half of non-small cell lung cancers and is currently the most common type of lung cancer. It is also the most common type of lung cancer found in women, young adults, and in people who do not smoke. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs - Squamous cell lung cancer was once the most common type of lung cancer, but its incidence has decreased in recent years. Part of the thought is that the addition of filters to cigarettes created this shift. Squamous cell cancers tend to occur in or near the large airways - the first place exposed to smoke from a cigarette. Lung adenocarcinomas, in contrast, are usually found deeper in the lungs, where smoke from a filtered cigarette would settle. Large cell lung cancer - Large cell carcinomas of the lungs tend to grow in the outer regions of the lungs. These are usually rapidly growing tumors that spread quickly. Other, less common types of lung cancer include carcinoid tumors and neuroendocrine tumors. Signs and Symptoms of Lung Cancer Having an awareness of the early signs and symptoms of lung cancer is a must for everyone for two reasons: There is not a screening test available for everyone, so the only way that most people have to find these cancers early—when they are most treatable—is knowing the signs. Recent research tells us that the majority of people in the United States are not familiar with these symptoms. Because lung cancer is common. As noted earlier, lung cancer is the leading cause of death in both men and women and anyone who has lungs is at risk. Overall, the most common symptoms include: shortness of breath with activity a persistent cough coughing up blood unexplained weight loss chest pain Of note is that the types of lung cancer have been changing over the years, and with that, the most common symptoms. In the past, lung cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer were most common. These cancers tend to grow near the large airways of the lungs and cause symptoms early on—commonly a cough and coughing up blood. Now, lung adenocarcinoma, a tumor which tends to grow in the outer regions of the lungs is most common. These cancers tend to grow for a long time before causing symptoms, which may include mild shortness of breath, subtle weight loss, and a general sense of being unwell. Diagnosis and Staging A combination of imaging studies, including CT, MRI, and PET scans may be used to diagnose lung cancer. In addition, a lung biopsy is usually needed to determine the type of lung cancer. Careful staging—figuring out how extensive a lung cancer is—is important in designing a treatment regimen. Non-small cell lung cancer is broken down into five stages: stage 0 to stage IV. Small cell lung cancer is broken down into only two stages: limited stage and extensive stage. Causes of Lung Cancer Certainly, smoking is an important cause of lung cancer, but noting the statistics above, there are other important causes of lung cancer as well. Radon exposure in the home is the second leading cause of lung cancer and the most common cause in non-smokers. Any home in the United States (or anywhere in the world for that matter) is potentially at risk, and the only way to know is to do radon testing. Radon is an odorless, colorless gas that results from the normal decay of uranium in the soil beneath our homes. It's estimated that 27,000 radon-induced lung cancer deaths occur yearly in the U.S. alone and that 15 percent of cancers worldwide are related to radon exposure. Another 7,000 lung cancer deaths occur each year due to secondhand smoke. Other causes and possible causes include occupational exposures, air pollution, wood smoke, and cooking with poor ventilation. Recently it's been found that human papillomavirus (HPV)—the virus which causes cervical cancer—is associated with some lung cancers, though it's not at all certain if this may be a factor in the cause. How Does Lung Cancer Begin? Lung cancer usually begins several years before it causes symptoms and is diagnosed. Cells in the lungs may become cancer cells after going through a series of mutations which transform them into cancer cells. Gene mutations—or changes in the DNA of the cells—may be inherited (as a hereditary predisposition ) or acquired (damaged as the result of exposure to carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) in the environment. This accumulation of mutations is one of the reasons for a common finding with lung cancer: Many people develop lung cancer though they have never smoked, and some people smoke their whole life and never develop lung cancer. Lung cancer begins—a tumor originates—when a mass of cancer cells becomes immortal in a way; cells dividing and multiplying out of control. Our normal cells are regulated by a series of checks and balances. How Does Lung Cancer Grow and Spread One of the differences between benign lung tumors and lung cancer, as noted, is that lung cancer cells have the ability to break off and spread to other regions of the body. This spread, in fact, is the cause of most cancer deaths. One of the differences between cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells lack "stickiness." Normal cells produce substances that cause them to stay together. Without this stickiness, lung cancer cells can travel and grow in other regions, as well as invade nearby structures. There are four primary ways in which lung cancers spread . It can "invade" tissues locally. Unlike benign tumors which may push up against nearby tissues, cancers actually penetrate nearby tissues. This is the reason for the name "cancer," which is derived from the word crab; cancer can send crablike extensions into nearby tissues. Lung cancer cells can also break away and spread through either the bloodstream or the lymphatic system to distant sites. In recent years, it's also been found that lung cancer may travel and spread through the airways in the lungs. Does Lung Cancer Ever Just Go Away? Though it is very rare, lung cancer does, in some cases, just go away. This phenomenon is referred to as spontaneous remission of cancer. Researchers are tapping into this discovery to learn how our immune systems ordinarily function to remove cancer cells, and design treatments based on this principle. Lung Cancer Screening Until recently, we did not have a screening test for lung cancer, but that has changed. It's important to note that chest x-rays are not an adequate screening test as these fail to pick up lung cancers at a stage early enough to improve survival. Lung cancer CT screening is now recommended for people who: are between the ages of 55 and 80 smoked for at least 30 pack-years (a pack year is calculated by multiplying the number of packages of cigarettes smoked daily times the number of years smoked) continue to smoke or quit in the past 15 years For people with other risk factors, such as a family history of lung cancer, a history of COPD, or other risk factors for lung cancer, screening may also be considered. It's estimated that if everyone who qualified for screening underwent these tests, the mortality rate from lung cancer could be decreased by 20 percent. Where Does Lung Cancer Spread? The most common sites of lung cancer metastases include the brain, the bones, the liver, and the adrenal glands. Some types of lung cancer—for example, small cell lung cancer—are often diagnosed after the cancer has already spread. Lung cancer is also somewhat unique in that it can spread to the bones of the hand and feet. Lung Cancer Treatments Treatment options for lung cancer have improved significantly in recent years. These include: Surgery - There are several types of lung cancer surgery which may be done, depending on the size and location of a tumor. Radiation therapy - Radiation therapy may be given as an adjunct to surgery, to decrease pain or airway obstruction due to a cancer, or in high doses to a localized region in an attempt to cure cancer (stereotactic body radiotherapy.) Chemotherapy - Chemotherapy usually uses a combination of medications to treat lung cancer. Targeted therapies - Everyone with lung cancer should have molecular profiling (gene testing) done on their tumors. Targeted therapy drugs are currently available for people who bear tumors with several genetic mutations including EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, and ROS1 rearrangements. Contact your oncologist for an updated list of mutations. Immunotherapy - In 2015, two immunotherapy drugs were approved for the treatment of lung cancer. In some cases, these drugs have resulted in long-term survival even for those with the advanced stages of lung cancer. A relatively new type of cancer care is termed palliative care. Palliative care is care designed to address the full spectrum of medical needs for people with cancer, including physical, emotional, and spiritual support. Unlike hospice care, palliative care can be used for anyone, even if you have a cancer which is considered curable. Early studies have found that, in addition to improving the quality of life for people, this care may also improve survival. Alternative forms of treatment such as acupuncture may help people cope with symptoms that come with cancer and cancer treatments. These integrative treatments are now available at many cancer centers. If You Have Recently Been Diagnosed With Lung Cancer If you have only recently been told you have lung cancer, you are probably very frightened and not a little overwhelmed. Learning as much as you can about your cancer can help you feel more in control of your treatment, and help you play an active role in your care. Research your cancer. Reach out to friends and family and allow them to help you with things you can delegate. Learn how to advocate for yourself as a cancer patient . You may feel isolated as you face something nobody in your group of loved ones can understand. Participating in cancer support groups and communities may allow you to connect with others who are walking a similar road. These groups are also a good way to stay updated on the latest research about lung cancer. Take a moment to pamper yourself, and forgive yourself if you are feeling out of sorts. Nobody really knows how they will feel until they are diagnosed. The emotions you experience may span the spectrum from sadness to anger, to intense anxiety—sometimes in just a matter of minutes. Check out these first steps for when you are newly diagnosed . If Your Loved One Has Lung Cancer If it is your loved one rather than yourself who has been diagnosed with lung cancer, it can sometimes be even harder to cope. On top of the diagnosis, you may feel totally helpless as to what to do. At the same time that you are struggling with fears and sadness, the emotions your loved one is experiencing can be confusing and even heartbreaking. Check out these thoughts about " when your loved one has lung cancer " in which people who have lived with the disease share what they wish their loved ones had known. A Word From Verywell The face of lung cancer is changing. For many years, people living with lung cancer have had to cope with not only the stigma of lung cancer being a "smoker's disease" but the myth that it is uniformly fatal. This stigma is changing as the public becomes more aware that anyone with lungs can get lung cancer. The survival stigma is changing as well, as the public is learning of newer and better treatments that have recently ​been approved. In addition to the many new treatments approved in the past few years alone, there are over 100 medications being studied in clinical trials for lung cancer. We still have a way to go, but many people are surviving—and thriving—while living with this disease. There is a lot of hope. Sources: American Cancer Society.

Lung cancer is often suspected after an abnormal spot is found on a chest x-ray done to evaluate a cough or chest pain. During this frightening time, it is helpful to know some of the procedures that may be recommended to find out if the abnormality is benign (non-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous).         If the abnormality is malignant, further studies are done to see if the cancer has spread ( metastasized ) to other areas in the body and to figure out the stage of the disease. Lung Cancer Screening For those without symptoms, lung cancer screening has now been approved for early detection in people who are between the ages of 55 and 80, have smoked for at least 30 pack-years, and smoke or quit smoking within the past 15 years. It's important to note, however, that screening is meant to be a test performed for those who do not have any symptoms. If you have any possible symptoms of lung cancer, further tests, including a full CT scan will be needed. Lung "Spots" and Other Descriptions Before going into the diagnosis of lung cancer, you may be feeling overwhelmed by your symptoms, and any abnormality your doctor has seen or will see on an x-ray or CT scan. As a quick review, As a quick review, a lung nodule is considered a "spot" on the lung that is 3 cm (an inch and a half) or less in diameter.   A lung mass refers to an abnormality that is larger than 3 cm in diameter. A spot on the lung or a "lung lesion" could be both benign or malignant. A "shadow" on an x-ray could also be benign or malignant, or simply the overlapping of normal structures in the chest. History and Physical When lung cancer is suspected, a physician will first perform a thorough history and physical exam.         This is done to evaluate symptoms and risk factors for lung cancer , and to look for any physical signs suggestive of lung cance r. These can include abnormal lung sounds, enlarged lymph nodes , unintentional weight loss, or clubbing of the fingernails (chubby fingernails). Laboratory and Radiology Studies A number of different imaging studies may be needed, depending on your specific symptoms and findings on exam. These may include: Chest X-Ray A chest x-ray is usually the first test performed to evaluate any concerns based on a careful history and physical.This may show a mass in the lungs or enlarged lymph nodes. Sometimes the chest x-ray is normal, and further tests are needed look for a suspected lung cancer. Even if a mass is found, these are not always cancerous and further studies are needed. It should be stressed that a chest x-ray alone is not sufficient to rule out lung cancer, and early cancers can easily be missed with these tests. CT scan A CT scan (computerized tomography) is frequently the second step either to follow up on an abnormal chest x-ray finding or to evaluate troublesome symptoms in those with a normal chest x-ray. CT scanning involves a series of x-rays that create a 3-dimensional view of the lungs.         If the CT is abnormal, the diagnosis of lung cancer still needs confirmation through a sample of tissue by one of the procedures below. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) For some people, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) will be used to evaluate the possibility of lung cancer. This procedure uses magnetism and does not involve radiation. Certain individuals, such as those with metal implants (pacemakers, etc) should not have MRI scans. The technician will ask questions to make sure these are not present. PET Scan A PET scan (positron emission tomography) uses radioactive material to create colorful 3-dimensional images of a region of the body.  This type of scan differs from the others in that it defines tumors that are actively growing. A small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into the bloodstream, and given time to be taken up by cells. Cells that are actively growing take up more sugar, and light up on films. The test is usually combined with a CT scan (PET/CT). As an addition to the other procedures, some researchers suggest that PET scanning may detect tumors earlier, even before they are visible anatomically through other studies. PET scans are also useful for distinguishing between tumors and scar tissue in people who have scarring in their lungs for any reason. Sputum Cytology After a lung cancer is suspected based on imaging, a sample of tissue is required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of cancer. Sputum cytology is the easiest way to do this, but its use is limited to those tumors that extend into the airways. Sputum cytology is not always accurate and can miss some cancer cells. The test is of most benefit when positive, but says little if it is negative. Bronchoscopy In a bronchoscopy , a lung specialist inserts a tube into the airways to visualize and take a sample of the tumor. This procedure is used when the tumor is found in the large airways and can be reached by the scope. Patients are given anesthesia during this procedure to minimize discomfort. During a bronchoscopy, a biopsy may be taken of any tumor or other abnormalities that are seen in the airways. Endobronchial Ultrasound Endobronchial ultrasound is a relatively new technique for diagnosing lung cancer. During a bronchoscopy, physicians use an ultrasound probe within the airway to examine the lungs and area between the lungs (mediastinum). For tumors that relatively close to the airways, a biopsy may be done with this imaging. Needle Biopsy In a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, a physician inserts a hollow needle through the chest wall, usually guided by CT visualization, to take a sample of the tumor. This can be performed for tumors that cannot be reached by bronchoscopy, especially those that are near the periphery of the lungs. Thoracentesis When lung cancer affects the periphery of the lungs, it can cause fluid to build up between the lungs and the lung lining (the pleura.) With local anesthesia, a larger needle is inserted into the pleural cavity from which either a diagnostic amount of fluid (small amount to test for cancer cells, a malignant pleural effusion ) or a therapeutic amount of fluid (large amount to improve pain and/or shortness of breath) is removed. Mediastinoscopy A mediastinoscopy This procedure is done in the operating room under general anesthesia. A scope is inserted just above the sternum (the breast bone) into the region between the lungs ( the mediastinum ) to take tissue samples from lymph nodes. A PET scan can now often provide the same results that a mediastinoscopy did in the past. Test to Determine if Lung Cancer Has Spread (Metastasized) Lung cancer most commonly spreads to the liver , the adrenal glands, the brain and the bones. Common tests include: CT scan of the abdomen: To check for spread to the liver or adrenal glands MRI of the brain: To look for metastases to the brain Bone scan : To test for metastases to bones , especially the back, hips, and ribs PET scan: A PET scan can look for metastases essentially anywhere in the body, and can sometimes replace other tests above such as a bone scan or CT scans. Other Tests During Diagnosis Additional non-diagnostic tests are frequently performed during the diagnosis of lung cancer as well. These can include: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): PFTs test lung capacity and can determine how much the tumor is interfering with breathing, and sometimes, whether it is safe to perform surgery Blood tests: Certain blood tests can detect biochemical abnormalities caused by lung cancers, and can also suggest spread of the tumor Lung Biopsy If a lung cancer is suspected on imaging studies, the next step is to have a lung biopsy done to determine whether or not the abnormality is truly cancer, and to determine the type of lung cancer. Most biopsies are done on tissue samples, but liquid biopsies are an exciting new way to follow some people with lung cancer.  Approved in June of 2016, these tests can be done via a simple blood draw. At the time, they are only approved for detecting EGFR mutations, but for everyone, they are a good example of how the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is improving every year. When a lung cancer spreads, it is important to "re-biopsy" tissue, as cancers can change in time, and these changes can, in turn, help you and your doctor choose the best treatment options. Molecular Profiling/Gene Testing It's now recommended that everyone with non-small cell lung cancer, and especially lung adenocarcinoma, have molecular profiling done on their tumor. This gene testing looks for mutations in cancer cells for which specific medications are available which "target" those mutations. These are not mutations that you are born with, nor can you pass them on to your children. They are mutations that occur in the process of a cell becoming cancerous and which "drive" the growth of a cancer. Targeted treatments are currently approved for people with EGFR mutations , ALK rearrangements , ROS1 rearrangements , and a few other mutations. In addition, other treatments are currently being studied in clinical trials . PD-L1 Testing Since the first immunotherapy drug was approved for the treatment of lung cancer in 2015, 3 additional medications have become available. A test referred to as PD-L1 may be done to determine the percent of expression of PD-L1 on your cancer cells. PD-L1 is a protein that is expressed in greater amounts on some lung cancer cells. This protein serves to enhance the "brakes" of the immune system, reducing its ability to fight off cancer cells. Some cancer cells have found ways to "overexpress" this protein as a method of hiding from the immune system. Medications known as checkpoint inhibitors work by blocking this action and essentially releasing the brakes on the immune system. We still don't know how important PD-L1 testing will be in the treatment of lung cancer. Both lung cancers which overexpress PD-L1 and those that don't may respond to these drugs. At the current time it's thought that it may be cost-effective to do these tests, but limiting the use of these drugs only to people who have tumors that overexpress PD-L1 could reduce the number of people who would benefit from these drugs.

The advent of lung cancer screening has the potential to save many lives. But as with a lot of tests, there are often “false positives” something suspicious is found that later on turns out to be nothing. What are the chances that a nodule found on screening is cancer ( malignant ) and how often are nodules instead benign (non-cancerous?)         First, it’s important to talk about what’s meant by lung cancer screening, as well as a few statistics. Lung Cancer Screening and Statistics For a long time, we have hoped for a screening test for lung cancer. After all, we have mammograms to look for breast cancer, pap smears to look for cervical cancer, and colonoscopies to look for colon cancer. The reason is simple. Often (but not always) cancers are most treatable in the early stages of the disease. That’s certainly true for lung cancer. The survival rate for people with stage 1 lung cancer is roughly 60 to 80 percent. This drops to less than 10 percent for those who are diagnosed with stage 4 of the disease. Unfortunately, a good 40 percent of people already have stage 4 (metastatic) lung cancer at the time of diagnosis. Stage 4 meaning that a cancer has spread to distant regions or the other lung, and is therefore, inoperable . Considering that lung cancer is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States that's a big problem.   How Effective Are CT Scans? But for some people, we now have a screening test. The U.S. National Lung Screening Trial found that screening CT scans (low-dose CT) lowered the death rate from lung cancer by 20 percent when certain individuals have yearly screening low-dose CT scans . This includes people who:         Are between the ages of 55 and 74 Have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking, and Continue to smoke, or have quit in the past 15 years. When counting up numbers, only about 6 percent of people meet the screening guidelines, but it's a start. And with that start comes a few problems. When a nodule is seen on screening — and that's pretty common — what's the chance that it's cancer? First, it helps to understand how common it is to find nodules on lung CT screening tests. Finding an abnormality on an x-ray or CT of the chest doesn’t necessarily mean cancer. In fact, it’s more likely to be something else — something that you would never know about and would never bother you if you hadn't had the scan. How Common Are Lung Nodules in People Screened for Lung Cancer? Since CT screening is relatively new, we haven't known exactly how common nodules are. An estimate found that at least 20 percent of people (individuals who were screened based on the guidelines above) had at least one nodule that required further testing. Here it's important to make a distinction between what a radiologist may call a mass and what she refers to as a nodule. A mass refers to an abnormality greater than 3 cm (about 1 1/2 inches) in diameter.          The term nodule is used to describe abnormalities less than 3 cm in size. How Often Are Lung Pulmonary Nodules Found on Screening Cancerous? So if you get that dreaded call, the one in which your doctor says " we found a nodule on your screening CT ," how worried should you be? In the National Lung Cancer Screening trial, between 1 and 4 percent of people required invasive testing to follow-up their CT scans. Among those who had surgery, 25 percent of the nodules turned out to be benign. Looking at this a different way, In a more recent evaluation researchers looked at people in 2 separate studies.  In one of these (the Pan-American Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan,) 7008 nodules were found among 1871 people. Of these 102 were cancerous. In the other (a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) study,) 5001 nodules were found in 1090 people, with 42 being malignant. Crunching the numbers, this comes down to 5.5 percent of the people in one study and 3.7 percent in the other who had nodules that turned out to be cancerous. At this point, it’s important to note that these numbers — the likelihood that a nodule is cancerous —  are for healthy people without symptoms who are being screened. The likelihood of a nodule being malignant may be different for those who have symptoms. It may also be different for those who have a pulmonary nodule on screening but do not meet the criteria noted above. When is a Nodule More Likely to Be Cancer? Looking at studies to date, pulmonary nodules found on CT screening were more likely to be cancerous if: They were in the left or right upper lobes, and less likely to be malignant if they were in the right or left lower lobes, or in the right middle lobe. There was speculation of the nodule (meaning that instead of the abnormal area being round, it had spike like areas sticking out from the tumor,) or if the borders were irregular or lobulated. If they were larger. If they occurred in older people more than in younger people. If an individual had a family history of lung cancer. If they occurred in women more often than men. With increasing size of the nodule. In people with a history of emphysema. In people with fewer nodules. In addition: Part solid nodules were more likely to be cancerous than solid nodules. Solid nodules were more likely to be cancerous than non-solid nodules or nodules with a "ground glass" appearance. What Is My Nodule If It Isn’t Cancer? There are many causes of nodules ranging from infections to tuberculosis , to nodules associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and more. The following article discusses several benign and malignant causes of pulmonary nodules . Calculating Risk A lung cancer calculator is available for physicians (and the public) to estimate the chances that a nodule found on screening CT is malignant. This Nodule Prediction Calculator was developed based on scientific research, but people are cautioned that it's not a substitute for a physician's advice or treatment. The disclaimer people are asked to read emphasizes a very important point: Not all nodules that are high risk are cancer, and not all nodules that are low risk benign. Where Do You Go From Here? If your doctor determines that you have a pulmonary nodule or nodules, there are several approaches she may recommend. These will depend on several things including your risk factors for lung cancer, the appearance of the nodule, the location of the nodule, and your personal preference. Some options may include: A PET Scan A Bronchoscopy Watchful waiting A biopsy (There are several ways that a nodule may be biopsied depending upon its location.) Sources: Croswell, J. et al.

To be considered a lung nodule, the growth usually has to be smaller than 3 centimeters. Lung nodules are either considered noncancerous or cancerous. A noncancerous nodule is called benign, and a cancerous lung nodule is referred to as malignant.  Growths that are larger than 3 centimeters are usually called lung masses and typically have a higher chance of being cancerous.   Causes   A small growth on the lung is called a lung nodule. They are very common and may often be benign.   Although it can be frightening for an individual to be told they have a growth in their lung, a lung nodule does not always indicate lung cancer .  Lung nodules are very common. According to the American Thoracic Society, lung nodules can be found on up to 50 percent of adult chest imaging scans. The good news is fewer than 5 percent of lung nodules end up being cancer .  Noncancerous lung nodules can have a variety of causes, including:    Infection : Infections, such as tuberculosis , can cause inflammation . A group of cells called a granuloma may form around the inflamed area in the lung.   Non-infectious inflammation : Inflammation that is not related to an infection can also develop in the lung. For instance, rheumatoid arthritis can lead to inflammation in the lungs that results in a nodule.   Non-cancerous tumors : Non-cancerous growths, such as a fibroma, which is a benign growth of connective tissue, may also develop in the lung.   Although most lung nodules are not cancer, some do turn out to be malignant.  Certain risk factors that increase the chances a lung nodule are associated with cancer. For example, someone who has a history of smoking, is older than 60, or has a family history of cancer has a higher risk of a nodule being cancer.  Larger lung nodules are also more likely to be cancerous.             Symptoms  A lung nodule itself does not often cause any symptoms. Nodules are usually not large enough to interfere with breathing.  In some instances, however, symptoms of the condition that caused the nodule may be present. For example, if a lung nodule is due to lung cancer, symptoms may include:   shortness of breath  chest pain  coughing up blood  back pain  weight loss    Diagnosis   A CT scan may be performed after an initial X-ray to provide a more detailed image of a lung nodule.   A lung nodule usually shows up on a chest X-ray or a CT scan that has been carried out on a person who has symptoms of a respiratory illness.  The nodule will show up as a spot or shadow on the X-ray. If the nodule was found on a chest X-ray, a CT scan may also be performed. This test can provide more detailed images than an X-ray.  After a lung nodule is discovered, the doctor will look at its size, shape, and general appearance. Certain features may suggest that the nodule is more likely to be cancerous. For example, the larger a growth is, the more likely it is to be cancer.  The location of the nodule, as well as the shape and size, may also increase the chances of it being cancerous. The doctor will also consider the person's medical history, including smoking history, to evaluate the chances of the growth being cancerous.  Biopsy  If a person's risk factors for lung cancer are small and features of the nodule suggest a low likelihood of cancer, doing a biopsy may cause more harm than good. A small lung nodule can be difficult to biopsy, and there are risks, such as bleeding or a collapsed lung.  When the features of the nodule suggest that it may be cancerous, a biopsy may be recommended. A biopsy involves removing a small amount of tissue from the nodule. The tissue can be obtained through a needle biopsy or a bronchoscopy.  Bronchoscopy  A bronchoscopy involves inserting a thin tube into the lung through the mouth or nose and down the windpipe. The tube has a small camera, which allows the doctor to view the nodule. Special tools are then used to obtain a tissue sample.  Needle biopsy  Another option is a needle biopsy, which involves inserting a needle into the lung through the chest wall. This procedure is usually done with a guided CT scan.  The type of procedure used to get the tissue sample depends on the size and location of the nodule. After the sample is obtained, the tissue is examined under a microscope to look for the presence of cancer cells.             Treatment  Treatment for lung nodules will often depend on whether the nodule has the features that suggest that it may be cancerous.  Treatment for a noncancerous nodule   A healthcare professional will be able to advise on the best action to take for both noncancerous and cancerous nodules as the treatments will vary.   If the nodule has characteristics that suggest a low chance of cancer, the doctor may recommend taking a wait-and-see approach. The nodule may be monitored with repeat CT imaging scans over time to watch for any changes.  Some doctors may suggest CT scans at regular intervals for a few years to make sure the nodule does not increase in size. The doctor will determine how frequently to perform a follow-up scan based on various factors, such as a person's risk of cancer and the size of the nodule.  If the lung nodule does not change over about 2 years, it is unlikely to be cancer, and further imaging may not be needed.  If a lung nodule is due to an active infection, treatment is based on the condition identified. For example, if the nodule is due to tuberculosis, treatment for the infection will be started.  Treatment for a cancerous nodule  When a lung nodule is cancer, it is most often due to lung cancer, lymphoma , or cancer that has spread to the lung from another organ. If it is determined through a biopsy that the nodule is cancerous, treatment options may vary based on the type and stage of the cancer.  In some instances, when a lung nodule is identified as cancerous, it may be removed through a surgical procedure called a thoracotomy. The procedure involves making a cut through the chest wall into the lung to remove the nodule.  Additional treatment for cancerous lung nodules may include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and additional surgical procedures.   Prevention and outlook  The outlook for people with a lung nodule that is cancerous varies depending on the stage of the disease. In many cases, if lung cancer is found early, the long-term outlook is good.  Lung nodules that are noncancerous have a good outlook and usually do not cause any complications.  Depending on the cause, it may not be possible to prevent lung nodules from occurring. A person can decrease their chances of developing a lung nodule due to lung cancer, however.  Smoking is one of the main risk factors for getting lung cancer. According to the American Lung Association , the main cause of lung cancer in both women and men is smoking. In fact, about 90 percent of lung cancer cases are associated with smoking. As a result, quitting smoking may help reduce the risk of developing lung nodules.

To be considered a lung nodule, the growth usually has to be smaller than 3 centimeters. Lung nodules are either considered noncancerous or cancerous. A noncancerous nodule is called benign, and a cancerous lung nodule is referred to as malignant.  Growths that are larger than 3 centimeters are usually called lung masses and typically have a higher chance of being cancerous.   Causes   A small growth on the lung is called a lung nodule. They are very common and may often be benign.   Although it can be frightening for an individual to be told they have a growth in their lung, a lung nodule does not always indicate lung cancer .  Lung nodules are very common. According to the American Thoracic Society, lung nodules can be found on up to 50 percent of adult chest imaging scans. The good news is fewer than 5 percent of lung nodules end up being cancer .  Noncancerous lung nodules can have a variety of causes, including:    Infection : Infections, such as tuberculosis , can cause inflammation . A group of cells called a granuloma may form around the inflamed area in the lung.   Non-infectious inflammation : Inflammation that is not related to an infection can also develop in the lung. For instance, rheumatoid arthritis can lead to inflammation in the lungs that results in a nodule.   Non-cancerous tumors : Non-cancerous growths, such as a fibroma, which is a benign growth of connective tissue, may also develop in the lung.   Although most lung nodules are not cancer, some do turn out to be malignant.  Certain risk factors that increase the chances a lung nodule are associated with cancer. For example, someone who has a history of smoking, is older than 60, or has a family history of cancer has a higher risk of a nodule being cancer.  Larger lung nodules are also more likely to be cancerous.             Symptoms  A lung nodule itself does not often cause any symptoms. Nodules are usually not large enough to interfere with breathing.  In some instances, however, symptoms of the condition that caused the nodule may be present. For example, if a lung nodule is due to lung cancer, symptoms may include:   shortness of breath  chest pain  coughing up blood  back pain  weight loss    Diagnosis   A CT scan may be performed after an initial X-ray to provide a more detailed image of a lung nodule.   A lung nodule usually shows up on a chest X-ray or a CT scan that has been carried out on a person who has symptoms of a respiratory illness.  The nodule will show up as a spot or shadow on the X-ray. If the nodule was found on a chest X-ray, a CT scan may also be performed. This test can provide more detailed images than an X-ray.  After a lung nodule is discovered, the doctor will look at its size, shape, and general appearance. Certain features may suggest that the nodule is more likely to be cancerous. For example, the larger a growth is, the more likely it is to be cancer.  The location of the nodule, as well as the shape and size, may also increase the chances of it being cancerous. The doctor will also consider the person's medical history, including smoking history, to evaluate the chances of the growth being cancerous.  Biopsy  If a person's risk factors for lung cancer are small and features of the nodule suggest a low likelihood of cancer, doing a biopsy may cause more harm than good. A small lung nodule can be difficult to biopsy, and there are risks, such as bleeding or a collapsed lung.  When the features of the nodule suggest that it may be cancerous, a biopsy may be recommended. A biopsy involves removing a small amount of tissue from the nodule. The tissue can be obtained through a needle biopsy or a bronchoscopy.  Bronchoscopy  A bronchoscopy involves inserting a thin tube into the lung through the mouth or nose and down the windpipe. The tube has a small camera, which allows the doctor to view the nodule. Special tools are then used to obtain a tissue sample.  Needle biopsy  Another option is a needle biopsy, which involves inserting a needle into the lung through the chest wall. This procedure is usually done with a guided CT scan.  The type of procedure used to get the tissue sample depends on the size and location of the nodule. After the sample is obtained, the tissue is examined under a microscope to look for the presence of cancer cells.             Treatment  Treatment for lung nodules will often depend on whether the nodule has the features that suggest that it may be cancerous.  Treatment for a noncancerous nodule   A healthcare professional will be able to advise on the best action to take for both noncancerous and cancerous nodules as the treatments will vary.   If the nodule has characteristics that suggest a low chance of cancer, the doctor may recommend taking a wait-and-see approach. The nodule may be monitored with repeat CT imaging scans over time to watch for any changes.  Some doctors may suggest CT scans at regular intervals for a few years to make sure the nodule does not increase in size. The doctor will determine how frequently to perform a follow-up scan based on various factors, such as a person's risk of cancer and the size of the nodule.  If the lung nodule does not change over about 2 years, it is unlikely to be cancer, and further imaging may not be needed.  If a lung nodule is due to an active infection, treatment is based on the condition identified. For example, if the nodule is due to tuberculosis, treatment for the infection will be started.  Treatment for a cancerous nodule  When a lung nodule is cancer, it is most often due to lung cancer, lymphoma , or cancer that has spread to the lung from another organ. If it is determined through a biopsy that the nodule is cancerous, treatment options may vary based on the type and stage of the cancer.  In some instances, when a lung nodule is identified as cancerous, it may be removed through a surgical procedure called a thoracotomy. The procedure involves making a cut through the chest wall into the lung to remove the nodule.  Additional treatment for cancerous lung nodules may include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and additional surgical procedures.   Prevention and outlook  The outlook for people with a lung nodule that is cancerous varies depending on the stage of the disease. In many cases, if lung cancer is found early, the long-term outlook is good.  Lung nodules that are noncancerous have a good outlook and usually do not cause any complications.  Depending on the cause, it may not be possible to prevent lung nodules from occurring. A person can decrease their chances of developing a lung nodule due to lung cancer, however.  Smoking is one of the main risk factors for getting lung cancer. According to the American Lung Association , the main cause of lung cancer in both women and men is smoking. In fact, about 90 percent of lung cancer cases are associated with smoking. As a result, quitting smoking may help reduce the risk of developing lung nodules.

These growths are among the abnormalities our doctors evaluate in the Lung Cancer Early Detection & Prevention Clinic , and they sometimes lead to a lung cancer diagnosis.  What is a pulmonary nodule?   A pulmonary nodule is a small, roundish growth on the lung that measures three centimeters in diameter or less. Most pulmonary nodules are extremely small, less than one centimeter across. If the growth is larger than three centimeters, it is called a pulmonary mass.  Though pulmonary nodules may grow to become a pulmonary mass, some nodules may not grow at all.  What causes pulmonary nodules?  There are many causes of pulmonary nodules, including:  Infections, such as fungal or bacterial infections  Noncancerous processes, such as sarcoidosis  Cancerous processes, such as lung cancer, lymphoma or cancer that has spread from other organs  The likelihood that a pulmonary nodule is lung cancer depends on:  Your age  Your smoking history  Your history of exposure to environmental risk factors  Generally, less than 1 in 10 pulmonary nodules turns out to be lung cancer.  Symptoms of pulmonary nodules  Because pulmonary nodules are small, they rarely cause any symptoms. Some people might experience symptoms of a respiratory infection, such as a chest cold or mild flu.  Most pulmonary nodules are discovered by accident, when a patient gets a chest X-ray or a computed tomography (CT) scan for some other reason.  Evaluating a pulmonary nodule  The immediate goal of evaluating a pulmonary nodule is to determine its potential to be cancerous. Your doctor will ask about your personal and medical history and your environmental-exposure history, and you may have a chest CT scan.  If your doctor thinks you have a nodule with significant cancer potential and the nodule is one centimeter across or larger, they will use diagnostic procedures to determine the cause of the nodule.   There are many noninvasive or minimally invasive methods, such as:  Positron emission tomography (PET) scans  Bronchoscopy  Endobronchial ultrasound  CT-guided needle biopsy  Biopsy guided by fluoroscopy (moving X-ray)  If your pulmonary nodule cannot be diagnosed using one of these approaches, you may need surgery, such as:  Video-assisted thoracic surgery, done through a series of small incisions using a scope with a camera to see inside your chest  Open-chest surgery (thoracotomy)  Mini-thoracotomy (open-chest surgery with a smaller incision)  Once your doctor knows the cause of your pulmonary nodule, they can recommend a treatment plan tailored to you. If you are diagnosed with lung cancer, learn more about lung cancer treatment .  Following a pulmonary nodule  Most pulmonary nodules are too small (less than one centimeter across) to be diagnosed safely and accurately using any of the procedures or tests currently available. Because these very small pulmonary nodules can represent early lung cancer, they need to be followed closely using CT scans to evaluate whether they grow over time. If the size of these nodules doesn’t change for two years, the chance that they represent lung cancer is very small.

Lung nodules — small masses of tissue in the lung — are quite common. They appear as round, white shadows on a chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan.  Lung nodules are usually about 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) to 1.2 inches (30 millimeters) in size. A larger lung nodule, such as one that's 30 millimeters or larger, is more likely to be cancerous than is a smaller lung nodule.  If your doctor detects a lung nodule on an imaging test, it's helpful to compare your current imaging scan with a previous one. If the nodule on earlier images hasn't changed in size, shape or appearance in two years, it's probably noncancerous.  Noncancerous lung nodules are often caused by previous infections. Noncancerous lung nodules usually require no treatment. In some cases your doctor may recommend annual chest imaging to see if a lung nodule grows or changes over time.  If a lung nodule is new or has changed in size, shape or appearance, your doctor may recommend further testing — such as a CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, bronchoscopy or tissue biopsy — to determine if it's cancerous.

A pulmonary nodule is a small, roundish growth on the lung—sometimes called a spot
      on the lung—that is easy to find and hard to diagnose. Pulmonary nodules turn up in
      about one of every 500 chest x-rays. But because they can be a form of early-stage
      cancer, it’s important to distinguish a benign nodule from a cancerous nodule as early
      as possible. Therefore, doctors approach every pulmonary nodule as cancerous until
      they can prove otherwise.  If a spot on the lung has a diameter of three centimeters or less, it’s called a nodule.
      If it’s bigger than that, it’s called a mass and undergoes a different evaluation
      process. About 40 percent of pulmonary nodules turn out to be cancerous. Half of all
      patients treated for a cancerous pulmonary nodule live at least five years past the
      diagnosis. But if the nodule is one centimeter across or smaller, survival after five
      years rises to 80 percent. That’s why early detection is critical.  The Mechanics of Pulmonary Nodules  Benign pulmonary nodules are just that—benign. There is very little growth or change,
      if there’s any at all. Cancerous pulmonary nodules, however, are known to grow relatively
      quickly—usually doubling in size every four months but sometimes as fast as every
      25 days.  A cancerous nodule is a lesion or “sore” that steadily engulfs more and more of the
      structures of the lung. Over time the patient will experience shortness of breath,
      fatigue, and chest pain.  Symptoms of Pulmonary Nodules  The challenge in trying to identify pulmonary nodules before they become masses is
      that there are few, if any, symptoms to indicate a nodule might be present. The vast
      majority of pulmonary nodules—more than 90%—are discovered essentially by accident.
      They’re spotted incidentally in a chest x-ray or CT (computed tomography) scan performed
      for other purposes. If any symptoms do appear they tend to imitate characteristics
      common to a chest cold or a mild flu.  Causes of Pulmonary Nodules  Benign nodules are almost always healed over “wounds” on the lung left from tuberculosis
      or a fungal infection, although there are other, less common causes.  Cancerous nodules can be the first stage of a primary lung cancer, brought on by smoking
      or any other common cause of lung cancer. They also can be a secondary cancer that
      metastasized in the lungs from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.  Diagnosing Pulmonary Nodules  The diagnostic process focuses on determining whether a pulmonary nodule is cancerous
      or benign.  The most sure-fire way to make the distinction is by examining the growth rate of
      the nodule. Benign nodules do not grow much if at all. Cancerous nodules, on the other
      hand, can double in size on average every four months (some as quickly as 25 days,
      some as slowly as 15 months). Growth can be evaluated through a series of x-rays or
      CT (computed tomography) scans over a period of time.  The second most sure-fire way to distinguish a cancerous nodule from a benign nodule
      is to evaluate its calcification—that is, its development based on its shape and surface.
      Benign nodules tend to be smoother and more regularly shaped, with more even color
      throughout. Cancerous nodules are more likely to have irregular shapes, rougher surfaces,
      and color variations or speckled patterns.  In most cases, x-rays or CT scans provide enough information to make a reliable diagnosis.
      Doctors might choose to retrieve cells from the nodule for a biopsy. Cells are collected
      using a needle or performing localized surgery. In addition, an analysis of the patient’s
      sputum can provide diagnostic information.  Treating Pulmonary Nodules  In almost every case, benign pulmonary nodules require no treatment. Cancerous nodules,
      however, usually are treated by removing them surgically. Several surgical procedures
      are used, depending on the size, condition and location of the nodule:   Video-assisted thorocoscopic surgery is a procedure similar to “scoping” an injured knee. The surgeon inserts the thorascopic
         device into the lung and withdraws the offending nodule tissue.  A mini-thoracotomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that zeros in on the nodule. It is chosen
         instead of a full thoracotomy whenever possible.  A thoracotomy is a comprehensive, invasive procedure whose goal is removal of the diseased portion
         of the lung—sometime a sizeable “wedge” of the organ.   ABCs of Nodules Concerned about pulmonary nodules? Follow these ABCs: A is for Age —few cases before 35, most cases after 45. B is for Before —compare today’s x-rays with those taken before for any change. C is for Calcium —nodules get their revealing shapes as a result of calcification. And S is for Smoking —if you smoke, quit and get checked.
