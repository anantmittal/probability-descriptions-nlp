Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Hills, Ingrid B. Rabe, Marc Fischer  INFECTIOUS AGENT  Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus and is closely related to West Nile and Saint Louis encephalitis viruses.  TRANSMISSION  JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily Culex species. The virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and amplifying vertebrate hosts, primarily pigs and wading birds. Humans are incidental or dead-end hosts, because they usually do not develop a level or duration of viremia sufficient to infect mosquitoes.  EPIDEMIOLOGY  JE virus is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis in Asia, occurring throughout most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific ( Map 3-08 ). Local transmission of JE virus has not been detected in Africa, Europe, or the Americas. Transmission principally occurs in rural agricultural areas, often associated with rice cultivation and flood irrigation. In some areas of Asia, these ecologic conditions may occur near, or occasionally within, urban centers. In temperate areas of Asia, transmission is seasonal, and human disease usually peaks in summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, seasonal transmission varies with monsoon rains and irrigation practices and may be prolonged or even occur year-round.  In endemic countries, where adults have acquired immunity through natural infection, JE is primarily a disease of children. However, travel-associated JE can occur among people of any age. For most travelers to Asia, the risk for JE is extremely low but varies based on destination, duration, season, and activities.  From 1973 through 2015, 79 JE cases among travelers or expatriates from nonendemic countries were published or reported to CDC. From the time a JE vaccine became available in the United States in 1993, through 2015, only 10 JE cases among US travelers were reported to CDC.  The overall incidence of JE among people from nonendemic countries traveling to Asia is estimated to be <1 case per 1 million travelers. However, expatriates and travelers who stay for prolonged periods in rural areas with active JE virus transmission are likely at similar risk as the susceptible resident population (5–50 cases per 100,000 children per year). Travelers on even brief trips might be at increased risk if they have extensive outdoor or nighttime exposure in rural areas during periods of active transmission. Short-term (<1 month) travelers whose visits are restricted to major urban areas are at minimal risk for JE. In some endemic areas, although there are few human cases among residents because of natural immunity among older people or vaccination, JE virus is still maintained locally in an enzootic cycle between animals and mosquitoes. Therefore, susceptible visitors may be at risk for infection.     Map 3-08. Distribution of Japanese encephalitis   PDF Version (printable)     CLINICAL PRESENTATION  Most human infections with JE virus are asymptomatic; <1% of people infected with JE virus develop clinical disease. Acute encephalitis is the most commonly recognized clinical manifestation of JE virus infection. Milder forms of disease, such as aseptic meningitis or undifferentiated febrile illness, can also occur. The incubation period is 5– 15 days. Illness usually begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting. Mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits, generalized weakness, and movement disorders may develop over the next few days. The classical description of JE includes a parkinsonian syndrome with mask-like facies, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and choreoathetoid movements. Acute flaccid paralysis, with clinical and pathological features similar to those of poliomyelitis, has also been associated with JE virus infection. Seizures are common, especially among children. The case-fatality ratio is approximately 20%–30%. Among survivors, 30%–50% have serious neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric sequelae.  Common clinical laboratory findings include moderate leukocytosis, mild anemia, and hyponatremia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically has a mild to moderate pleocytosis with a lymphocytic predominance, slightly elevated protein, and normal ratio of CSF to plasma glucose.  DIAGNOSIS  JE should be suspected in a patient with evidence of a neurologic infection (such as encephalitis, meningitis, or acute flaccid paralysis) who has recently traveled to or resided in an endemic country in Asia or the western Pacific. Laboratory diagnosis of JE virus infection should be performed by using a JE virus–specific IgM-capture ELISA on CSF or serum. JE virus–specific IgM can be measured in the CSF of most patients by 4 days after onset of symptoms and in serum by 7 days after onset. Plaque reduction neutralization tests can be performed to confirm the presence of JE virus–specific neutralizing antibodies and discriminate between cross-reacting antibodies from closely related flaviviruses (such as dengue and West Nile viruses). A ≥4-fold rise in JE virus– specific neutralizing antibodies between acute-and convalescent-phase serum specimens may be used to confirm recent infection. Vaccination history, date of onset of symptoms, and information regarding other flaviviruses known to circulate in the geographic area that may cross-react in serologic assays need to be considered when interpreting results.  Humans have low levels of transient viremia and usually have neutralizing antibodies by the time distinctive clinical symptoms are recognized. Virus isolation and nucleic-acid amplification tests are insensitive in detecting JE virus or viral RNA in blood or CSF and should not be used for ruling out a diagnosis of JE. Clinicians should contact their state or local health department or CDC at 970-221-6400 for assistance with diagnostic testing.  TREATMENT  There is no specific antiviral treatment for JE; therapy consists of supportive care and management of complications.  PREVENTION  Personal Protection Measures  The best way to prevent mosquitoborne diseases, including JE, is to avoid mosquito bites (see Chapter 2, Protection against Mosquitoes, Ticks, & Other Arthropods ).  Vaccine  One JE vaccine is licensed and available in the United States—an inactivated Vero cell culture– derived vaccine, Ixiaro ( Table 3-06 ). Ixiaro is manufactured by Valneva Scotland Limited and distributed in the United States by VaxServe (a Sanofi Pasteur company). It was approved in March 2009 for use in people aged ≥17 years and in May 2013 for use in children aged 2 months through 16 years. Other inactivated and live attenuated JE vaccines are manufactured and used in other countries but are not licensed for use in the United States.  INDICATIONS FOR USE OF JE VACCINE FOR TRAVELERS  When making recommendations regarding the use of JE vaccine for travelers, clinicians must weigh the overall low risk of travel-associated JE, the high rate of death and disability when JE occurs, the low probability of serious adverse events after immunization, and the cost of the vaccine. Evaluation of a traveler’s risk should take into account the planned itinerary, including travel location, duration, activities, and seasonal patterns of disease in the areas to be visited ( Table 3-07 ). The data in the table should be interpreted cautiously, because JE virus transmission activity varies within countries and from year to year.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends JE vaccine for travelers who plan to spend ≥1 month in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. This includes long-term travelers, recurrent travelers, or expatriates who will be based in urban areas but are likely to visit endemic rural or agricultural areas during a high-risk period of JE virus transmission. Vaccine should also be considered for the following:   Short-term (<1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of JE virus exposure. Examples of higher-risk activities or itineraries include 1) spending substantial time outdoors in rural or agricultural areas, especially during the evening or night; 2) participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming); and 3) staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.  Travelers to an area with an ongoing JE outbreak.  Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific destinations, activities, or duration of travel.   JE vaccine is not recommended for short-term travelers whose visits will be restricted to urban areas or times outside a well-defined JE virus transmission season.  VACCINE EFFICACY AND IMMUNOGENICITY  There are no efficacy data for Ixiaro. The vaccine was licensed in the United States on the basis of its ability to induce JE virus neutralizing antibodies as a surrogate for protection, as well as safety evaluations in almost 5,000 adults. In pivotal immunogenicity studies, 96% of adults and 100% of children aged 2 months through 17 years developed protective neutralizing antibodies at 28 days after receiving a primary immunization series of 2 doses administered 28 days apart. Among adults aged ≥65 years, 65% are seroprotected at 42 days after the 2-dose primary series.  A study in adults on persistence of protective neutralizing antibodies after a primary 2-dose series of Ixiaro showed that at 5 years postvaccination, 82% of subjects were seroprotected. However, the study was conducted in areas where tickborne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine is available. In a subgroup analysis, seroprotection rates at 24– 60 months in the TBE vaccine group ranged from 94%–100%, compared with 64%–72% in the group in which TBE vaccine was not administered. TBE vaccine is not available in the United States; therefore, JE seroprotection rates for US travelers are likely to be most similar to the rates in the group not administered TBE vaccine.  One observational study investigated long-term protection following a booster dose of Ixiaro in adults. After a booster dose administered at 15 months, 96% of subjects were still seroprotected approximately 6 years later.  There are limited data on duration of seroprotection and need for a booster dose in children. In a study conducted among children from non-endemic countries, 89% were seroprotected at 3 years after a primary 2-dose series of Ixiaro. This rate was higher than that in a comparative adult study. In a study conducted among children in a JE-endemic country, 90% of children were seroprotected at 36 months after the primary series. Seroprotection rates were variable by age group, but at least 81% of children in each age group were seroprotected.  An accelerated primary series of 2 doses of Ixiaro administered 7 days apart has been studied in adults aged 18–65 years. In the accelerated schedule group, 99% of adults were seroprotected, compared with 100% of adults in the standard schedule group. The accelerated primary series was noninferior to the conventional dosing schedule. An accelerated schedule (administered on days 0 and 7) has been licensed for use in Europe.  VACCINE ADMINISTRATION  The primary immunization schedule for Ixiaro is 2 doses administered intramuscularly on days 0 and 28 (Table 3-6). For children aged 2 months through 2 years, each dose is 0.25 mL, and for adults and children aged ≥3 years, each dose is 0.5 mL. To administer a 0.25-mL dose, health care providers must expel and discard half of the volume from the 0.5-mL prefilled syringe by pushing the plunger stopper up to the edge of the red line on the syringe barrel before injection. The 2-dose series should be completed ≥1 week before travel.  BOOSTER DOSES  For adults, if the primary series of Ixiaro was administered >1 year previously, a booster dose should be given before potential reexposure or if there is a continued risk for JE virus infection. Data on the response to a booster dose administered ≥2 years after the primary series are not available.  There are limited data on the use of Ixiaro as a booster dose after a primary series with the mouse brain–derived inactivated JE vaccine. Two studies have been conducted, 1 in US military personnel and the other at 2 travel clinics in Europe. Both studies demonstrated that in adults who had previously received at least a primary series of mouse brain–derived inactivated JE vaccine, a single dose of Ixiaro adequately boosted neutralizing antibody levels and provided at least short-term protection. In addition, seroprotective titers against both vaccine virus strains persisted in all participants who could be followed up at 2 years in the European study (N = 18). However, additional data are needed on the duration of protection after a single dose of Ixiaro in prior recipients of a mouse brain–derived vaccine. Until those data are available, people who have received JEVax, the mouse brain–derived vaccine formerly used in the United States, and require further vaccination against JE virus, should receive a 2-dose primary series of Ixiaro.  VACCINE SAFETY AND ADVERSE REACTIONS  Local symptoms of pain and tenderness were the most commonly reported symptoms in a safety study with 1,993 adult participants who received 2 doses of Ixiaro. Headache, myalgia, fatigue, and an influenzalike illness were each reported at a rate of >10%. In children, fever was the most commonly reported systemic reaction in studies.  PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS  A severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of Ixiaro or any other JE vaccine, or to any component of Ixiaro, is a contraindication to administration of Ixiaro. Ixiaro contains protamine sulfate, a compound known to cause hypersensitivity reactions in some people. No studies of Ixiaro in pregnant women have been conducted. Therefore, administration of Ixiaro to pregnant women usually should be deferred. However, pregnant women who must travel to an area where risk for JE virus infection is high should be vaccinated when the theoretical risk of immunization is outweighed by the risk of infection.

I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?      What is Japanese encephalitis?  Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a potentially severe disease. JE is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes in Asia and the western Pacific. JE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).  Where does Japanese encephalitis occur?  JE occurs in Asia and parts of the western Pacific. It usually occurs in rural or agricultural areas, often associated with rice farming. In temperate areas of Asia, transmission is seasonal, and human disease usually peaks in the summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.  How soon do people get sick after being bitten by an infected mosquito?  It takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms.   Top of Page  What are the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis?  Most people who are infected develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, initial symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. The disease can progress to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and is often accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis occur in some cases.   Top of Page  How is Japanese encephalitis diagnosed?  Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory tests of blood or spinal fluid. These tests typically detect antibodies that the immune system makes against the viral infection.   Top of Page  What is the treatment for Japanese encephalitis?  There is no specific treatment. Severe illnesses are treated by supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, and intravenous fluids.   Top of Page  What should I do if I think a family member might have Japanese encephalitis?  Consult a healthcare provider for evaluation and diagnosis.   Top of Page  How can people reduce the chance of getting infected?   Use insect repellent and wear long pants and sleeves  Sleep in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms or use bed nets  A vaccine against JE virus is available. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether this vaccine is right for you.    Top of Page  Who should get Japanese encephalitis vaccine?  JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend at least 1 month in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. Vaccine should also be considered for the following:   Short-term (less than 1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of exposure. Higher-risk activities include participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming) and staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.  Travelers to an area with an ongoing outbreak.  Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific travel destinations, activities, or duration.    Top of Page  How long does the Japanese encephalitis vaccination last?  The duration of protection is unknown. For persons aged 17 years and older, a booster dose may be given if the primary two-dose vaccination series was given one year or more previously and there is continued risk of exposure. Although studies are being conducted on the need for a booster dose for children, data are not yet available.   Top of Page  What are the side effects of Japanese encephalitis vaccination?  Pain and tenderness are the most commonly reported symptoms. Headache, muscle pain and fatigue can also occur.   Top of Page  I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?  Consult with your healthcare provider. Ask your healthcare provider to report your case to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) if he or she thinks the vaccine has made you sick.

JE is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes in Asia and the western Pacific. JE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).  Where does Japanese encephalitis occur?  JE occurs in Asia and parts of the western Pacific. It usually occurs in rural or agricultural areas, often associated with rice farming. In temperate areas of Asia, transmission is seasonal, and human disease usually peaks in the summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.  How soon do people get sick after being bitten by an infected mosquito?  It takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms.   Top of Page  What are the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis?  Most people who are infected develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, initial symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. The disease can progress to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and is often accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis occur in some cases.   Top of Page  How is Japanese encephalitis diagnosed?  Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory tests of blood or spinal fluid. These tests typically detect antibodies that the immune system makes against the viral infection.   Top of Page  What is the treatment for Japanese encephalitis?  There is no specific treatment. Severe illnesses are treated by supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, and intravenous fluids.   Top of Page  What should I do if I think a family member might have Japanese encephalitis?  Consult a healthcare provider for evaluation and diagnosis.   Top of Page  How can people reduce the chance of getting infected?   Use insect repellent and wear long pants and sleeves  Sleep in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms or use bed nets  A vaccine against JE virus is available. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether this vaccine is right for you.    Top of Page  Who should get Japanese encephalitis vaccine?  JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend at least 1 month in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. Vaccine should also be considered for the following:   Short-term (less than 1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of exposure. Higher-risk activities include participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming) and staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.  Travelers to an area with an ongoing outbreak.  Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific travel destinations, activities, or duration.    Top of Page  How long does the Japanese encephalitis vaccination last?  The duration of protection is unknown. For persons aged 17 years and older, a booster dose may be given if the primary two-dose vaccination series was given one year or more previously and there is continued risk of exposure. Although studies are being conducted on the need for a booster dose for children, data are not yet available.   Top of Page  What are the side effects of Japanese encephalitis vaccination?  Pain and tenderness are the most commonly reported symptoms. Headache, muscle pain and fatigue can also occur.   Top of Page  I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?  Consult with your healthcare provider. Ask your healthcare provider to report your case to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) if he or she thinks the vaccine has made you sick.

Japanese encephalitis is one of the many mosquito-borne diseases you might hear mentioned as you prepare for your trip. Potentially, it's more lethal than dengue and Chikungunya, the better known, but (generally) more benign diseases spread by mozzies in tropical and sub-tropical regions.  In fact, in terms of potential severity, Japanese encephalitis (or JE as it is known) ranks closer to yellow fever or malaria, but with far fewer cases – particularly among travellers.  There have been only 62 documented travel-related cases of JE in the past 40 years, although an estimated 30,000-50,000 people living in the rural rice-growing, pig-farming areas where the disease typically occurs are infected each year.  That makes JE a rare event among travellers. But, 'rare' does not mean 'never', as 2 recent worrying cases involving travellers show.  Two unusual recent cases They're worrying because their separate itineraries did not fit the usual criteria for recommending JE vaccination. Both patients were healthy young men who spent only a short time in Thailand and had no exposure (as far as we know) in the higher-risk rice-growing areas. CASE 1 – A 20-year-old Spaniard who travelled to Thailand for a martial arts competition in March this year enjoyed a very common itinerary in popular areas of Thailand. It began with 2 days in a Bangkok hotel, followed by stays in bungalows on two beaches (Chaweng and Lamai) on Koh Samui Island. He visited rural areas, including a forest and waterfalls, where he recalls receiving mosquito bites. Four months later, including a 2-month stay in hospital, the previously healthy young sportsman is able to walk again, if unsteadily, but has memory loss. His case was described in a Eurosurveillance report . CASE 2 – A Chinese man, also aged 20, became ill with a fever in Thailand in late August after a 3-week stay. Fortunately, was able to return home and is in a stable condition undergoing treatment in hospital in Hong Kong. It is not yet known where he stayed or the places he visited while in Thailand. (Hong Kong has now seen 2 'imported' and 4 locally acquired cases in the past two years.) Source : The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) – Hong Kong. Which travellers are most at risk? Travellers considered to be most at risk of JE in Asia are those who are: - staying longer than month, especially in rural areas during the local JE transmission season. - Working or studying in ANY areas of a country where JE is common (endemic) for an extended period. - visiting an area with an ongoing JE outbreak. - uncertain of specific destinations, activities, or duration of travel in an endemic area. Typically, JE vaccination is recommended for backpackers passing through regional areas, rural-based aid workers, and expats living or working in an endemic region. However, because travellers have been infected after shorter periods of travel, the Australian Immunisation Handbook recommends that doctors consider advising vaccination if: – Travel is taking place during the wet season, and/or there is considerable outdoor activity, and/or the accommodation may not be mosquito-proof. – The traveller is spending a year or more in Asia (except Singapore) – even if much of their time will be spent in urban areas, and – The itinerary includes a month or more in Papua New Guinea, particularly during the wet season. Rare risk of severe illness These young men were doubly unlucky: Firstly, to get JE and, secondly, to develop a severe illness. For most of those infected, there are no symptoms or they're mild and self-limiting. But, for the less than 1% whose infection is severe, the statistics tell us that 20-30% will die and 30% - 50% will suffer a severe disability. In short, JE is a travel disease with a relatively low risk, but with potentially severe consequences. There are two excellent vaccines against Japanese encephalitis that should be considered by all travellers visiting Thailand and other risk areas of Asia, especially those expecting to get off the beaten track. Discuss your plans and detailed itinerary with your doctor, ideally one experienced in travel medicine. - Dr Eddy Bajrovic, Medical Director, Travelvax Australia. More about Japanese encephalitis About the virus – Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) closely related to the West Nile, St Louis encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue fever viruses. The symptoms – The virus affects the brain. Most JE virus infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms. However, less than 1% of infections results in severe disease that starts with high fever and may progress to coma and death. How it's spread – JE is transmitted in an 'enzootic cycle'. That is, mosquitoes usually transmit the disease to people after biting infected animals - mainly pigs and wading birds - that serve as 'hosts' to the virus. There is no person-to-person transmission. Where it occurs – JE occurs across most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific, where an estimated 35,000- 50,000 cases occur each year. Most are among local people living in rice-producing areas of 3 main regions: China (June through October) and Korea (May-October); Indian subcontinent – India (May–October, especially northern states; year-round in some southern states), Bangladesh (May–October), Nepal (June-October), Sri Lanka (year-round; variable monsoon peaks), and Pakistan (unknown); Southeast Asia – Myanmar (May–October), Thailand (year-round; seasonal peaks May–October, especially in the north), Cambodia (May–October), Laos (June – September), Vietnam (year-round; seasonal peaks May–October, especially in the north), Malaysia (year-round transmission; peak Oct–Dec in Sarawak), Indonesia (year-round; peak season varies by island; Bali year-round), and the Philippines (unknown; probably year-round). (JE also occurs occasionally in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Eastern Russia, Guam, Saipan, and Brunei Darussalam during the wet and early dry seasons. More recently JE has become established in Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands, with the occasional case in Northern Australia.) How you can prevent JE CONSIDER VACCINATION For those travellers who feel they may be at risk or wish to have the additional protection of immunisation against JE, two vaccines are available to Australian travellers. Imojev – The newest vaccine is a single-dose vaccine suitable for adults and infants/children 12 months and older. It provides 94% protection after 14 days. Because the vaccine is new, a booster dose is not recommended at this stage. Jespect – 2 intramuscular doses a month apart. Although it is registered for use in Australia for persons 18 years and older, it is also suitable for infants/children 12 months and older, if the alternative vaccine Imojev is contraindicated. Information regarding boosting is limited, but a single booster dose may be recommended after 12 months, if the risk of exposure continues. Read more about these vaccines, the schedules, protection levels, and potential side effects. AVOID MOZZIE BITES In any tropical region, preventing insect bites is vital – especially as malaria, dengue fever, Chikungunya fever, and other insect-borne diseases are even more likely to be present. Here are some simple bite-prevention measures you can take: - Apply mosquito repellent containing an effective active ingredient, such as DEET, Picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus to all exposed skin when outdoors. - Wear protective clothing (loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and long pants). - If possible, staying indoors at twilight and after dark. - Sleep under a mosquito net impregnated with Permethrin or Deltamethrin (which are available from Travelvax clinics ), particularly if your accommodation does not have insect screens or air conditioning. - Use mosquito coils and knock-down aerosol insecticides, if needed.

Transmission   Pigs and various wild birds represent the natural reservoir of this virus, which is transmitted to new animal hosts and occasionally
humans by mosquitoes of the genus Culex .  Nature of the disease   Most infections in humans are asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, severity varies: mild infections are characterized by febrile
headache or aseptic meningitis followed by an uneventful recovery; severe cases have a rapid onset and progression with
headache, high fever and meningeal signs. Permanent neurological sequelae are common among survivors. Approximately 25%
of severe clinical cases have a fatal outcome.  Geographical distribution   Japanese encephalitis virus is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and occurs in almost all Asian countries (see map).
Transmission occurs principally in rural agricultural locations where flooding irrigation is practised – some of which may be near
or within urban centres. Transmission is related mainly to the rainy season in south-east Asia but may take place all year round,
particularly in tropical climate zones. In the temperate regions of China, Japan, the Korean peninsula and eastern parts of the
Russian Federation, transmission occurs mainly during the summer and autumn.   Largely as a result of immunization, the incidence of Japanese encephalitis has been declining in Japan and the Republic of
Korea, in some regions of China, and more recently in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. However, transmission of the
virus remains unaffected by immunization, and non-immunized individuals remain at risk. The disease is also reported from
Bangladesh, parts of India and Pakistan, and from Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Philippines and other
countries in the region ( see map ).  Risk for travellers   The risk of Japanese encephalitis is very low for most travellers to Asia, particularly for short-term visitors to urban areas.
However, the risk varies according to season, destination, duration of travel and activities. Vaccination is recommended for
travellers with extensive outdoor exposure (camping, hiking, working, etc.) during the transmission season, particularly in
endemic countries or areas where flooding irrigation is practised. In areas at risk, Japanese encephalitis is primarily a disease of
children, but it can occur in travellers of any age. Prevention is by avoidance of mosquito bites (Chapter 3) and by vaccination.

JEV is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 68 000 clinical cases every year.  Although symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE) is rare, the case-fatality rate among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30%. Permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae can occur in 30%–50% of those with encephalitis.  24 countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions have endemic JEV transmission, exposing more than 3 billion people to risks of infection.  There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection.  Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent JE. WHO recommends that JE vaccination be integrated into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE disease is recognized as a public health issue.     Japanese encephalitis virus JEV is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and belongs to the same genus as dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses.   The first case of Japanese encephalitis viral disease (JE) was documented in 1871 in Japan.   The annual incidence of clinical disease varies both across and within endemic countries, ranging from <1 to >10 per 100 000 population or higher during outbreaks. A literature review estimates nearly 68 000 clinical cases of JE globally each year, with approximately 13 600 to 20 400 deaths. JE primarily affects children. Most adults in endemic countries have natural immunity after childhood infection, but individuals of any age may be affected.  Signs and symptoms   Most JEV infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately 1 in 250 infections results in severe clinical illness. Severe disease is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately death. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 30% among those with disease symptoms.   Of those who survive, 20%–30% suffer permanent intellectual, behavioural or neurological problems such as paralysis, recurrent seizures or the inability to speak.  Transmission   24 countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions have JEV transmission risk, which includes more than 3 billion people.   JEV is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the Culex species (mainly Culex tritaeniorhynchus ). Humans, once infected, do not develop sufficient viraemia to infect feeding mosquitoes. The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and/or water birds (enzootic cycle). The disease is predominantly found in rural and periurban settings, where humans live in closer proximity to these vertebrate hosts.   In most temperate areas of Asia, JEV is transmitted mainly during the warm season, when large epidemics can occur. In the tropics and subtropics, transmission can occur year-round but often intensifies during the rainy season and pre-harvest period in rice-cultivating regions.  Diagnosis   Individuals who live in or have travelled to a JE-endemic area and experience encephalitis are considered a suspected JE case. To confirm JEV infection and to rule out other causes of encephalitis requires a laboratory testing of serum or, preferentially, cerebrospinal fluid.   Surveillance of the disease is mostly syndromic for acute encephalitis. Confirmatory laboratory testing is often conducted in dedicated sentinel sites, and efforts are undertaken to expand laboratory-based surveillance. Case-based surveillance is established in countries that effectively control JE through vaccination.  Treatment   There is no antiviral treatment for patients with JE. Treatment is supportive to relieve symptoms and stabilize the patient.  Prevention and control   Safe and effective JE vaccines are available to prevent disease. WHO recommends having strong JE prevention and control activities, including JE immunization in all regions where the disease is a recognized public health priority, along with strengthening surveillance and reporting mechanisms. Even if the number of JE-confirmed cases is low, vaccination should be considered where there is a suitable environment for JE virus transmission. There is little evidence to support a reduction in JE disease burden from interventions other than the vaccination of humans.   There are 4 main types of JE vaccines currently in use: inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines, inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, and live recombinant vaccines.   Over the past years, the live attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine manufactured in China has become the most widely used vaccine in endemic countries, and it was prequalified by WHO in October 2013. Cell-culture based inactivated vaccines and the live recombinant vaccine based on the yellow fever vaccine strain have also been licensed and WHO-prequalified. In November 2013, Gavi opened a funding window to support JE vaccination campaigns in eligible countries.   All travellers to Japanese encephalitis-endemic areas should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites to reduce the risk for JE. Personal preventive measures include the use of repellents, long-sleeved clothes, coils and vaporizers. Travellers spending extensive time in JE endemic areas are recommended to get vaccinated.  Disease outbreaks   Major outbreaks of JE occur every 2-15 years. JE transmission intensifies during the rainy season, during which vector populations increase. However, there has not yet been evidence of increased JEV transmission following major floods or tsunamis. The spread of JEV in new areas has been correlated with agricultural development and intensive rice cultivation supported by irrigation programmes.   WHO responds to JE by:   providing global recommendations for JE control, including the use of vaccines. WHO recommends JE immunization in all regions where the disease is a recognized public health priority and supports implementation.  providing technical support for JE surveillance, JE vaccine introduction and large-scale JE vaccination campaigns, and evaluation of JE vaccine effectiveness and programmatic impact.

I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?      What is Japanese encephalitis?  Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a potentially severe disease. JE is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes in Asia and the western Pacific. JE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).  Where does Japanese encephalitis occur?  JE occurs in Asia and parts of the western Pacific. It usually occurs in rural or agricultural areas, often associated with rice farming. In temperate areas of Asia, transmission is seasonal, and human disease usually peaks in the summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.  How soon do people get sick after being bitten by an infected mosquito?  It takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms.   Top of Page  What are the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis?  Most people who are infected develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, initial symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. The disease can progress to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and is often accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis occur in some cases.   Top of Page  How is Japanese encephalitis diagnosed?  Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory tests of blood or spinal fluid. These tests typically detect antibodies that the immune system makes against the viral infection.   Top of Page  What is the treatment for Japanese encephalitis?  There is no specific treatment. Severe illnesses are treated by supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, and intravenous fluids.   Top of Page  What should I do if I think a family member might have Japanese encephalitis?  Consult a healthcare provider for evaluation and diagnosis.   Top of Page  How can people reduce the chance of getting infected?   Use insect repellent and wear long pants and sleeves  Sleep in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms or use bed nets  A vaccine against JE virus is available. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether this vaccine is right for you.    Top of Page  Who should get Japanese encephalitis vaccine?  JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend at least 1 month in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. Vaccine should also be considered for the following:   Short-term (less than 1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of exposure. Higher-risk activities include participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming) and staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.  Travelers to an area with an ongoing outbreak.  Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific travel destinations, activities, or duration.    Top of Page  How long does the Japanese encephalitis vaccination last?  The duration of protection is unknown. For persons aged 17 years and older, a booster dose may be given if the primary two-dose vaccination series was given one year or more previously and there is continued risk of exposure. Although studies are being conducted on the need for a booster dose for children, data are not yet available.   Top of Page  What are the side effects of Japanese encephalitis vaccination?

25% of cases in which the brain is affected are fatal.  Travelers to South Korea should consider receiving the vaccination against Japanese encephalitis.  Children have a higher risk than adults of contracting Japanese encephalitis.  In a recent test conducted in the city of Busan, 64% of the mosquitoes that were examined tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. These findings prompted the Korea Centers for Disease Control to issue a nationwide alert.     A viral infection that is most commonly characterized by mild symptoms to no visible symptoms at all, Japanese encephalitis Japanese Encephalitis Risk to Travelers Risk of infection for those who will be traveling to areas that have reported cases of Japanese encephalitis is relatively low. Nevertheless, travelers are advised to take precautions, as infection may occur. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes that belong to the Culex species, namely Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Transmission most commonly occurs in rural agricultural parts of Asia, where rice production and regular flooding often take place. Transmission is seasonal in temperate parts of Asia with summer and fall being the times of year during which the highest number of human cases are reported. The disease may be transmitted at any time of the year in tropical and subtropical regions, though the number of cases may peak during the rainy season. Japanese Encephalitis in South Korea Travelers to South Korea, in particular, should consider receiving the vaccination against Japanese encephalitis. In a recent test that was conducted in the city of Busan, 64 percent of the mosquitoes that were examined tested positive for the disease. The results of the tests prompted the Korea Centers for Disease Control to issue a nationwide alert. Because mosquitoes in the area are most active until the end of October, people are advised to use mosquito nets and to limit their time spent outside during the warmer months. Researchers believe changes in climate are helping mosquitoes that are affected by the disease breed in ever greater numbers. Most Vulnerable Groups Children have a higher risk than adults of contracting Japanese encephalitis. In response to the perceived threat the disease may pose for children in the Korean peninsula, the global relief group Carnitas has vaccinated 430,000 children in the peninsula against the virus at the time of this writing. The group plans to vaccinate 2.3 million children against the disease by the end of 2013.

Feb 26, 2013, 11:14 AM      Will be going to Japan in May to mid-June. I am very unsure if I should or should not get this vaccine. Some doctors say if I am in the country more than 3 weeks it would be nessicary, others say if I am living in the woods, on farms etc more than three to four weeks then it would be nessicary....     Will be traveling across the country by train and air. Will stay only in big cities like Tokyo, Fukuoka , Sapporo etc...     Will probably visit forests or mountain ranges for sightseeing (like the national parks in Hokkaido , around Kagoshima volcano, in the southern Kyushuu peninsula, etc.) on day-trips, no sleeping in the woods or so.     The doctor frieghtened me that a mosquito could probably come and bite me after biting a pig with the disease even if I am in Tokyo. Some say it is not possible to protect myself from mosquitoes with bug spray or roll-ons, and wearing long shirt/pants seem very inconvenient in the summer.     So I am very clueless and soon it would be too late to take this vaccine since I will leave in almost 2 months. All these stories and stuff from doctors and others make me frightened to death a mosquito will come and bite me and then it would be the end of life. At the same time I am frightened the vaccine itself will give terrible side effects. It might be the old vaccine but rumor goes it could give encephalitis itself.

Re: Japanese encephalitis vaccine....   Feb 26, 2013, 11:41 AM      I lived in Japan for 8 years and have visited almost yearly since then (past 15 years). I had never heard of Japanese encephalitis until recently. I can't tell you what to do, but you can google and find that it is extremely rare in Japan today--fewer than 10 cases/year since the early '90s. According to the CDC website, there was a small outbreak in 2002.     …cdc.gov/travel/…1938     The incidence of West Nile Virus in the US is much, much higher.

Feb 27, 2013, 2:01 AM      So even if I would visit the countryside for a daytrip should I be worried if I saw a mosquito bite later? Should I trust the doctor then a mosquito could fly from a pig farm to Tokyo and bite me, thinking like that would mean you could not even open the window or get off the plane at Narita at all.     I dont know why they say here if I stay in Japan more than three months it is good to get the vaccine. Could as well happen if i stay in just a week I mean. But would it need just one mosquito bite or would it need hundreds? Maybe that is why they mean more than three weeks.   I dont want to be freightened I will die or be brain damaged if I see a mosquito bite.     This bug repellent, are there any brands that might be more or less     Sorry if I seem worried but since I was recently frightened by doctors I wanted to ease my mind.

Feb 27, 2013, 3:14 AM      My view is that the doctor is more interested in his own income than your health. Vaccinations are quick, easy and profitable for doctors, and some have been known to recommend vaccinations for countries they really know nothing about.     If you want to get an insect repellant, get one with the active ingredient DEET. There are numerous brands available in many countries.

Feb 27, 2013, 6:20 AM      Despite the name "Japanese encephalitis", cases of "Japanese encephalitis" IN Japan are EXTREMELY rare.     If you look at this map:   …wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Japanese_encephalit…     Cases are nearly zero to 1 very very very rare chance in Japan.     It is "Japanese" only in name, but rarely found in Japan.     In all the years I've been in Japan, I never got the vaccine, nor have I ever thought about getting the vaccine since it's pretty extremely rare that anyone would get it.

Feb 27, 2013, 7:54 AM      Okay. I feel very convenienced at last. Living in a country where newspapers try to frighten us with everything they can come up with might have it's effect...     Anyway. Any other precautions other than DEET containing repellents? Is it not good to sleep with the window open at night in cities? Any places I should stay out off? (Can I visit pig farms or deep jungles of Yakushima for instance?) What do you think of the idea the doctor said a mosquito could come from a nearby pig farm and bite me, is it just... "bogus" so to say?     I will buy one repellent over here in Sweden but would you think it will be a problem if the Japanese customs search my bag and find it? (Might have to put it in on board bag since I dont know how it will react to the lower temp). I am pretty sure it doesnt contain any pseudo.... whatever it is called that is fobidden in Japan.     A bit off topic but Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended when traveling in countries like Greece , Spain , etc, would it be nessicary in Japan?     By the way, thank you for your replies.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to the severity of the disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.   The popular movie “Chicken Run” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp—like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances of us getting out of here are a million to one.” To which Ginger replies, “Then there's still a chance.” The chance of a traveler contracting symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral disease carried by mosquitoes exclusively in Asia, is also ∼1,000,000 to 1 [ 1 ]. Although many travel medicine practitioners may be reassured by this figure that the risk of JE to travelers is minimal, others may believe, as Ginger did, that there is still a chance that a traveler will contract the disease. JE is a disease that pushes the limits of understanding risk and risk avoidance among travelers. The risk of falling ill with JE while traveling in Asia is 10 times less than the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis in the general population of Americans, who do not opt for immunization to prevent that disease [ 2 ]. However, many medical practitioners correctly point out that JE is a potentially severe disease for which there is no available treatment. The associated mortality rate is 30%–40%, and 50% of those who survive have permanent neuropsychiatric problems [ 3 ]. Thus, the prevention of JE presents a dichotomy: an extremely low risk of contracting disease versus a very serious and untreatable illness. JE is endemic throughout Asia. Yet despite this widespread potential risk, the actual risk to most travelers remains low. Although the disease is preventable by a vaccine that has been available for µ50 years, the vaccine has been associated with rare adverse effects that have made some travel medicine practitioners cautious about when to recommend its use. In 1993, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations regarding vaccination against JE, which were widely circulated. However their implementation has been controversial; some practitioners believe that the vaccine is being overused, and others believe that it should be used more widely [ 4 ]. The purpose of this review is to assess the known risks to a traveler or expatriate of contracting JE, along with the risks that have been associated with the vaccine, and to try to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk.  Clinical Features of Je  Those who have actually seen and treated JE are much more inclined to recommend immunization than are those for whom it remains only a theoretical risk for their traveling patients. After 5–15 days of incubation and a few days of a seemingly innocuous febrile illness, which may include symptoms of headache, coryza, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea, patients develop features of neurological disease. These may include meningism, confusion, paralysis, parkinsonian movement disorders, abnormal posturing, seizures, and coma [ 5 ]. A proportion of patients with JE have an acute flaccid paralysis that is easily mistaken for poliomyelitis [ 6 ], but the majority present with a reduced level of consciousness, often heralded by generalized convulsions. If not controlled, these convulsions rapidly lead to status epilepticus. Signs of brain stem damage caused either directly by viral invasion or indirectly by increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation are also common. Approximately one-third of patients with JE die, and approximately half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae.  Epidemiology  JE virus is a flavivirus antigenically related to West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. Dengue and yellow fever are also caused by flaviviruses [ 7 ]. JE virus is spread mainly by Culex mosquitoes, of which Culex tritaeniorhyncus is the principal vector in most of Asia. This is an ornithophilic (bird-biting) mosquito that also feeds on other animals and humans. It feeds at night, seeks blood meals mainly outdoors, feeds repeatedly during a brief life span, and disperses widely after a blood meal [ 8 ]. It breeds in rural areas (e.g., rice paddies and ditches) where birds are found but is also found on the edges of cities. Epidemics of JE were described in Japan in the 1870s, and the virus was first isolated in 1935. In the first half of the 20th century, the disease was noted to occur mainly in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Russia, and Japan. In the second half of the century, the disease was recognized in an expanding pattern throughout all of Asia and as far south as the northern tip of Australia [ 9 ]. Broadly speaking, 2 epidemiological patterns of JE are recognized. In northern temperate areas (Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, northern Vietnam, northern Thailand, Nepal, and northern India), large epidemics occur during the summer months (roughly, May to October). Tables showing more specific data on risk by month for each country are available from several sources [ 1 , 10 , 11 ]. In southern tropical areas (southern Vietnam, southern Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and southern India), JE tends to be endemic; here, cases occur sporadically throughout the year, with a peak after the start of the rainy season [ 12 ]. Serological studies have shown that in parts of rural Asia where JE is endemic, almost all of the human population has been infected with JE virus by early adulthood [ 13 ]. Only a small proportion (estimated at between 1 per 250 and 1 per 1000 infected persons) develop symptomatic disease. In areas of endemicity, one-half of all cases occur in children <4 years old, and nearly all cases occur in children <10 years old. When immunologically naive adults are exposed to JE virus, they are as susceptible as children are. Thus, when JE virus caused new epidemics in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, adults developed the disease [ 13 ]. The susceptibility of immunologically naive adults was also demonstrated by the incidence of JE among American troops during conflicts in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam [ 14–18 ]. Among American service personnel in Korea, 1 in 25 infections caused symptoms [ 19 ]. The death rate among children in countries in which JE is endemic is high enough to warrant programs of mass immunization in the countries that can afford it. However, because animals, rather than humans, are the natural hosts, mass immunization cannot cut the risk of disease to those who are not immunized. Thus, the risk to tourists is no different in countries with routine JE immunization for children.  Epidemiology Among Travelers  The CDC reviewed cases of JE among expatriates and travelers that occurred during 1978–1992 [ 1 ]. They described 24 cases: outcome information was available for 15 patients, of whom 6 died, 5 were listed as disabled, and 4 recovered. Only 1 or 2 of these 24 patients were tourists; the other patients were doing research or medical relief work or were soldiers on maneuvers. Comparisons of disease risk among travelers is hampered because rates of immunization are unknown. However, only 8 cases of yellow fever were reported in travelers between 1979 and 1996, of which 5 were fatal [ 20 ]. The CDC concluded that the overall risk of JE for travelers to areas where JE is endemic was <1 case per 1,000,000 travelers. However, they noted that “short-term travelers to developed and urban areas” may have accounted for most of the denominator. When they tried to estimate the risk of JE for travelers actually spending time in rural destinations during the season of risk, they came up with a very rough range of 1 case per 5000 to 1 case per 20,000 travelers per week [ 1 ]. Studies have helped to define why the risk is low for short-term travelers to areas of endemicity. JE is transmitted only by specific vector mosquitoes. Even where the disease is hyperendemic, the infection rate among mosquitoes does not exceed 3%. Even when a bite by an infected mosquito results in human infection, symptomatic neuroinvasive illness occurs in <1/250 cases of infection, although its frequency may be higher among foreigners than among local people [ 21 ]. If Culex mosquitoes accounted for 10% of mosquitoes in a given area of hyperendemicity, the chance that a single mosquito bite would transmit the virus and result in symptomatic JE would be ∼1 in 10,000. These factors may help account for the apparent low risk for short-term tourists. However, the rare cases of JE that have occurred in tourists have shown the limitations in our understanding of the risk factors. Two foreigners staying in hotels in Bali, Indonesia, developed JE in 1994–1995: a nonfatal case occurred in March 1994 in a Swedish woman [ 22 ], and a fatal case occurred in January 1995 in a Danish man [ 23 ]. The annual number of non-Asian tourists visiting Bali during this time was ∼450,000 [ 24 ]. The only other reported case from Bali occurred in an Australian tourist in 1989 [ 25 ]. There have been no reported cases among tourists in Bali since 1995. The epidemiology of JE in Nepal highlights some of the difficulties in making sound recommendations to travelers. The disease was first recognized in Nepal in 1978 [ 26 ]. Since then, it has been shown to be hyperendemic in the Terai region, with seasonal outbreaks annually affecting thousands of people. Foreign expatriates who reside in the Terai, mainly to do aid work or research, have been immunized against JE since the early 1980s. Tourists to Nepal who visit Kathmandu and go trekking were not thought to be at risk, nor were short-term visitors to the Terai. However, in 1995, 2 cases of indigenous JE among Nepalese in the Kathmandu Valley were documented at 1 hospital [ 27 ], and in 1996–1998, 12 more cases were confirmed [ 28 ]. In addition, a serosurvey of pigs in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 23 of 44 pigs were positive for antibodies to JE virus [ 27 ]. Amid all of this JE activity, not a single foreigner in Nepal has had the disease diagnosed. Because of the recently documented risk of JE in Kathmandu Valley, long-term expatriates are now opting for JE immunization, but no national public health body has yet recommended immunization for tourists visiting Kathmandu. The difference between 0 and 1 as the numerator of risk is highlighted by the case of an Israeli traveler who developed JE while traveling in Thailand in 1989. She survived a stormy clinical course, but her single case led the Israeli public health authorities to recommend JE vaccine for all Israeli travelers to Thailand.  Je Vaccines  Three JE vaccines are currently available worldwide, of which only the inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine (manufactured by Biken) is in use commercially for travelers. The inactivated mouse brain—derived vaccine was developed in Russia and Japan in the 1930s but became a priority for the US military during World War II. After the war, further vaccine development took place in Japan. The People's Republic of China uses an inactivated hamster kidney cell—derived vaccine as its main vaccine against JE for children, and µ70 million doses are distributed annually. China also has developed a live attenuated JE vaccine, which is safe and effective and has been widely used [ 24 , 29 ]. Only 1 case-control study has measured the efficacy of the Biken vaccine. Hoke et al. [ 30 ] immunized 43,708 Thai children with JE vaccine and administered tetanus toxoid vaccine to another 21,516 children, who served as a control group. Protective efficacy in the JE vaccine group was 91%, and the group receiving JE vaccine also showed a trend toward fewer and less severe cases of dengue fever [ 30 ].  Dosage and Administration of Je Vaccine  The recommended schedule for administration of the Biken JE vaccine is 1 dose on each of days 0, 7, and 30 [ 1 ]. This schedule achieves a seroconversion rate of virtually 100%. An accelerated schedule, given on days 0, 7, and 14, can be used when time is short. The accelerated schedule achieves seroconversion rates of nearly 100%, but the overall titer of antibody that is reached is lower. Two doses of JE vaccine produce only an 80% chance of seroconversion [ 31–33 ]. The question of when to administer a booster vaccination after the initial series has not been satisfactorily resolved. A study of US Army soldiers found that antibody titers at 12 months after vaccination did not differ from those determined at 3 months. Three years after the primary series, 16 (94%) of 17 soldiers retained an adequate neutralizing antibody titer. It is commonly recommended that a booster be administered 2 or 3 years after the initial immunization for persons who remain at risk for JE virus infection. Beyond the first booster vaccination, no studies are available to guide recommendations. At that point, the travel medicine practitioner has the choice of recommending another booster after 3 years or measuring serum antibodies to guide further decisions about when to administer a booster. A neutralizing antibody titer of µ1 : 10 is generally accepted as evidence of protection [ 21 ]. Because of the possibility of delayed, but potentially serious, hypersensitivity reactions to JE vaccine (discussed in the next section), recipients of JE vaccine should remain where adequate medical care is available for up to 10 days after they receive the last dose [ 1 ]. However, given that there have been no fatal anaphylactic reactions to JE vaccine, the risk of JE might lead to a decision to immunize travelers even if they must depart <10 days after they receive the last dose.  Adverse Reactions to Je Vaccine  The Biken JE vaccine had been used for years, and millions of doses had been administered to Asian populations, before it began to be given to travelers to and expatriates in Asia. Severe adverse events were extremely rare; surveillance of JE vaccine recipients over an 8-year period in Japan (1965–1973) detected severe neurological reactions at a rate of 1–2.3 cases per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients. With more widespread use in travelers, however, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions began to be reported. The first set of adverse reaction reports were reported from Denmark, Australia, and Canada [ 34–36 ]. These reports described urticaria and angioedema that occasionally involved the face and lips. Respiratory distress was reported in 3 vaccine recipients. Of concern to travel medicine practitioners was the observation that the reactions were often delayed by several days to, possibly, 2 weeks, which meant that some reactions could occur in recipients of the vaccine who had already begun their travels. However, it should be noted that anaphylaxis—and the consequent risk of sudden death—has never been reported in relation to the administration of Biken JE vaccine. Surveillance of JE vaccine reactions in Denmark showed that mucocutaneous reactions occurred in 73 recipients between 1983 and 1995, corresponding to a rate of 1–17 cases per 10,000 vaccine recipients [ 37 ]. The investigators noted, however, that the majority of—but not all—cases were clustered in the period 1989–1992, around the time that the first similar reactions were reported in other centers. Three batches of vaccine were implicated as having caused the highest number of reactions, but reactions have not been limited to persons who received vaccine from these batches. Investigation of the batches found no obvious clue as to why they may have been more reactogenic. The same investigators in Denmark have also produced a report detailing possible severe neurological reactions to JE vaccine [ 38 ]. Between 1983 and 1995 in Denmark, 10 persons who were vaccinated with JE vaccine were followed up because they had various neurological syndromes that were temporally related to vaccination (i.e., 0.1–2.3/10,000 vaccine recipients). These reactions included encephalopathy, paresthesias, leg weakness, headache, and ataxia. The wide variety of reactions, the lack of a control group, and the fact that the onset of symptoms occurred 1–27 days after vaccination make it difficult to know whether some of these observations were coincidental. No further cases of severe neurological reaction have been reported from Denmark since the 1995 case, despite continued surveillance. Among the mucocutaneous reactions, 2 different syndromes were noted in a study from Japan: a syndrome involving urticaria and wheezing, which was associated with measurable IgE antibodies to gelatin in serum samples, and a syndrome consisting of hypotension and cyanosis, which was not associated with antigelatin antibodies [ 39 ]. Small amounts of gelatin are used as a stabilizer in the Biken vaccine. Other studies have found that prior history of urticaria or allergy to bee venom were separate risk factors for an increased chance of allergic reaction to JE vaccine [ 1 , 40 ]. An Australian study noted that excessive alcohol intake after JE immunization was statistically associated with an increased chance of allergic reaction [ 41 ]. Only 1 fatality was noted during surveillance of µ10,000,000 doses of JE vaccine administered in Japan and the United States. A 3-year-old boy developed fever, cerebral edema, and coma 2 days after JE vaccination and died within 4 days of vaccination [ 42 ]. Surveillance of 813,000 doses distributed in the United States between 1993 and 1998 found that the rate of all adverse events was 15 events per 100,000 doses, and the rate of urticaria or angioedema was 6.3 cases per 100,000 doses. No adverse neurological events were noted by use of passive surveillance. Of note is the unexplained observation that the rates of adverse events were 3 times higher in the first year of the study in 1993. In summary, detailed studies in America, Japan, and Europe have shown that severe adverse events following JE vaccination are extremely rare and that milder events are more common, but both occur at rates considered acceptable for many other vaccines. The persistent impression that JE vaccine is associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions probably stems from the first years of its introduction into travel clinics, when the rate of adverse reactions actually was higher than it is at present.  Je Vaccination Recommendations  The conventional advice on recommending JE immunization for travelers is to focus on those travelers who will spend ⩾30 days in an environment in which JE is endemic, or less time if they are visiting areas experiencing epidemic transmission [ 1 ]. This duration of travel in a single area also selects for those travelers who will likely venture away from the usual tourist paths. However, use of an arbitrary duration-of-travel cutoff cannot protect all travelers who will be at risk. Knowledge of the purpose of the trip and the risk for a given area could result in a desire to immunize someone who will be in a village for only a few days. The risk of JE has clearly been associated with nighttime visits to rice-growing areas. Travelers for whom JE immunization should be considered include the following: persons who will be spending time living in a village setting near rice paddies and farm animals during a season of transmission; soldiers who will be on maneuvers in an area of endemicity during the season of risk, which can be year-round in the tropics; aid workers, missionaries, students, and researchers whose work will involve spending time in an area of endemicity during the season of risk; bicyclists, backpackers, and other adventure travelers whose itinerary is uncertain but may include significant time in areas of endemicity; expatriates taking up residence in a country in which JE is endemic, even if they will not reside in a high-risk area (frequent travel to rural areas may result in cumulative exposure over time); and travelers who request the vaccine after the risk of JE has been discussed, even if the travel medicine practitioner feels the risk is low. Because a theoretical—and occasionally unpredictable—risk exists in all Asian countries, the travel medicine practitioner should not be dogmatic in refusing to give JE vaccine when it is requested. Given the low risk of transmission from a single mosquito bite, the use of appropriate clothing, insecticides, bed netting, and insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) can dramatically lower the chances of falling ill with JE. Because the vaccine is not 100% protective, travelers to areas of high endemicity will also want to practice these preventive measures, which will decrease the chances of acquiring malaria and dengue fever as well.  Conclusions  The difficulties in knowing when to recommend JE vaccine will persist. The very low statistical risk suggests that most travelers are not at risk on typical tourist or business itineraries to Asia. A blanket recommendation that all travelers to Asia be immunized against JE would vastly overprotect those who will not truly be at risk and will increase the number of rare adverse reactions to the vaccine. The unsettling concern is what to do about visitors to areas where a risk to foreigners has very rarely occurred or theoretically could exist. An example of the former includes the island of Bali, where 3 cases of JE in travelers have been documented during a 13-year period, and where the risk of JE may have been underestimated. An example of the latter is the Kathmandu Valley, where indigenous transmission has recently been documented among Nepalese farmers just outside the metropolitan area of Kathmandu. Because the incidence of JE is on the rise throughout Asia, because epidemics are usually detected only after they have occurred, and because there are regions where endemic disease may go largely unnoticed, travelers may rarely find themselves exposed in an area that is currently thought to carry minimal risk. By fine-tuning travel advice to select the subgroup of travelers at greatest risk, travel medicine practitioners can probably fulfill their goal of protecting travelers from a severe, untreatable disease. Safer vaccines, if they reach market, may further lower the threshold for recommendation of the vaccine more widely [ 43 ]. No matter how carefully we evaluate each traveler's itinerary, the fact remains that a risk of 1,000,000 to 1 means that there is still a chance of getting the disease. When a case of JE does occur, it is likely to seem unexpected and tragic, but lawyers may argue that it was predictable and preventable. Travel medicine has not been successful in finding a common interpretation of acceptable risk. A study determined that the risk of dying while trekking in Nepal was 15 deaths per 100,000 trekkers [ 44 ]; one reviewer insisted that the authors of that report must conclude from these numbers that trekking is a high-risk activity, whereas another reviewer insisted that the author must conclude—from the same data—that trekking is relatively safe.

Hills, Ingrid B. Rabe, Marc Fischer  INFECTIOUS AGENT  Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus and is closely related to West Nile and Saint Louis encephalitis viruses.  TRANSMISSION  JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily Culex species. The virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and amplifying vertebrate hosts, primarily pigs and wading birds. Humans are incidental or dead-end hosts, because they usually do not develop a level or duration of viremia sufficient to infect mosquitoes.  EPIDEMIOLOGY  JE virus is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis in Asia, occurring throughout most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific ( Map 3-08 ). Local transmission of JE virus has not been detected in Africa, Europe, or the Americas. Transmission principally occurs in rural agricultural areas, often associated with rice cultivation and flood irrigation. In some areas of Asia, these ecologic conditions may occur near, or occasionally within, urban centers. In temperate areas of Asia, transmission is seasonal, and human disease usually peaks in summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, seasonal transmission varies with monsoon rains and irrigation practices and may be prolonged or even occur year-round.  In endemic countries, where adults have acquired immunity through natural infection, JE is primarily a disease of children. However, travel-associated JE can occur among people of any age. For most travelers to Asia, the risk for JE is extremely low but varies based on destination, duration, season, and activities.  From 1973 through 2015, 79 JE cases among travelers or expatriates from nonendemic countries were published or reported to CDC. From the time a JE vaccine became available in the United States in 1993, through 2015, only 10 JE cases among US travelers were reported to CDC.  The overall incidence of JE among people from nonendemic countries traveling to Asia is estimated to be <1 case per 1 million travelers. However, expatriates and travelers who stay for prolonged periods in rural areas with active JE virus transmission are likely at similar risk as the susceptible resident population (5–50 cases per 100,000 children per year). Travelers on even brief trips might be at increased risk if they have extensive outdoor or nighttime exposure in rural areas during periods of active transmission. Short-term (<1 month) travelers whose visits are restricted to major urban areas are at minimal risk for JE. In some endemic areas, although there are few human cases among residents because of natural immunity among older people or vaccination, JE virus is still maintained locally in an enzootic cycle between animals and mosquitoes. Therefore, susceptible visitors may be at risk for infection.     Map 3-08. Distribution of Japanese encephalitis   PDF Version (printable)     CLINICAL PRESENTATION  Most human infections with JE virus are asymptomatic; <1% of people infected with JE virus develop clinical disease. Acute encephalitis is the most commonly recognized clinical manifestation of JE virus infection. Milder forms of disease, such as aseptic meningitis or undifferentiated febrile illness, can also occur. The incubation period is 5– 15 days. Illness usually begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting. Mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits, generalized weakness, and movement disorders may develop over the next few days. The classical description of JE includes a parkinsonian syndrome with mask-like facies, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and choreoathetoid movements. Acute flaccid paralysis, with clinical and pathological features similar to those of poliomyelitis, has also been associated with JE virus infection. Seizures are common, especially among children. The case-fatality ratio is approximately 20%–30%. Among survivors, 30%–50% have serious neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric sequelae.  Common clinical laboratory findings include moderate leukocytosis, mild anemia, and hyponatremia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically has a mild to moderate pleocytosis with a lymphocytic predominance, slightly elevated protein, and normal ratio of CSF to plasma glucose.  DIAGNOSIS  JE should be suspected in a patient with evidence of a neurologic infection (such as encephalitis, meningitis, or acute flaccid paralysis) who has recently traveled to or resided in an endemic country in Asia or the western Pacific. Laboratory diagnosis of JE virus infection should be performed by using a JE virus–specific IgM-capture ELISA on CSF or serum. JE virus–specific IgM can be measured in the CSF of most patients by 4 days after onset of symptoms and in serum by 7 days after onset. Plaque reduction neutralization tests can be performed to confirm the presence of JE virus–specific neutralizing antibodies and discriminate between cross-reacting antibodies from closely related flaviviruses (such as dengue and West Nile viruses). A ≥4-fold rise in JE virus– specific neutralizing antibodies between acute-and convalescent-phase serum specimens may be used to confirm recent infection. Vaccination history, date of onset of symptoms, and information regarding other flaviviruses known to circulate in the geographic area that may cross-react in serologic assays need to be considered when interpreting results.  Humans have low levels of transient viremia and usually have neutralizing antibodies by the time distinctive clinical symptoms are recognized. Virus isolation and nucleic-acid amplification tests are insensitive in detecting JE virus or viral RNA in blood or CSF and should not be used for ruling out a diagnosis of JE. Clinicians should contact their state or local health department or CDC at 970-221-6400 for assistance with diagnostic testing.  TREATMENT  There is no specific antiviral treatment for JE; therapy consists of supportive care and management of complications.  PREVENTION  Personal Protection Measures  The best way to prevent mosquitoborne diseases, including JE, is to avoid mosquito bites (see Chapter 2, Protection against Mosquitoes, Ticks, & Other Arthropods ).  Vaccine  One JE vaccine is licensed and available in the United States—an inactivated Vero cell culture– derived vaccine, Ixiaro ( Table 3-06 ). Ixiaro is manufactured by Valneva Scotland Limited and distributed in the United States by VaxServe (a Sanofi Pasteur company). It was approved in March 2009 for use in people aged ≥17 years and in May 2013 for use in children aged 2 months through 16 years. Other inactivated and live attenuated JE vaccines are manufactured and used in other countries but are not licensed for use in the United States.  INDICATIONS FOR USE OF JE VACCINE FOR TRAVELERS  When making recommendations regarding the use of JE vaccine for travelers, clinicians must weigh the overall low risk of travel-associated JE, the high rate of death and disability when JE occurs, the low probability of serious adverse events after immunization, and the cost of the vaccine. Evaluation of a traveler’s risk should take into account the planned itinerary, including travel location, duration, activities, and seasonal patterns of disease in the areas to be visited ( Table 3-07 ). The data in the table should be interpreted cautiously, because JE virus transmission activity varies within countries and from year to year.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends JE vaccine for travelers who plan to spend ≥1 month in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. This includes long-term travelers, recurrent travelers, or expatriates who will be based in urban areas but are likely to visit endemic rural or agricultural areas during a high-risk period of JE virus transmission. Vaccine should also be considered for the following:   Short-term (<1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of JE virus exposure. Examples of higher-risk activities or itineraries include 1) spending substantial time outdoors in rural or agricultural areas, especially during the evening or night; 2) participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming); and 3) staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.  Travelers to an area with an ongoing JE outbreak.  Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific destinations, activities, or duration of travel.   JE vaccine is not recommended for short-term travelers whose visits will be restricted to urban areas or times outside a well-defined JE virus transmission season.  VACCINE EFFICACY AND IMMUNOGENICITY  There are no efficacy data for Ixiaro. The vaccine was licensed in the United States on the basis of its ability to induce JE virus neutralizing antibodies as a surrogate for protection, as well as safety evaluations in almost 5,000 adults. In pivotal immunogenicity studies, 96% of adults and 100% of children aged 2 months through 17 years developed protective neutralizing antibodies at 28 days after receiving a primary immunization series of 2 doses administered 28 days apart. Among adults aged ≥65 years, 65% are seroprotected at 42 days after the 2-dose primary series.  A study in adults on persistence of protective neutralizing antibodies after a primary 2-dose series of Ixiaro showed that at 5 years postvaccination, 82% of subjects were seroprotected. However, the study was conducted in areas where tickborne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine is available. In a subgroup analysis, seroprotection rates at 24– 60 months in the TBE vaccine group ranged from 94%–100%, compared with 64%–72% in the group in which TBE vaccine was not administered. TBE vaccine is not available in the United States; therefore, JE seroprotection rates for US travelers are likely to be most similar to the rates in the group not administered TBE vaccine.  One observational study investigated long-term protection following a booster dose of Ixiaro in adults. After a booster dose administered at 15 months, 96% of subjects were still seroprotected approximately 6 years later.  There are limited data on duration of seroprotection and need for a booster dose in children. In a study conducted among children from non-endemic countries, 89% were seroprotected at 3 years after a primary 2-dose series of Ixiaro. This rate was higher than that in a comparative adult study. In a study conducted among children in a JE-endemic country, 90% of children were seroprotected at 36 months after the primary series. Seroprotection rates were variable by age group, but at least 81% of children in each age group were seroprotected.  An accelerated primary series of 2 doses of Ixiaro administered 7 days apart has been studied in adults aged 18–65 years. In the accelerated schedule group, 99% of adults were seroprotected, compared with 100% of adults in the standard schedule group. The accelerated primary series was noninferior to the conventional dosing schedule. An accelerated schedule (administered on days 0 and 7) has been licensed for use in Europe.  VACCINE ADMINISTRATION  The primary immunization schedule for Ixiaro is 2 doses administered intramuscularly on days 0 and 28 (Table 3-6). For children aged 2 months through 2 years, each dose is 0.25 mL, and for adults and children aged ≥3 years, each dose is 0.5 mL. To administer a 0.25-mL dose, health care providers must expel and discard half of the volume from the 0.5-mL prefilled syringe by pushing the plunger stopper up to the edge of the red line on the syringe barrel before injection. The 2-dose series should be completed ≥1 week before travel.  BOOSTER DOSES  For adults, if the primary series of Ixiaro was administered >1 year previously, a booster dose should be given before potential reexposure or if there is a continued risk for JE virus infection. Data on the response to a booster dose administered ≥2 years after the primary series are not available.  There are limited data on the use of Ixiaro as a booster dose after a primary series with the mouse brain–derived inactivated JE vaccine. Two studies have been conducted, 1 in US military personnel and the other at 2 travel clinics in Europe. Both studies demonstrated that in adults who had previously received at least a primary series of mouse brain–derived inactivated JE vaccine, a single dose of Ixiaro adequately boosted neutralizing antibody levels and provided at least short-term protection. In addition, seroprotective titers against both vaccine virus strains persisted in all participants who could be followed up at 2 years in the European study (N = 18). However, additional data are needed on the duration of protection after a single dose of Ixiaro in prior recipients of a mouse brain–derived vaccine. Until those data are available, people who have received JEVax, the mouse brain–derived vaccine formerly used in the United States, and require further vaccination against JE virus, should receive a 2-dose primary series of Ixiaro.  VACCINE SAFETY AND ADVERSE REACTIONS  Local symptoms of pain and tenderness were the most commonly reported symptoms in a safety study with 1,993 adult participants who received 2 doses of Ixiaro. Headache, myalgia, fatigue, and an influenzalike illness were each reported at a rate of >10%. In children, fever was the most commonly reported systemic reaction in studies.  PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS  A severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of Ixiaro or any other JE vaccine, or to any component of Ixiaro, is a contraindication to administration of Ixiaro. Ixiaro contains protamine sulfate, a compound known to cause hypersensitivity reactions in some people. No studies of Ixiaro in pregnant women have been conducted. Therefore, administration of Ixiaro to pregnant women usually should be deferred. However, pregnant women who must travel to an area where risk for JE virus infection is high should be vaccinated when the theoretical risk of immunization is outweighed by the risk of infection.

I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?      What is Japanese encephalitis?  Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a potentially severe disease. JE is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes in Asia and the western Pacific. JE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).  Where does Japanese encephalitis occur?  JE occurs in Asia and parts of the western Pacific. It usually occurs in rural or agricultural areas, often associated with rice farming. In temperate areas of Asia, transmission is seasonal, and human disease usually peaks in the summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.  How soon do people get sick after being bitten by an infected mosquito?  It takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms.   Top of Page  What are the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis?  Most people who are infected develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, initial symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. The disease can progress to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and is often accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis occur in some cases.   Top of Page  How is Japanese encephalitis diagnosed?  Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory tests of blood or spinal fluid. These tests typically detect antibodies that the immune system makes against the viral infection.   Top of Page  What is the treatment for Japanese encephalitis?  There is no specific treatment. Severe illnesses are treated by supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, and intravenous fluids.   Top of Page  What should I do if I think a family member might have Japanese encephalitis?  Consult a healthcare provider for evaluation and diagnosis.   Top of Page  How can people reduce the chance of getting infected?   Use insect repellent and wear long pants and sleeves  Sleep in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms or use bed nets  A vaccine against JE virus is available. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether this vaccine is right for you.    Top of Page  Who should get Japanese encephalitis vaccine?  JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend at least 1 month in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. Vaccine should also be considered for the following:   Short-term (less than 1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of exposure. Higher-risk activities include participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming) and staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.  Travelers to an area with an ongoing outbreak.  Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific travel destinations, activities, or duration.    Top of Page  How long does the Japanese encephalitis vaccination last?  The duration of protection is unknown. For persons aged 17 years and older, a booster dose may be given if the primary two-dose vaccination series was given one year or more previously and there is continued risk of exposure. Although studies are being conducted on the need for a booster dose for children, data are not yet available.   Top of Page  What are the side effects of Japanese encephalitis vaccination?  Pain and tenderness are the most commonly reported symptoms. Headache, muscle pain and fatigue can also occur.   Top of Page  I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?

I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?      What is Japanese encephalitis?  Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a potentially severe disease. JE is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes in Asia and the western Pacific. JE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).  Where does Japanese encephalitis occur?  JE occurs in Asia and parts of the western Pacific. It usually occurs in rural or agricultural areas, often associated with rice farming. In temperate areas of Asia, transmission is seasonal, and human disease usually peaks in the summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.  How soon do people get sick after being bitten by an infected mosquito?  It takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms.   Top of Page  What are the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis?  Most people who are infected develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, initial symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. The disease can progress to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and is often accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis occur in some cases.   Top of Page  How is Japanese encephalitis diagnosed?  Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory tests of blood or spinal fluid. These tests typically detect antibodies that the immune system makes against the viral infection.   Top of Page  What is the treatment for Japanese encephalitis?  There is no specific treatment. Severe illnesses are treated by supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, and intravenous fluids.   Top of Page  What should I do if I think a family member might have Japanese encephalitis?  Consult a healthcare provider for evaluation and diagnosis.   Top of Page  How can people reduce the chance of getting infected?   Use insect repellent and wear long pants and sleeves  Sleep in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms or use bed nets  A vaccine against JE virus is available. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether this vaccine is right for you.    Top of Page  Who should get Japanese encephalitis vaccine?  JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend at least 1 month in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. Vaccine should also be considered for the following:   Short-term (less than 1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of exposure. Higher-risk activities include participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming) and staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.  Travelers to an area with an ongoing outbreak.  Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific travel destinations, activities, or duration.    Top of Page  How long does the Japanese encephalitis vaccination last?  The duration of protection is unknown. For persons aged 17 years and older, a booster dose may be given if the primary two-dose vaccination series was given one year or more previously and there is continued risk of exposure. Although studies are being conducted on the need for a booster dose for children, data are not yet available.   Top of Page  What are the side effects of Japanese encephalitis vaccination?  Pain and tenderness are the most commonly reported symptoms. Headache, muscle pain and fatigue can also occur.   Top of Page  I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?  Consult with your healthcare provider. Ask your healthcare provider to report your case to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) if he or she thinks the vaccine has made you sick.

Japanese encephalitis is one of the many mosquito-borne diseases you might hear mentioned as you prepare for your trip. Potentially, it's more lethal than dengue and Chikungunya, the better known, but (generally) more benign diseases spread by mozzies in tropical and sub-tropical regions.  In fact, in terms of potential severity, Japanese encephalitis (or JE as it is known) ranks closer to yellow fever or malaria, but with far fewer cases – particularly among travellers.  There have been only 62 documented travel-related cases of JE in the past 40 years, although an estimated 30,000-50,000 people living in the rural rice-growing, pig-farming areas where the disease typically occurs are infected each year.  That makes JE a rare event among travellers. But, 'rare' does not mean 'never', as 2 recent worrying cases involving travellers show.  Two unusual recent cases They're worrying because their separate itineraries did not fit the usual criteria for recommending JE vaccination. Both patients were healthy young men who spent only a short time in Thailand and had no exposure (as far as we know) in the higher-risk rice-growing areas. CASE 1 – A 20-year-old Spaniard who travelled to Thailand for a martial arts competition in March this year enjoyed a very common itinerary in popular areas of Thailand. It began with 2 days in a Bangkok hotel, followed by stays in bungalows on two beaches (Chaweng and Lamai) on Koh Samui Island. He visited rural areas, including a forest and waterfalls, where he recalls receiving mosquito bites. Four months later, including a 2-month stay in hospital, the previously healthy young sportsman is able to walk again, if unsteadily, but has memory loss. His case was described in a Eurosurveillance report . CASE 2 – A Chinese man, also aged 20, became ill with a fever in Thailand in late August after a 3-week stay. Fortunately, was able to return home and is in a stable condition undergoing treatment in hospital in Hong Kong. It is not yet known where he stayed or the places he visited while in Thailand. (Hong Kong has now seen 2 'imported' and 4 locally acquired cases in the past two years.) Source : The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) – Hong Kong. Which travellers are most at risk? Travellers considered to be most at risk of JE in Asia are those who are: - staying longer than month, especially in rural areas during the local JE transmission season. - Working or studying in ANY areas of a country where JE is common (endemic) for an extended period. - visiting an area with an ongoing JE outbreak. - uncertain of specific destinations, activities, or duration of travel in an endemic area. Typically, JE vaccination is recommended for backpackers passing through regional areas, rural-based aid workers, and expats living or working in an endemic region. However, because travellers have been infected after shorter periods of travel, the Australian Immunisation Handbook recommends that doctors consider advising vaccination if: – Travel is taking place during the wet season, and/or there is considerable outdoor activity, and/or the accommodation may not be mosquito-proof. – The traveller is spending a year or more in Asia (except Singapore) – even if much of their time will be spent in urban areas, and – The itinerary includes a month or more in Papua New Guinea, particularly during the wet season. Rare risk of severe illness These young men were doubly unlucky: Firstly, to get JE and, secondly, to develop a severe illness. For most of those infected, there are no symptoms or they're mild and self-limiting. But, for the less than 1% whose infection is severe, the statistics tell us that 20-30% will die and 30% - 50% will suffer a severe disability. In short, JE is a travel disease with a relatively low risk, but with potentially severe consequences. There are two excellent vaccines against Japanese encephalitis that should be considered by all travellers visiting Thailand and other risk areas of Asia, especially those expecting to get off the beaten track. Discuss your plans and detailed itinerary with your doctor, ideally one experienced in travel medicine. - Dr Eddy Bajrovic, Medical Director, Travelvax Australia. More about Japanese encephalitis About the virus – Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) closely related to the West Nile, St Louis encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue fever viruses. The symptoms – The virus affects the brain. Most JE virus infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms. However, less than 1% of infections results in severe disease that starts with high fever and may progress to coma and death. How it's spread – JE is transmitted in an 'enzootic cycle'. That is, mosquitoes usually transmit the disease to people after biting infected animals - mainly pigs and wading birds - that serve as 'hosts' to the virus. There is no person-to-person transmission. Where it occurs – JE occurs across most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific, where an estimated 35,000- 50,000 cases occur each year. Most are among local people living in rice-producing areas of 3 main regions: China (June through October) and Korea (May-October); Indian subcontinent – India (May–October, especially northern states; year-round in some southern states), Bangladesh (May–October), Nepal (June-October), Sri Lanka (year-round; variable monsoon peaks), and Pakistan (unknown); Southeast Asia – Myanmar (May–October), Thailand (year-round; seasonal peaks May–October, especially in the north), Cambodia (May–October), Laos (June – September), Vietnam (year-round; seasonal peaks May–October, especially in the north), Malaysia (year-round transmission; peak Oct–Dec in Sarawak), Indonesia (year-round; peak season varies by island; Bali year-round), and the Philippines (unknown; probably year-round). (JE also occurs occasionally in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Eastern Russia, Guam, Saipan, and Brunei Darussalam during the wet and early dry seasons. More recently JE has become established in Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands, with the occasional case in Northern Australia.) How you can prevent JE CONSIDER VACCINATION For those travellers who feel they may be at risk or wish to have the additional protection of immunisation against JE, two vaccines are available to Australian travellers. Imojev – The newest vaccine is a single-dose vaccine suitable for adults and infants/children 12 months and older. It provides 94% protection after 14 days. Because the vaccine is new, a booster dose is not recommended at this stage. Jespect – 2 intramuscular doses a month apart. Although it is registered for use in Australia for persons 18 years and older, it is also suitable for infants/children 12 months and older, if the alternative vaccine Imojev is contraindicated. Information regarding boosting is limited, but a single booster dose may be recommended after 12 months, if the risk of exposure continues. Read more about these vaccines, the schedules, protection levels, and potential side effects. AVOID MOZZIE BITES In any tropical region, preventing insect bites is vital – especially as malaria, dengue fever, Chikungunya fever, and other insect-borne diseases are even more likely to be present. Here are some simple bite-prevention measures you can take: - Apply mosquito repellent containing an effective active ingredient, such as DEET, Picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus to all exposed skin when outdoors. - Wear protective clothing (loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and long pants). - If possible, staying indoors at twilight and after dark. - Sleep under a mosquito net impregnated with Permethrin or Deltamethrin (which are available from Travelvax clinics ), particularly if your accommodation does not have insect screens or air conditioning. - Use mosquito coils and knock-down aerosol insecticides, if needed.

Transmission   Pigs and various wild birds represent the natural reservoir of this virus, which is transmitted to new animal hosts and occasionally
humans by mosquitoes of the genus Culex .  Nature of the disease   Most infections in humans are asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, severity varies: mild infections are characterized by febrile
headache or aseptic meningitis followed by an uneventful recovery; severe cases have a rapid onset and progression with
headache, high fever and meningeal signs. Permanent neurological sequelae are common among survivors. Approximately 25%
of severe clinical cases have a fatal outcome.  Geographical distribution   Japanese encephalitis virus is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and occurs in almost all Asian countries (see map).
Transmission occurs principally in rural agricultural locations where flooding irrigation is practised – some of which may be near
or within urban centres. Transmission is related mainly to the rainy season in south-east Asia but may take place all year round,
particularly in tropical climate zones. In the temperate regions of China, Japan, the Korean peninsula and eastern parts of the
Russian Federation, transmission occurs mainly during the summer and autumn.   Largely as a result of immunization, the incidence of Japanese encephalitis has been declining in Japan and the Republic of
Korea, in some regions of China, and more recently in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. However, transmission of the
virus remains unaffected by immunization, and non-immunized individuals remain at risk. The disease is also reported from
Bangladesh, parts of India and Pakistan, and from Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Philippines and other
countries in the region ( see map ).  Risk for travellers   The risk of Japanese encephalitis is very low for most travellers to Asia, particularly for short-term visitors to urban areas.
However, the risk varies according to season, destination, duration of travel and activities. Vaccination is recommended for
travellers with extensive outdoor exposure (camping, hiking, working, etc.) during the transmission season, particularly in
endemic countries or areas where flooding irrigation is practised. In areas at risk, Japanese encephalitis is primarily a disease of
children, but it can occur in travellers of any age. Prevention is by avoidance of mosquito bites (Chapter 3) and by vaccination.

JEV is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 68 000 clinical cases every year.  Although symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE) is rare, the case-fatality rate among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30%. Permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae can occur in 30%–50% of those with encephalitis.  24 countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions have endemic JEV transmission, exposing more than 3 billion people to risks of infection.  There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection.  Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent JE. WHO recommends that JE vaccination be integrated into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE disease is recognized as a public health issue.     Japanese encephalitis virus JEV is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and belongs to the same genus as dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses.   The first case of Japanese encephalitis viral disease (JE) was documented in 1871 in Japan.   The annual incidence of clinical disease varies both across and within endemic countries, ranging from <1 to >10 per 100 000 population or higher during outbreaks. A literature review estimates nearly 68 000 clinical cases of JE globally each year, with approximately 13 600 to 20 400 deaths. JE primarily affects children. Most adults in endemic countries have natural immunity after childhood infection, but individuals of any age may be affected.  Signs and symptoms   Most JEV infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately 1 in 250 infections results in severe clinical illness. Severe disease is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately death. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 30% among those with disease symptoms.   Of those who survive, 20%–30% suffer permanent intellectual, behavioural or neurological problems such as paralysis, recurrent seizures or the inability to speak.  Transmission   24 countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions have JEV transmission risk, which includes more than 3 billion people.   JEV is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the Culex species (mainly Culex tritaeniorhynchus ). Humans, once infected, do not develop sufficient viraemia to infect feeding mosquitoes. The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and/or water birds (enzootic cycle). The disease is predominantly found in rural and periurban settings, where humans live in closer proximity to these vertebrate hosts.   In most temperate areas of Asia, JEV is transmitted mainly during the warm season, when large epidemics can occur. In the tropics and subtropics, transmission can occur year-round but often intensifies during the rainy season and pre-harvest period in rice-cultivating regions.  Diagnosis   Individuals who live in or have travelled to a JE-endemic area and experience encephalitis are considered a suspected JE case. To confirm JEV infection and to rule out other causes of encephalitis requires a laboratory testing of serum or, preferentially, cerebrospinal fluid.   Surveillance of the disease is mostly syndromic for acute encephalitis. Confirmatory laboratory testing is often conducted in dedicated sentinel sites, and efforts are undertaken to expand laboratory-based surveillance. Case-based surveillance is established in countries that effectively control JE through vaccination.  Treatment   There is no antiviral treatment for patients with JE. Treatment is supportive to relieve symptoms and stabilize the patient.  Prevention and control   Safe and effective JE vaccines are available to prevent disease. WHO recommends having strong JE prevention and control activities, including JE immunization in all regions where the disease is a recognized public health priority, along with strengthening surveillance and reporting mechanisms. Even if the number of JE-confirmed cases is low, vaccination should be considered where there is a suitable environment for JE virus transmission. There is little evidence to support a reduction in JE disease burden from interventions other than the vaccination of humans.   There are 4 main types of JE vaccines currently in use: inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines, inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, and live recombinant vaccines.   Over the past years, the live attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine manufactured in China has become the most widely used vaccine in endemic countries, and it was prequalified by WHO in October 2013. Cell-culture based inactivated vaccines and the live recombinant vaccine based on the yellow fever vaccine strain have also been licensed and WHO-prequalified. In November 2013, Gavi opened a funding window to support JE vaccination campaigns in eligible countries.   All travellers to Japanese encephalitis-endemic areas should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites to reduce the risk for JE. Personal preventive measures include the use of repellents, long-sleeved clothes, coils and vaporizers. Travellers spending extensive time in JE endemic areas are recommended to get vaccinated.  Disease outbreaks   Major outbreaks of JE occur every 2-15 years. JE transmission intensifies during the rainy season, during which vector populations increase. However, there has not yet been evidence of increased JEV transmission following major floods or tsunamis. The spread of JEV in new areas has been correlated with agricultural development and intensive rice cultivation supported by irrigation programmes.   WHO responds to JE by:   providing global recommendations for JE control, including the use of vaccines. WHO recommends JE immunization in all regions where the disease is a recognized public health priority and supports implementation.  providing technical support for JE surveillance, JE vaccine introduction and large-scale JE vaccination campaigns, and evaluation of JE vaccine effectiveness and programmatic impact.

I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?      What is Japanese encephalitis?  Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a potentially severe disease. JE is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes in Asia and the western Pacific. JE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).  Where does Japanese encephalitis occur?  JE occurs in Asia and parts of the western Pacific. It usually occurs in rural or agricultural areas, often associated with rice farming. In temperate areas of Asia, transmission is seasonal, and human disease usually peaks in the summer and fall. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.  How soon do people get sick after being bitten by an infected mosquito?  It takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms.   Top of Page  What are the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis?  Most people who are infected develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, initial symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. The disease can progress to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and is often accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis occur in some cases.   Top of Page  How is Japanese encephalitis diagnosed?  Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory tests of blood or spinal fluid. These tests typically detect antibodies that the immune system makes against the viral infection.   Top of Page  What is the treatment for Japanese encephalitis?  There is no specific treatment. Severe illnesses are treated by supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, and intravenous fluids.   Top of Page  What should I do if I think a family member might have Japanese encephalitis?  Consult a healthcare provider for evaluation and diagnosis.   Top of Page  How can people reduce the chance of getting infected?   Use insect repellent and wear long pants and sleeves  Sleep in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms or use bed nets  A vaccine against JE virus is available. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether this vaccine is right for you.    Top of Page  Who should get Japanese encephalitis vaccine?  JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend at least 1 month in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. Vaccine should also be considered for the following:   Short-term (less than 1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of exposure. Higher-risk activities include participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming) and staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.  Travelers to an area with an ongoing outbreak.  Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific travel destinations, activities, or duration.    Top of Page  How long does the Japanese encephalitis vaccination last?  The duration of protection is unknown. For persons aged 17 years and older, a booster dose may be given if the primary two-dose vaccination series was given one year or more previously and there is continued risk of exposure. Although studies are being conducted on the need for a booster dose for children, data are not yet available.   Top of Page  What are the side effects of Japanese encephalitis vaccination?  Pain and tenderness are the most commonly reported symptoms. Headache, muscle pain and fatigue can also occur.   Top of Page  I think I got sick from the vaccine, what should I do?  Consult with your healthcare provider. Ask your healthcare provider to report your case to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) if he or she thinks the vaccine has made you sick.

25% of cases in which the brain is affected are fatal.  Travelers to South Korea should consider receiving the vaccination against Japanese encephalitis.  Children have a higher risk than adults of contracting Japanese encephalitis.  In a recent test conducted in the city of Busan, 64% of the mosquitoes that were examined tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. These findings prompted the Korea Centers for Disease Control to issue a nationwide alert.     A viral infection that is most commonly characterized by mild symptoms to no visible symptoms at all, Japanese encephalitis Japanese Encephalitis Risk to Travelers Risk of infection for those who will be traveling to areas that have reported cases of Japanese encephalitis is relatively low. Nevertheless, travelers are advised to take precautions, as infection may occur. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes that belong to the Culex species, namely Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Transmission most commonly occurs in rural agricultural parts of Asia, where rice production and regular flooding often take place. Transmission is seasonal in temperate parts of Asia with summer and fall being the times of year during which the highest number of human cases are reported. The disease may be transmitted at any time of the year in tropical and subtropical regions, though the number of cases may peak during the rainy season. Japanese Encephalitis in South Korea Travelers to South Korea, in particular, should consider receiving the vaccination against Japanese encephalitis. In a recent test that was conducted in the city of Busan, 64 percent of the mosquitoes that were examined tested positive for the disease. The results of the tests prompted the Korea Centers for Disease Control to issue a nationwide alert. Because mosquitoes in the area are most active until the end of October, people are advised to use mosquito nets and to limit their time spent outside during the warmer months. Researchers believe changes in climate are helping mosquitoes that are affected by the disease breed in ever greater numbers. Most Vulnerable Groups Children have a higher risk than adults of contracting Japanese encephalitis. In response to the perceived threat the disease may pose for children in the Korean peninsula, the global relief group Carnitas has vaccinated 430,000 children in the peninsula against the virus at the time of this writing. The group plans to vaccinate 2.3 million children against the disease by the end of 2013.

Feb 26, 2013, 11:14 AM      Will be going to Japan in May to mid-June. I am very unsure if I should or should not get this vaccine. Some doctors say if I am in the country more than 3 weeks it would be nessicary, others say if I am living in the woods, on farms etc more than three to four weeks then it would be nessicary....     Will be traveling across the country by train and air. Will stay only in big cities like Tokyo , Fukuoka , Sapporo etc...     Will probably visit forests or mountain ranges for sightseeing (like the national parks in Hokkaido, around Kagoshima volcano, in the southern Kyushuu peninsula, etc.) on day-trips, no sleeping in the woods or so.     The doctor frieghtened me that a mosquito could probably come and bite me after biting a pig with the disease even if I am in Tokyo. Some say it is not possible to protect myself from mosquitoes with bug spray or roll-ons, and wearing long shirt/pants seem very inconvenient in the summer.     So I am very clueless and soon it would be too late to take this vaccine since I will leave in almost 2 months. All these stories and stuff from doctors and others make me frightened to death a mosquito will come and bite me and then it would be the end of life. At the same time I am frightened the vaccine itself will give terrible side effects. It might be the old vaccine but rumor goes it could give encephalitis itself.

I had never heard of Japanese encephalitis until recently. I can't tell you what to do, but you can google and find that it is extremely rare in Japan today--fewer than 10 cases/year since the early '90s.

Re: Japanese encephalitis vaccine....   Feb 27, 2013, 2:01 AM      So even if I would visit the countryside for a daytrip should I be worried if I saw a mosquito bite later? Should I trust the doctor then a mosquito could fly from a pig farm to Tokyo and bite me, thinking like that would mean you could not even open the window or get off the plane at Narita at all.     I dont know why they say here if I stay in Japan more than three months it is good to get the vaccine. Could as well happen if i stay in just a week I mean. But would it need just one mosquito bite or would it need hundreds? Maybe that is why they mean more than three weeks.   I dont want to be freightened I will die or be brain damaged if I see a mosquito bite.     This bug repellent, are there any brands that might be more or less     Sorry if I seem worried but since I was recently frightened by doctors I wanted to ease my mind.

Re: Japanese encephalitis vaccine....   Feb 27, 2013, 3:14 AM      My view is that the doctor is more interested in his own income than your health. Vaccinations are quick, easy and profitable for doctors, and some have been known to recommend vaccinations for countries they really know nothing about.     If you want to get an insect repellant, get one with the active ingredient DEET. There are numerous brands available in many countries.

Feb 27, 2013, 6:20 AM      Despite the name "Japanese encephalitis", cases of "Japanese encephalitis" IN Japan are EXTREMELY rare.     If you look at this map:   …wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Japanese_encephalit…     Cases are nearly zero to 1 very very very rare chance in Japan.     It is "Japanese" only in name, but rarely found in Japan.     In all the years I've been in Japan, I never got the vaccine, nor have I ever thought about getting the vaccine since it's pretty extremely rare that anyone would get it.

Re: Japanese encephalitis vaccine....   Feb 27, 2013, 7:54 AM      Okay. I feel very convenienced at last. Living in a country where newspapers try to frighten us with everything they can come up with might have it's effect...     Anyway. Any other precautions other than DEET containing repellents? Is it not good to sleep with the window open at night in cities? Any places I should stay out off? (Can I visit pig farms or deep jungles of Yakushima for instance?) What do you think of the idea the doctor said a mosquito could come from a nearby pig farm and bite me, is it just... "bogus" so to say?     I will buy one repellent over here in Sweden but would you think it will be a problem if the Japanese customs search my bag and find it? (Might have to put it in on board bag since I dont know how it will react to the lower temp). I am pretty sure it doesnt contain any pseudo.... whatever it is called that is fobidden in Japan .     A bit off topic but Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended when traveling in countries like Greece, Spain, etc, would it be nessicary in Japan?     By the way, thank you for your replies.
