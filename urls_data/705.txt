Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

Twins          Back to Twins           English   Español       My son is going to have twins. I'm a fraternal twin and I have another brother and sister that are fraternal twins. My husband has on his side of the family twins (fraternal) and triplets - boys. Is our son having twins because of our background? Does it have to do with our genetics?        -A curious adult   June 25, 2014  That is a very interesting question! And one that many people wonder about. In fact, we answered a very similar question many years ago.  Twin genetics depend on what kind of twins we are talking about. Having identical twins is not genetic. On the other hand, fraternal twins can run in families.  Genetics can definitely play a role in having fraternal twins. For example, a woman that has a sibling that is a fraternal twin is 2.5 times more likely to have twins than average!  However, for a given pregnancy, only the mother’s genetics matter. Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are simultaneously fertilized instead of just one. A father’s genes can’t make a woman release two eggs.  It sounds like fraternal twins do indeed run in your family! But, since your son is the father, his genes are on the wrong side of the family tree. So, your family history likely didn’t play a role in his wife’s twin pregnancy.  The answer would be different if you were asking about a daughter. Also, although your son’s family history of twins can’t increase his wife’s chance of having twins, he can pass those genes down to your granddaughter. With your strong family history of fraternal twins, this just might increase the chances of your granddaughter having twins!  But, your daughter-in-law is not necessarily having twins because of her genetics. Other things like environment, nutrition, age, and weight have also been linked to having twins as well.  And there is always simple chance…every woman has a chance at having fraternal twins.  It is just that some women have a higher or lower chance.   Huh? Help Me Understand the Genetics!  Wait a minute. One type of twins has a genetic basis and the other does not? And, only the mom’s genetics matter? How is that possible?  Don’t worry. It makes a lot of sense once we break down the biology.  The important difference between identical and fraternal twins is the number of fertilized eggs involved. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg. Fraternal twins come from two different ones.  Identical twins happen when a single embryo splits in two soon after fertilization. This is why identical twins have identical DNA. They came from the same fertilized egg.  Since embryo splitting is a random event that happens by chance, it doesn’t run in families. Genes are not involved. The same is not true for fraternal twins.  Fraternal twins happen when two independent eggs are each fertilized by different sperm.  This is why the DNA of fraternal twins is different. In fact, fhe DNA of fraternal twins is no more similar than the DNA any other sibling pair.  Usually, a woman only releases a single egg at a time. Fraternal twins can only happen if a mother releases two eggs in one cycle. This is called hyperovulation.  Unlike embryo splitting, ovulation is a normal biological process that is controlled by our genes. And, different women can have different versions of these ovulation genes.  Some women have versions (called alleles) of these genes that make them more likely to hyperovulate. This means there is a higher chance that two eggs could get fertilized at once, leading to fraternal twins.  The gene versions that increase the chance of hyperovulation can be passed down from parent to child. This is why fraternal twins run in families.  However, only women ovulate. So, the mother’s genes control this and the fathers don’t.  This is why having a background of twins in the family matters only if it is on the mother’s side. And why your son’s family genetics did not play a role in his twins.  We went over a lot of this stuff in our previous answer, but your question got me thinking. Our last answer on twins was done so long ago. Has recent research discovered anything new on this fascinating topic? They have indeed… at least if you are a sheep!   Counting Sheep can Teach us about Twins  Scientists often turn to animals when they want to study a biological process. Some of the newest information we have about twin genetics comes from studying sheep.  Sheep were chosen because, like people, they typically give birth to a single lamb. However, they can sometimes have twins and triplets.  Different breeds of sheep naturally have higher or lower twin rates.  These different breeds have different versions (called alleles) of some of their genes. Specific alleles can make certain breeds more likely to have twins.  We can compare the genes between these different breeds to try to find the genes controlling twinning. And, this is just what scientists did.  A thorough search for genes controlling twining in sheep identified several interesting ones. The breeds with higher twin rates had different alleles of these genes!  Three key sheep genes identified were named BMP15, GDF9, and BMPR1B. The specific gene names are not really important. Just know that all of these genes are involved in controlling ovulation. Which makes sense!  Remember, hyperovulation increases the chance of having fraternal twins. The sheep breeds with higher than average twin rates had versions of the genes that increase ovulation.  Sheep are a great tool to help us study twin genetics. The tricky part is connecting these findings to people.  It is harder to study humans. Scientists have tried to find links between the genes identified in sheep and human twin genetics. So far they’ve found that some match up and some don’t. This, in and of itself, is interesting!  Another gene called follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH for short, has also been linked to twins in humans. Like the other three genes identified, this FSH is also involved in promoting ovulation, and mothers of fraternal twins often have high levels of it.  It seems that twin genetics is more complicated in humans than in sheep. More genes are likely involved. But, each new bit of information about the genes involved adds another puzzle piece to the complete genetic picture.  Maybe someday we will know all the genes that cause fraternal twins in people.  But for now, you can just tell your son that his genetics likely didn’t cause his twins. Scientists are still trying to figure out which, if any, genes on his wife’s side could possibly be the culprits!

Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are released in one cycle.  We can learn a lot about twinning by studying breeds of sheep that are more likely to have twins.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

These formative years are when their personalities are developed and they first start to gain some independence and, most importantly, individuality.....12-18 monthsIt's often said that a twin grows up with a built-in playmate, but each child's temperament, abilities and interests determine how well multiples interact. Twins share a great bond, but its one thing to share a womb or a birthday and quite another to share a toy!

What are the chances I'll have a miscarriage?  What complications might I have with twins or more?  Which complications may affect my babies?  Can I prevent twin pregnancy complications?  What are the chances I'll have a premature birth?  Is stillbirth more common in twins?    Why are twin or multiple pregnancies more high-risk? When doctors talk about high-risk pregnancies, they mean that these pregnancies need extra monitoring and care as a precaution (McAslan Fraser 2012) . Try not to worry too much if you've been told that carrying twins means your pregnancy is high-risk. Most mums who are expecting twins give birth to healthy babies (NHS 2014) .  Serious complications are relatively rare. But some complications , such as premature birth, are more common in twin pregnancies (NHS 2014) . That's why you'll be offered more antenatal appointments than a woman expecting one baby.  The best way to keep your pregnancy as problem-free as possible is to attend all your antenatal appointments . Then any complications that may arise can be spotted early. Ask your midwife about which concerning symptoms you should look out for, so you can be vigilant between your routine appointments. What are the chances I'll have a miscarriage? If you're carrying more than one baby, your risk of having a miscarriage is higher than with a single pregnancy (NCCWCH 2011) . But it's difficult to say by how much.  Sadly, early miscarriages in the first trimester are common for all pregnancies. Some happen so early that a woman may not even have noticed she's pregnant. Taking into account the number of these very early, missed miscarriages , calculating the different risks for the first trimester is hard.  It's more common for mums-to-be of twins or more to experience vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy and for the pregnancy to continue. Almost 30 per cent of mums of multiples report vaginal bleeding in their pregnancy (Tamba 2012) compared with up to 20 per cent of mums of a single baby (van Oppenraaij et al 2009) .  In a twin pregnancy, sometimes one baby is lost to miscarriage. If this happens during your first trimester, usually it doesn't affect your surviving baby (Anderson-Berry and Zach 2014, NHS 2014) . The embryo that didn't survive is so tiny that it's often reabsorbed into the lining of your womb (uterus), without causing you any noticeable symptoms. This is called vanishing twin syndrome .  Vanishing twin syndrome happens in up to 30 per cent of multiple pregnancies (Anderson-Berry and Zach 2014) . Because it has few or no symptoms, you may only know it's happened because you had a very early scan that showed two embryos originally.  It's natural to feel a sense of sadness and loss if you're affected by vanishing twin syndrome. Your hospital may have a counsellor or bereavement midwife you can talk to. You can also contact the Miscarriage Association . Chatting to other mums in our supportive community may help too. What complications might I have with twins or more? Growing two or more babies places greater demands on your body, and some problems may arise because of this. You're more likely to have pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (gestational hypertension) than if you were expecting a single baby (NCCWCH 2011) .   Pre-eclampsia is a complication related to high blood pressure that can happen in later pregnancy. It's more common in multiple pregnancies because having more than one baby places extra strain on the placenta or placentas.  Pre-eclampsia is at least three times more common if you're expecting twins, and nine times more common if you're expecting triplets, than if you were expecting one baby (NCCWCH 2011) .  Your midwife will keep a close watch for signs of pre-eclampsia. At every antenatal appointment she'll test your urine and check your blood pressure . High blood pressure and protein in your urine can be early signs of pre-eclampsia (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) .  To help protect you against pre-eclampsia, your doctor or midwife may advise you to take a low dose (75mg) of aspirin each day from 12 weeks, if:   it's your first pregnancy you're 40 or over you have a family history of pre-eclampsia your BMI is 35 or over it's more than 10 years since your last pregnancy (NCCWCH 2011)  Diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) is also more likely if you are expecting more than one baby (NCCWCH 2011, NHS 2014) . Your midwife will ask you about other risk factors, such as family history, for gestational diabetes at your booking appointment. Depending on her assessment, she may refer you for a glucose tolerance test (GTT) , which detects gestational diabetes, later in pregnancy.  Having a GTT is routine if you had a BMI over 30 when you became pregnant. Your midwife will also advise you on things you can change in your lifestyle to help protect you against gestational diabetes. She may ask to weigh you again at 28 weeks, and your team will keep a close eye on how your babies are growing.  You may become low in iron (anaemia) . All mums-to-be can become anaemic, because pregnancy causes the amount of blood flowing in their system to expand and become more diluted (Robson et al 2014) .  This can affect you even more when you're expecting more than one baby (Davies 2014, McAslan Fraser 2012) , making you feel especially tired. Having mild anaemia isn't harmful to your babies. Your body will make sure that your babies get their share of iron before you get yours (Pavord et al 2012) . But to make sure your levels are topped up, your midwife may recommend that you take an iron supplement.  To check your iron stores are not running low, your midwife will offer you an extra blood test when you're between 20 weeks and 24 weeks pregnant (NCCWCH 2011) . All pregnant women routinely have a blood test to check for iron levels at 28 weeks, and to confirm their blood group.   Obstetric cholestasis (OC) is an uncommon condition that affects the liver. It's thought to be caused by the pregnancy hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Because you have higher levels of these hormones, you're more prone to developing OC (McAslan Fraser 2012, RCOG 2011) .  OC causes extreme itching without a rash, which is typically worse at night (RCOG 2011) . Some itching is common in pregnancy, but if you are intensely itchy, particularly on your hands and feet, contact your doctor or midwife straight away (McAslan Fraser 2012) . Which complications may affect my babies? Most twins are born without any lasting problems (NHS 2014) . However, some abnormalities are more common in multiple pregnancies (NCCWCH 2011) .  Structural abnormalities, where a baby's chromosomes don’t develop normally, are twice as common in twins as in single babies (Sperling et al 2007) . Bear in mind that most single babies are born without abnormalities, so it's still unusual for twins to be born with a problem.  When structural anomalies do happen, they're most likely to result in a heart defect (NCCWCH 2011, Sperling et al 2007) . In most cases, multiples' heart problems are in the mild to moderate range, and can be treated by specialist paediatricians (Sperling et al 2007) .  Your midwife will advise you to take 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily for the first 12 weeks of your pregnancy (NICE 2008) . This will help to protect your babies against abnormalities affecting their brain, spine and spinal cord (neural tube defects).  You will have monitoring throughout your pregnancy to check how your babies are growing. Many abnormalities can be spotted in the first trimester, with combined screening (NHS 2015) . Your mid-pregnancy anomaly scan , which you'll have between 18 weeks and 20 weeks plus six days of pregnancy, is another opportunity to review your babies' development (NICE 2008) .  The news that there could be a problem will be the last thing you want to hear. But the sooner it's discovered that one baby or more has an abnormality, the better is their outlook. Then your specialist team can plan any extra care you need during pregnancy (NCCWCH 2011) , and any treatment your babies may need after birth.  It's more common for one or both babies to grow more slowly than expected for your stage of pregnancy. This is called intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Many twins are born small but perfectly healthy. However, your obstetrician will advise caution, as IUGR can make babies more vulnerable to health problems. This could be a reason to plan an early birth by caesarean section (NCCWCH 2011) .   Identical twins who share a placenta (monochorionic) are more likely to experience complications than twins who have a placenta each (dichorionic) (NCCWCH 2011, Skeie et al 2003) .  IUGR may be caused by problems with a shared placenta, one of the placentas or with how the umbilical cord connects to the placenta (Breathnach and Malone 2012) . You'll be offered regular scans to monitor how your babies are growing (NCCWCH 2011) .   Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare but potentially serious complication. It can happen to identical twins or triplets who are monochorionic, when some of the blood connections in the placenta are shared by both babies There's a risk that one baby (the recipient) gets too much blood from the placenta and the other baby (the donor) gets too little.  The donor baby may become smaller and anaemic due to not having enough blood. The recipient baby's higher blood volume may strain his heart.  If your twins or triplets are monochorionic, your medical team will closely monitor your babies for signs of TTTS with frequent ultrasound scans (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) . You can also watch out for these symptoms yourself, which are:   tightness across your belly a feeling that you've increased in size within a day or so TTTS affects up to 15 per cent of monochorionic twins (NCCWCH 2011) . The twins that are most at risk of complications are those that share a placenta and an amniotic sac (monochorionic monoamniotic or MCMA) (NCCWCH 2011, RCOG 2008) .  MCMA twins sometimes get tangled umbilical cords, because they are sharing the same space (RCOG 2008) . If you are expecting MCMA twins, you should be referred to a major hospital for care under a specialist consultant (NCCWCH 2011) . Can I prevent twin pregnancy complications? Early confirmation that you're carrying twins and whether or not they share a placenta will help. This allows your doctor plenty of time to detect, monitor and treat any complications that may arise.  Being fit and healthy may help you to cope better with a twin pregnancy and with any complications that may develop during the birth .  Here are tips for keeping your pregnancy as problem-free as possible:   Go to all your antenatal appointments.  Try to familiarise yourself with these warning signs of pre-eclampsia . Stick to a healthy diet . Stay hydrated (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) . Take gentle exercise such as swimming, Pilates or yoga, if your doctor or midwife says it's OK for you to do so (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) . If you smoke, the best thing you can do for your babies is to quit (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) . This is particularly important if your babies share a placenta, because the placenta is already having to work extra hard to provide enough oxygen. Your midwife can refer you for specialist support to help you stop. What are the chances I'll have a premature birth? It’s quite likely. Premature labour and birth , when your babies arrive earlier than expected, is one of the main complications associated with a twin pregnancy.  However, full-term for multiples is earlier than for single babies. While 40 weeks is full-term for a single baby, twins are considered full-term at 37 weeks, and triplets at 35 weeks.  More than half of all twins are born before 37 weeks, and 10 per cent are born before 32 weeks (HSCIC 2015, ISD Scotland 2014) . Those most vulnerable are very premature babies who are born before 30 weeks.  Because twins tend to be born early, there's a chance they'll need to spend time in special care after they're born (NCCWCH 2011) . This affects just under half of parents having twins and almost all those expecting triplets (Tamba 2012) .  You may have to go home while your babies are still in hospital, which can be very hard. The team caring for you will give you lots of support and preparation for going home after the birth if your babies are in SCBU. Is stillbirth more common in twins? Sadly, the number of babies who are stillborn is a little higher for multiple births (NCCWCH 2011) .  Five single babies per 1,000 are lost each year, whereas 12 babies per 1,000 in twin births and 31 babies per 1,000 in triplet births are lost (NCCWCH 2011) . Because premature birth is a common complication, twins or more are more vulnerable in their first month of life, too (NCCWCH 2011) .  To keep your babies as safe as possible, your doctor may recommend that you are offered an early, planned birth. This may be by caesarean or induction (NCCWCH 2011) .  Some babies are more vulnerable than others. Identical twins (monochorionic twins) are slightly more likely to experience problems than dichorionic twins (NCCWCH 2011, Skeie et al 2003) . However, it is a national policy for hospitals to offer planned birth for all multiple pregnancies, whether there are complications or not.

A BabyCentre Member  04/01/18    The implication that dichorionic twins are not identical is false; roughly 15% of same-sex dichorionic twins are identical. I have dichorionic twin girls that are identical. We have had them tested and they are definitely identical, despite having their own chorions and placentas.

No complications other than swollen feet. But the high risk that is so often placed on this condition can be very hard to deal with or help us be positive.

I'm 31+3 days with non-identical twins and every appointment and article are just so negative yet then you are told "try and enjoy your pregnancy!"
I really think there needs to be a culture change, yes we need to know the risks but we also need some positivity around multiples pregnancies and birth!!

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

Dizygotic twins are also known as fraternal or non-identical twins. They are the most common type of twins. Unlike monozygotic twins (also known as identical twins), dizygotic twins do not share the same genes. Monozygotic twins share 100 percent of each other genes. Dizygotic twins share only 50 percent.         This is the same genetic similarity found between siblings conceived and born at different times. Why Might Someone Conceive Dizygotic Twins? Dizygotic twins may occur if two or more oocytes (eggs) are released in one cycle. If each is fertilized, dizygotic twins may result. During IVF treatment , if two or more embryos are transferred, you may also get pregnant with twins (or more.) Fertility drugs are a common cause of dizygotic twins. Depending on which drug or fertility treatment is used, your odds of conceiving twins while taking fertility drugs ranges between 5 and 30 percent. Medications like Clomid and fertility procedures like IUI and IVF are responsible for the majority of twin births in the United States. But fertility drugs aren't the only cause for dizygotic twins. Your odds of conceiving twins may be higher if: The mother is 30 years of age or older The mother is taller than average   You have a family history of twins You're overweight You're African-American Here is more information on your odds of conceiving twins: What Increases Your Chances for Twins Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? What Location and Ethnicity Has to Do With Your Odds for Twins The odds of twins is highly affected by ethnicity and even location.         Those of African ethnicity are most likely to have twins, while Asians are least likely. Europeans fall into the mid-range. However, even within these broad categories, there can be a lot of differentiation. For example... In the United States, the twinning rates in 2003 were found to be 15.8 per 1,000 pregnancies. For Caucasian Americans, the rate was 15.7 per 1,000, while for black Americans, it was higher at 17.2 per 1,000. In Europe, the overall twinning rate in 2003 was 16.4 per 1,000 births. In Luxembourg and Portugal, the twinning rate was 11 in 1,000. Compare that to the twinning rates in Denmark, Greece, and the Netherlands where it was 20 per 1,000 births—almost twice as high. Nigeria has an overall high twinning rate, with an overall dizygotic twinning rate of 40 per 1,000 births. Still, variations are found in different regions. In Western and Eastern Nigeria, twinning rates were between 33 to 66.5 per 1,000 births. In Nothern Nigeria, rates were 19.4 per 1,000 for specific groups. These variations are found for dizygotic twins. But these differences by region and race are not found for monozygotic twins, or identical twins. The rate of identical twins is pretty much constant across all regions, occurring in approximately 4 per 1,000 pregnancies.          Dizygotic Twins and Gender Will you have boy-girl twins, boy-boy twins, or girl-girl twins? Here are your odds: Boy-girl twins are the most common kind of dizygotic twins, occurring 50 percent of the time. Girl-girl twins are the second most common occurrence. Boy-boy twins are the least common. Dizygotic Twins and Their Amniotic Sacs and Placentas Dizygotic twins typically have separate amniotic sacs and placentas. This is known as being dichorionic-diamniotic. (Sometimes called Di-Di for short.) This is the most common set-up for dizygotic twins. Di-Di twins also have the lowest pregnancy risks. Twin Pregnancy Risks for the Mother and Babies  There are rare instances of dizygotic twins who share one placenta. In this case, each has his or her own amniotic sac. This is referred to as monochorionic-diamniotic (Mo-Di for short). The risks are higher for twins sharing a placenta, due to the risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . The pregnancy may be monitored more closely. Because two placentas can fuse over time, it can be difficult to identify via ultrasound whether there are two placentas or one later in the pregnancy. For this reason, your doctor may send you for an ultrasound near the end of the first trimester, when it’s still possible to see the separation of two placentas. Reducing Your Risk of Twins When Using Fertility Treatments There has been an increase in dizygotic twinning in developed countries across the world, and this in large part occurred because of fertility treatment use. For a few decades, twin rates went up and up, until the year 2000, when rates finally started to drop slightly. They reached a peak and started to go down because as fertility treatment technology has advanced, reproductive specialists have found ways to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies. The goal of infertility treatment should always be one healthy baby, one at a time. It's not possible to completely eliminate the risk of twins during fertility treatment, but a few options are available. Using lowest effective dose for fertility treatments : The highest risk for twins occurs during injectable fertility drug use (gonadotropins) along with timed sexual intercourse or insemination. There is no control over how many follicles may develop or become fertilized. However, when doctors use just enough fertility medication to stimulate just one or two follicles, the odds of multiples can be reduced. Of course, if there are two follicles, the risk for twins is higher than if there is just one follicle. Also, if more than one—or a few to several—follicle develop, the doctor can "cancel" the cycle and ask the couple not to have sexual intercourse. Single embryo transfer IVF (SET-IVF) : With in vitro fertilization, the doctor can control how many embryos are transferred back to the uterus. When IVF was newer and less effective, transferring two to four embryos at a time wasn't uncommon. The hope was that at least one will "stick." But sometimes, more than one "stuck." Now, with young and good prognosis patients, single embryo transfer is an option. In this case, only one good quality embryo is transferred. There is still a very low risk of identical twinning. But the higher risk of dizygotic twinning is eliminated. Frozen embryo transfer IVF (FET-IVF) : Improvements in cryopreservation make single embryo transfer a viable option. Ideally, a couple will have more than just one good quality embryo. But what happens to the embryos not transferred? With FET-IVF, the "extra" embryos can be frozen for now. Then, if pregnancy doesn't occur, a future FET-IVF cycle can be tried. If pregnancy does occur with the first embryo transferred, you can keep the cryopreserved embryos "on ice" for future siblings, or they can be donated to another couple or to scientific research. Trizygotic Triplets and Quadrazygotic Quadruplets If three eggs are fertilized by three separate sperm, this may result in trizygotic triplets . If four eggs are fertilized by four separate sperm, you may get quadrazygotic quadruplets. It is also possible for a mother pregnant with high-order multiples to have a combination of twins. For example, triplets may start as nonidentical twins (or dizygotic twins). Then, one of those zygotes splits, leading to a set of identical twins (or monozygotic twins). Altogether, you would have two identical twins and one non-identical twin making up the set of triplets. If you find this hard to understand, try this. Take two pens, one red and one black. Draw a smiley face with the red pen, with a little baby hair on top. Draw another smiley face with the black pen. Now, from the black pen face, draw two lines down and out, each going to a separate new smiley face. In one big circle, draw a line around one of the red faces and two of the black faces. Those are the triplets -- two identical twins (black pen) and one "sibling" twin (red pen). However, the majority of high-order multiples are made up of non-identical twins.

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

These drugs are used to stimulate ovulation. Brand names that may be familiar to you include Gonal-F, Follistim, Ovidrel, Menopur, and Luveris. (More names below.) Gonadotropins are known informally as injectables. They are administered by injection only. (This is different from fertility drugs like Clomid and letrozole , which are pills you take by mouth.)         The naturally occurring hormones in the body FSH and LH are also known as gonadotropins. They play a pivotal role in ovulation . How Do They Work? To better understand how gonadotropins work, you should first understand how the female reproductive system works. Read an easy to understand, step-by-step explanation of the female reproductive cycle here. If you don't have time for that, here's a super quick recap! Normally, your pituitary gland produces FSH and LH at the beginning of your menstrual cycle. The FSH is sent out into the body. LH is stored in the pituitary gland until just before ovulation. FSH tells the follicles in your ovaries to wake up and grow. FSH stands for "follicle stimulating hormone." Makes perfect sense, given it stimulates the follicles ! Gonadotropin fertility drugs, that are FSH or FSH along with LH, act similarly. They tell the follicles on your ovaries to grow and develop.   LH typically peaks just before ovulation during a natural cycle and helps any mature eggs to go through one last growth spurt and release. In other words, ovulate! During treatment with gonadotropins, you may be given either an injection of rLH or, more commonly, hCG . This acts like the natural LH spike and will trigger ovulation.         What to Expect Gonadotropins may be used on their own. They may also be used as part of an IUI treatment or IVF treatment cycle. Below is an explanation of how they may be used on their own. When you get your next period, you'll call your doctor. You'll then have some blood work and an ultrasound. This is to make sure there are no complications or reasons you can't be treated in this cycle. (For example, to ensure you aren't pregnant and don't have a benign ovarian cyst .) Your doctor will likely start you off with 75 to 150 IU of the gonadotropin medication. Depending on which gonadotropin is prescribed, you'll need to give yourself injections just below the skin (subcutaneously) or into the muscle (intramuscularly). Ask your doctor or nurse to demonstrate how to safely perform the injections. They will likely do this without you asking. How to Give Yourself a Subcutaneous Injection How to Give Yourself an IM Injection Over the next several days, your hormone levels, specifically estradiol , and the follicles on your ovaries will be closely monitored. This monitoring happens via blood work and ultrasound every few days. How often? That will depend on your doctor's protocol, how you're responding to the drugs, and how close you are to ovulation.         Your medications may be adjusted up or down depending on the ultrasound and hormone results. The goal is to stimulate the ovaries enough to produce one good egg, but not to overstimulate them. Other stimulation can increase your risks of a multiple pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). When your hormone levels and follicle size indicate ovulation is close, your doctor may order an injection of hCG. This is also known as the " trigger shot ." It triggers ovulation to occur approximately 36 hours later. Your doctor should also tell you which days to have intercourse, so you can"catch" the egg and get pregnant!  How to Cope with Doctor Prescribed Conception Sex During Treatment Once ovulation occurs, you may then start taking progesterone . Not everyone will need this, however. Your hormone levels will continue to be monitored, though less frequently. You'll take a pregnancy test at the end of the cycle to determine if treatment was successful. Sometimes, treatment may be canceled in the middle. This may occur before the trigger shot or even earlier. The most common reason for cycle cancellation is your doctor suspects the ovaries have been hyperstimulated. Stopping the medications can avoid a serious case of OHSS and high-order multiples. Your doctor may also tell you to refrain from intercourse. As difficult as it is to hear this, it's very important you follow your doctor's instructions. Pregnancy can increase the chances of a high-order pregnancy, which puts you and your babies at risk. Also, if you develop OHSS, pregnancy can complicate your recovery. Different Types There are two basic types of gonadotropins: recombinant gonadotropins and urinary-extracted gonadotropins. Recombinant gonadotropins are created in a laboratory using recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant FSH gonadotropins on the market include Gonal-F and Follistim. Currently, Luveris is the only recombinant LH gonadotropin available. Urinary-extracted gonadotropins are extracted and purified from the urine of postmenopausal women. (Their urine is naturally high in FSH.) They include human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), purified FSH and highly purified FSH. Purified urine-extracted FSH gonadotropins include Bravelle and Fertinex. Human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) contains FSH and LH. It includes medications like Humegon, Menogon, Pergonal and Repronex. Menopur is a highly purified hMG. A related drug, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often part of fertility treatment with gonadotropin injections . You may know hCG as the pregnancy hormone , but it also happens to be molecularly similar to LH. In a natural cycle, LH triggers ovulation . As part of fertility treatment , an injection of hCG may be used to trigger ovulation. Ovidrel, Novarel, Pregnyl and Profasi are brand names for hCG injectables. Associated Risks Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially serious complication of gonadotropin therapy. Mild OHSS occurs in 10% to 20% of women taking gonadotropins. Serious OHSS occurs 1% of the time. Serious OHSS can be deadly if ignored or not treated properly. It's important you are familiar with the symptoms. OHSS Symptoms and Treatment Another possible risk factor of gonadotropin therapy is a multiple pregnancy. Some studies have found that up to 30% of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins are twins or more. (This is compared to just 1% to 2% of naturally conceived pregnancies.) Most multiple pregnancies with gonadotropins are twins. Up to 5% are triplets or more. Multiple pregnancies , including twin pregnancies , are risky for the mother and the babies. Close monitoring of a treatment cycle can help prevent a multiple pregnancy. Many doctors will cancel if more than three follicles develop or if estradiol levels are very high. Some studies have been able to get the rate of multiples pregnancies as low as 5%. They have done this by starting at a low dose, using slow increases only when necessary and close monitoring. Twin Pregnancy Risks Should I Get Pregnant with Twins on Purpose? Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? The risk of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage is higher with gonadotropin-conceived pregnancies. Less than 1% of women taking gonadotropins will experience adnexal torsion, or ovarian twisting. This is when the ovary twists on itself and cuts off its own blood supply. Surgery is necessary to untwist or possibly remove the affected ovary. Your risk of pregnancy complications -- like pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and placental abruption -- may be slightly increased as compared to a naturally conceived pregnancy. Whether this is caused by the gonadotropins or the infertility is unclear. Because gonadotropins are injectable medications, you may also experience soreness near the injection sites. If you suspect an infection, be sure to alert your doctor right away. Side Effects and Risks of Gonadotropins What Are the Success Rates? Your potential for pregnancy success with gonadotropins will depend on a variety of factors, including your age and the cause of infertility. A 2011 study by The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine looked at 1,400 gonadotropin treatment cycles. The overall pregnancy rate was 12%, with the live birth rate about 7.7%. Younger patients had higher live birth rates. In this study, by canceling the cycle if three or more dominant follicles developed or estradiol levels were higher than 1500 pg/ml, they were able to keep the multiple pregnancy rate a low 2.6%. Older studies have found higher pregnancy rates with gonadotropins than this one. However, it's possible the higher success rate came at the expense of higher risk for OHSS and multiple pregnancy. Cost of Treatment Gonadotropin treatment that is not an IUI or IVF cycle can cost anywhere between $500 to $5,000. The higher price takes into account blood work and ultrasound monitoring. Also, the price varies because different women will need different amounts of drugs. Your insurance company may pay for part of treatment. Or, they may pay for all of it... or none of it. You may need to pay your fertility clinic in full first. Then, you may need to file for a refund from your insurance yourself, or the clinic may handle the insurance claims for you. Be sure to clarify all of this with your fertility clinic before you start treatment. You don't want to be surprised by a high bill at the end.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: October 2016     Are multiple pregnancies riskier than single pregnancies? While the great majority of multiple pregnancies result in healthy babies, any pregnancy with twins or more is considered high risk. And the more babies you're carrying, the higher your risk of complications. The greatest risk is that you'll deliver the babies prematurely , which increases their chances of health problems.  What are the chances that I'll deliver prematurely? According to the March of Dimes, close to 60 percent of all twins and more than 90 percent of triplets are born prematurely (before 37 weeks). The average twin pregnancy lasts 35 weeks. Triplet pregnancies average 33 weeks, and quad pregnancies average 29 weeks.  What are the risks of premature birth? Babies born before their time may not be completely ready for the outside world. Their lungs, brain, and other organs may not be fully developed, their immune system may not be ready to fight off infections, and they may not be able to suck or swallow. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the risks. Premature babies born between 34 and 37 weeks generally do very well. Babies born before 28 weeks may survive, but they'll need intensive medical care and a little luck. If you go into labor before 34 weeks, your medical team may be able to delay your labor for a few days. They'll use this extra time to treat your babies with corticosteroids , drugs that help a baby's lungs and other organs develop faster to greatly increase the chances of survival. Your babies may also receive magnesium sulfate, which helps reduce the risk that they'll develop cerebral palsy.  What are other potential complications of having multiples? Aside from preterm labor, there are several possible problems: Twins and triplets often don't have a chance to reach a healthy weight before they're born. While the average single baby weighs 7 pounds at birth, the average twin weighs 5.5 pounds. Triplets typically weigh 4 pounds each, and quads weigh 3 pounds each. Babies born at under 5.5 pounds are considered to have a low birth weight. Babies with low birth weights are likely to have health problems even if they weren't born prematurely. Low-birth-weight babies often have trouble breathing on their own. They may not be fully prepared to fight infections, control their body temperature, or put on weight. For these reasons, almost all low-birth weight babies have to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit before going home. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, or kidney or liver abnormalities. It develops in roughly 10 to 15 percent of women carrying twins, two to three times the rate of women carrying one baby. The condition tends to develop earlier as well. And once it starts, it can be especially severe. When preeclampsia is severe, it can affect many of your organs and your placenta and cause serious or even life-threatening problems. Gestational diabetes is more common in women carrying more than one baby. If you develop gestational diabetes, your practitioner will monitor you closely. You'll most likely be able to keep your blood sugar levels under control with diet and exercise, but some women will require insulin shots or pills as well. Poorly controlled diabetes can have serious consequences for you and your babies. Placental abruption , when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, is also more likely when you're carrying more than one baby. It can happen any time in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to growth problems, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. In multiple pregnancies, abruption may occur just after the first baby has been delivered vaginally. Once abruption has occurred, the other baby or babies may have to be delivered by cesarean section. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication that occurs in identical twins when blood flows from one baby to the other through their shared placenta. According to the March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of identical twins develop the syndrome. The condition can be treated by using laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies' blood vessels.  Will I be put on bedrest? Your practitioner may put you on bedrest , especially if you develop complications such as preterm labor. There's no proof that bedrest can actually prevent premature delivery for women carrying multiple babies, but there are some situations where it may be beneficial to reduce your physical activity or take frequent breaks off your feet. If your practitioner recommends it, ask her to discuss the pros and cons with you. Also, find out exactly what you can and can't do and for how long. Bedrest can mean anything from curtailing your activities to literally not getting out of bed for any reason. Even if your pregnancy is going smoothly, most doctors and midwives advise taking it easy beginning early in the third trimester. Prepare yourself with a list of questions to ask about bedrest so you'll know exactly what to expect.   What are the chances that I'll lose one or more of the babies? When a woman is carrying twins, one baby might miscarry early in pregnancy while the other stays in place. This situation — called a vanishing twin — occurs in about 20 percent of all twin pregnancies. If you're carrying triplets, there's a 40 percent chance that one or more will miscarry in the first half of pregnancy. In the days before ultrasound, these miscarriages went largely unnoticed. The only symptom is vaginal bleeding, and the remaining baby (or babies) usually develops normally. Stillbirths — the loss of a baby after 20 weeks — are slightly more common in multiple pregnancies, but they're still rare. Only about 1 to 2 percent of twins or triplets are stillborn, compared with about 0.5 percent of singletons. Some babies are lost at the end of a pregnancy and are delivered along with the surviving baby. In rare cases, a stillborn twin can be delivered several weeks before the surviving twin. If you're carrying identical twins who are sharing a placenta, the loss of one twin after the 20th week can be very dangerous to the surviving baby. If your babies don't share a placenta, there's a good chance that your remaining baby can develop normally. In either case, your practitioner will likely take a "watch and see" approach. If your remaining baby isn't in immediate distress, there's usually no reason to induce delivery early.  What can I do to reduce my risk of problems? While many complications of twin pregnancies have little to do with your behavior or lifestyle, getting early confirmation that you are indeed carrying twins will give your healthcare provider plenty of time to catch and treat any complications that may crop up. Educate yourself about the most common risks and complications of twin pregnancies, but don't obsess about all the things that can go wrong. Become familiar with the warning signs of preterm labor. Make sure you are well nourished and well hydrated . Finally, don't miss any prenatal appointments and make sure to follow your provider's instructions.

Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: October 2016     Are multiple pregnancies riskier than single pregnancies? While the great majority of multiple pregnancies result in healthy babies, any pregnancy with twins or more is considered high risk. And the more babies you're carrying, the higher your risk of complications. The greatest risk is that you'll deliver the babies prematurely , which increases their chances of health problems.  What are the chances that I'll deliver prematurely? According to the March of Dimes, close to 60 percent of all twins and more than 90 percent of triplets are born prematurely (before 37 weeks). The average twin pregnancy lasts 35 weeks. Triplet pregnancies average 33 weeks, and quad pregnancies average 29 weeks.  What are the risks of premature birth? Babies born before their time may not be completely ready for the outside world. Their lungs, brain, and other organs may not be fully developed, their immune system may not be ready to fight off infections, and they may not be able to suck or swallow. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the risks. Premature babies born between 34 and 37 weeks generally do very well. Babies born before 28 weeks may survive, but they'll need intensive medical care and a little luck. If you go into labor before 34 weeks, your medical team may be able to delay your labor for a few days. They'll use this extra time to treat your babies with corticosteroids , drugs that help a baby's lungs and other organs develop faster to greatly increase the chances of survival. Your babies may also receive magnesium sulfate, which helps reduce the risk that they'll develop cerebral palsy.  What are other potential complications of having multiples? Aside from preterm labor, there are several possible problems: Twins and triplets often don't have a chance to reach a healthy weight before they're born. While the average single baby weighs 7 pounds at birth, the average twin weighs 5.5 pounds. Triplets typically weigh 4 pounds each, and quads weigh 3 pounds each. Babies born at under 5.5 pounds are considered to have a low birth weight. Babies with low birth weights are likely to have health problems even if they weren't born prematurely. Low-birth-weight babies often have trouble breathing on their own. They may not be fully prepared to fight infections, control their body temperature, or put on weight. For these reasons, almost all low-birth weight babies have to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit before going home. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, or kidney or liver abnormalities. It develops in roughly 10 to 15 percent of women carrying twins, two to three times the rate of women carrying one baby. The condition tends to develop earlier as well. And once it starts, it can be especially severe. When preeclampsia is severe, it can affect many of your organs and your placenta and cause serious or even life-threatening problems. Gestational diabetes is more common in women carrying more than one baby. If you develop gestational diabetes, your practitioner will monitor you closely. You'll most likely be able to keep your blood sugar levels under control with diet and exercise, but some women will require insulin shots or pills as well. Poorly controlled diabetes can have serious consequences for you and your babies. Placental abruption , when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, is also more likely when you're carrying more than one baby. It can happen any time in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to growth problems, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. In multiple pregnancies, abruption may occur just after the first baby has been delivered vaginally. Once abruption has occurred, the other baby or babies may have to be delivered by cesarean section. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication that occurs in identical twins when blood flows from one baby to the other through their shared placenta. According to the March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of identical twins develop the syndrome. The condition can be treated by using laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies' blood vessels.  Will I be put on bedrest? Your practitioner may put you on bedrest , especially if you develop complications such as preterm labor. There's no proof that bedrest can actually prevent premature delivery for women carrying multiple babies, but there are some situations where it may be beneficial to reduce your physical activity or take frequent breaks off your feet. If your practitioner recommends it, ask her to discuss the pros and cons with you. Also, find out exactly what you can and can't do and for how long. Bedrest can mean anything from curtailing your activities to literally not getting out of bed for any reason. Even if your pregnancy is going smoothly, most doctors and midwives advise taking it easy beginning early in the third trimester. Prepare yourself with a list of questions to ask about bedrest so you'll know exactly what to expect.   What are the chances that I'll lose one or more of the babies? When a woman is carrying twins, one baby might miscarry early in pregnancy while the other stays in place. This situation — called a vanishing twin — occurs in about 20 percent of all twin pregnancies. If you're carrying triplets, there's a 40 percent chance that one or more will miscarry in the first half of pregnancy. In the days before ultrasound, these miscarriages went largely unnoticed. The only symptom is vaginal bleeding, and the remaining baby (or babies) usually develops normally. Stillbirths — the loss of a baby after 20 weeks — are slightly more common in multiple pregnancies, but they're still rare. Only about 1 to 2 percent of twins or triplets are stillborn, compared with about 0.5 percent of singletons. Some babies are lost at the end of a pregnancy and are delivered along with the surviving baby. In rare cases, a stillborn twin can be delivered several weeks before the surviving twin. If you're carrying identical twins who are sharing a placenta, the loss of one twin after the 20th week can be very dangerous to the surviving baby. If your babies don't share a placenta, there's a good chance that your remaining baby can develop normally. In either case, your practitioner will likely take a "watch and see" approach. If your remaining baby isn't in immediate distress, there's usually no reason to induce delivery early.  What can I do to reduce my risk of problems? While many complications of twin pregnancies have little to do with your behavior or lifestyle, getting early confirmation that you are indeed carrying twins will give your healthcare provider plenty of time to catch and treat any complications that may crop up. Educate yourself about the most common risks and complications of twin pregnancies, but don't obsess about all the things that can go wrong. Become familiar with the warning signs of preterm labor. Make sure you are well nourished and well hydrated . Finally, don't miss any prenatal appointments and make sure to follow your provider's instructions.

Placental abruption , when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, is also more likely when you're carrying more than one baby. It can happen any time in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to growth problems, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. In multiple pregnancies, abruption may occur just after the first baby has been delivered vaginally. Once abruption has occurred, the other baby or babies may have to be delivered by cesarean section. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication that occurs in identical twins when blood flows from one baby to the other through their shared placenta. According to the March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of identical twins develop the syndrome. The condition can be treated by using laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies' blood vessels.  Will I be put on bedrest? Your practitioner may put you on bedrest , especially if you develop complications such as preterm labor. There's no proof that bedrest can actually prevent premature delivery for women carrying multiple babies, but there are some situations where it may be beneficial to reduce your physical activity or take frequent breaks off your feet. If your practitioner recommends it, ask her to discuss the pros and cons with you. Also, find out exactly what you can and can't do and for how long. Bedrest can mean anything from curtailing your activities to literally not getting out of bed for any reason. Even if your pregnancy is going smoothly, most doctors and midwives advise taking it easy beginning early in the third trimester. Prepare yourself with a list of questions to ask about bedrest so you'll know exactly what to expect.   What are the chances that I'll lose one or more of the babies? When a woman is carrying twins, one baby might miscarry early in pregnancy while the other stays in place. This situation — called a vanishing twin — occurs in about 20 percent of all twin pregnancies. If you're carrying triplets, there's a 40 percent chance that one or more will miscarry in the first half of pregnancy. In the days before ultrasound, these miscarriages went largely unnoticed. The only symptom is vaginal bleeding, and the remaining baby (or babies) usually develops normally. Stillbirths — the loss of a baby after 20 weeks — are slightly more common in multiple pregnancies, but they're still rare. Only about 1 to 2 percent of twins or triplets are stillborn, compared with about 0.5 percent of singletons. Some babies are lost at the end of a pregnancy and are delivered along with the surviving baby. In rare cases, a stillborn twin can be delivered several weeks before the surviving twin. If you're carrying identical twins who are sharing a placenta, the loss of one twin after the 20th week can be very dangerous to the surviving baby. If your babies don't share a placenta, there's a good chance that your remaining baby can develop normally. In either case, your practitioner will likely take a "watch and see" approach. If your remaining baby isn't in immediate distress, there's usually no reason to induce delivery early.  What can I do to reduce my risk of problems? While many complications of twin pregnancies have little to do with your behavior or lifestyle, getting early confirmation that you are indeed carrying twins will give your healthcare provider plenty of time to catch and treat any complications that may crop up. Educate yourself about the most common risks and complications of twin pregnancies, but don't obsess about all the things that can go wrong. Become familiar with the warning signs of preterm labor. Make sure you are well nourished and well hydrated . Finally, don't miss any prenatal appointments and make sure to follow your provider's instructions.

Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: October 2016     Are multiple pregnancies riskier than single pregnancies? While the great majority of multiple pregnancies result in healthy babies, any pregnancy with twins or more is considered high risk. And the more babies you're carrying, the higher your risk of complications. The greatest risk is that you'll deliver the babies prematurely , which increases their chances of health problems.  What are the chances that I'll deliver prematurely? According to the March of Dimes, close to 60 percent of all twins and more than 90 percent of triplets are born prematurely (before 37 weeks). The average twin pregnancy lasts 35 weeks. Triplet pregnancies average 33 weeks, and quad pregnancies average 29 weeks.  What are the risks of premature birth? Babies born before their time may not be completely ready for the outside world. Their lungs, brain, and other organs may not be fully developed, their immune system may not be ready to fight off infections, and they may not be able to suck or swallow. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the risks. Premature babies born between 34 and 37 weeks generally do very well. Babies born before 28 weeks may survive, but they'll need intensive medical care and a little luck. If you go into labor before 34 weeks, your medical team may be able to delay your labor for a few days. They'll use this extra time to treat your babies with corticosteroids , drugs that help a baby's lungs and other organs develop faster to greatly increase the chances of survival. Your babies may also receive magnesium sulfate, which helps reduce the risk that they'll develop cerebral palsy.  What are other potential complications of having multiples? Aside from preterm labor, there are several possible problems: Twins and triplets often don't have a chance to reach a healthy weight before they're born. While the average single baby weighs 7 pounds at birth, the average twin weighs 5.5 pounds. Triplets typically weigh 4 pounds each, and quads weigh 3 pounds each. Babies born at under 5.5 pounds are considered to have a low birth weight. Babies with low birth weights are likely to have health problems even if they weren't born prematurely. Low-birth-weight babies often have trouble breathing on their own. They may not be fully prepared to fight infections, control their body temperature, or put on weight. For these reasons, almost all low-birth weight babies have to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit before going home. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, or kidney or liver abnormalities. It develops in roughly 10 to 15 percent of women carrying twins, two to three times the rate of women carrying one baby. The condition tends to develop earlier as well. And once it starts, it can be especially severe. When preeclampsia is severe, it can affect many of your organs and your placenta and cause serious or even life-threatening problems. Gestational diabetes is more common in women carrying more than one baby. If you develop gestational diabetes, your practitioner will monitor you closely. You'll most likely be able to keep your blood sugar levels under control with diet and exercise, but some women will require insulin shots or pills as well. Poorly controlled diabetes can have serious consequences for you and your babies. Placental abruption , when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, is also more likely when you're carrying more than one baby. It can happen any time in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to growth problems, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. In multiple pregnancies, abruption may occur just after the first baby has been delivered vaginally. Once abruption has occurred, the other baby or babies may have to be delivered by cesarean section. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication that occurs in identical twins when blood flows from one baby to the other through their shared placenta. According to the March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of identical twins develop the syndrome. The condition can be treated by using laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies' blood vessels.  Will I be put on bedrest? Your practitioner may put you on bedrest , especially if you develop complications such as preterm labor. There's no proof that bedrest can actually prevent premature delivery for women carrying multiple babies, but there are some situations where it may be beneficial to reduce your physical activity or take frequent breaks off your feet. If your practitioner recommends it, ask her to discuss the pros and cons with you. Also, find out exactly what you can and can't do and for how long. Bedrest can mean anything from curtailing your activities to literally not getting out of bed for any reason. Even if your pregnancy is going smoothly, most doctors and midwives advise taking it easy beginning early in the third trimester. Prepare yourself with a list of questions to ask about bedrest so you'll know exactly what to expect.   What are the chances that I'll lose one or more of the babies? When a woman is carrying twins, one baby might miscarry early in pregnancy while the other stays in place. This situation — called a vanishing twin — occurs in about 20 percent of all twin pregnancies. If you're carrying triplets, there's a 40 percent chance that one or more will miscarry in the first half of pregnancy. In the days before ultrasound, these miscarriages went largely unnoticed. The only symptom is vaginal bleeding, and the remaining baby (or babies) usually develops normally. Stillbirths — the loss of a baby after 20 weeks — are slightly more common in multiple pregnancies, but they're still rare. Only about 1 to 2 percent of twins or triplets are stillborn, compared with about 0.5 percent of singletons. Some babies are lost at the end of a pregnancy and are delivered along with the surviving baby. In rare cases, a stillborn twin can be delivered several weeks before the surviving twin. If you're carrying identical twins who are sharing a placenta, the loss of one twin after the 20th week can be very dangerous to the surviving baby. If your babies don't share a placenta, there's a good chance that your remaining baby can develop normally. In either case, your practitioner will likely take a "watch and see" approach. If your remaining baby isn't in immediate distress, there's usually no reason to induce delivery early.  What can I do to reduce my risk of problems? While many complications of twin pregnancies have little to do with your behavior or lifestyle, getting early confirmation that you are indeed carrying twins will give your healthcare provider plenty of time to catch and treat any complications that may crop up. Educate yourself about the most common risks and complications of twin pregnancies, but don't obsess about all the things that can go wrong. Become familiar with the warning signs of preterm labor. Make sure you are well nourished and well hydrated . Finally, don't miss any prenatal appointments and make sure to follow your provider's instructions.

So… the odds aren’t exactly with you. Or are they? Turns out, there are a number of factors that can affect your odds of getting pregnant with multiples and having twin babies. These include your age, diet, number of pregnancies you’ve had, ethnicity, location, body type, and more. So what are your chancing of having twins or multiples? Take our just-for-fun quiz to find out instantly!  1. Do you have fraternal twins in your family?  Not that I know of  Yes, on my dad’s side  Yes, on my mom’s side  Yes, more than one set on my mom’s side 2. Are you overweight and/or taller than average?  Yes  No 3. What is your ethnicity?  Nigerian  African  Caucasian  Hispanic or Asian  Other 4. Where do you live?  Nigeria  Central Africa  North America or Europe  Latin America or Asia  Other 5. Do you eat a high fat diet?  Yep, full fat pastured yogurt, coconut oil, and pastured bacon  Yes, but it mostly comes from conventional animal products  I try to limit my consumption of fat 6. Do you frequently eat large amounts of phytoestrogen foods such as soy, tempeh, flax, sesame seeds, oats, barley, dried beans, lentils, yams, alfalfa, and mung beans?  Yes, I eat large servings of those foods daily  Sure, but not daily  No, I hardly ever eat those foods 7. How old are you?  Under 35  35-39  Over 40 8. How many full-term pregnancies have you had (including your current pregnancy)?  This is my first  2  3  4+ 9. Did you use fertility treatments to conceive?  Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I am told you will need to eat more but when does that start? There does not seem to be a lot of information on twins and how you deal with health and changes over a single birth! I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

You may need to go to extra prenatal care checkups so your health care provider can check you and your babies closely during pregnancy.  The most common complication of being pregnant with multiples is premature birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy).       What causes you to get pregnant with multiples?  A multiple pregnancy (being pregnant with multiples) means you’re pregnant with more than one baby. If you’re pregnant with higher-order multiples, it means you’re pregnant with three or more babies.  Multiple pregnancy usually happens when more than one egg is fertilized by a man’s sperm. But it also can happen when one egg is fertilized and then splits into two or more embryos that grow into two or more babies.  Twins are called identical when one fertilized egg splits into two. Identical twins look almost exactly alike and share the exact same genes. Twins are fraternal when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm. Fraternal twins don’t share the same genes and are no more alike than any brothers and sisters from different pregnancies with the same mother and father.  Most babies are singleton babies. This means you’re pregnant with just one baby. But more women are getting pregnant with multiples now than in the past. This is mostly because more women are having babies later in life, and you’re more likely to have multiples if you’re older than 30 . Also, more women are using fertility treatment to get pregnant. Fertility treatment is medical treatment to help women get pregnant.  How do you know if you’re pregnant with multiples?  You may be pregnant with multiples if:   Your breasts are very sore.  You’re very hungry or you gain weight quickly in the first trimester.  You feel movement in different parts of your belly at the same time.  You have severe morning sickness . Morning sickness is nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting that happens in the first few months of pregnancy, usually in the first few months. It’s sometimes called nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or NVP.  Your health care provider hears more than one heartbeat or finds that your uterus (womb) is larger than usual. The uterus is the place inside you where your baby grows.  You have high levels of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin (also called hCG) or a protein called alpha-fetoprotein in your blood. HCG is a hormone your body makes during pregnancy. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein that a developing baby makes during pregnancy.   Your provider uses ultrasound to find out for sure if you’re pregnant with multiples. Ultrasound uses sound waves and a computer screen to show a picture of a baby in the womb.  What kind of prenatal care do you need if you’re pregnant with multiples?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, you may need extra medical care during pregnancy, labor and birth . You may need to go to extra prenatal care checkups so your provider can watch you and your babies for problems. You also may need more prenatal tests (like ultrasounds) to check on your growing babies throughout your pregnancy.  If you’ve had pregnancy complications in the past or if you have health conditions that put you at risk for pregnancy complications, your provider may refer you to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist. This is a doctor with education and training to take care of women who have high-risk pregnancies. High-risk means you’re more likely than most pregnant women to have problems with your pregnancy. If you’re referred to this kind of doctor, it doesn’t mean you’ll have problems during pregnancy. It just means he can check you and your babies closely to help prevent or treat any conditions that may happen.  How can a multiple pregnancy affect your health?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, you’re more likely than if you were pregnant with one baby to have complications, including:   Preterm labor. This is labor that happens too early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm labor can lead to premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy).  Anemia. Anemia is when you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the rest of your body. You may have anemia if your body isn’t getting enough iron. A condition called iron-deficiency anemia is common in multiple pregnancies and can increase your chances of premature birth. Your provider may prescribe an iron supplement for you to make sure you’re getting enough iron.  Gestational diabetes. This is a kind of diabetes that only pregnant women can get. If untreated, it can cause serious health problems for you and your babies. Diabetes is when you have too much sugar (called blood sugar or glucose) in your blood.  Gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. These are types of high blood pressure that only pregnant women can get. High blood pressure is when the force of blood against the walls of your blood vessels is too high. It can cause problems during pregnancy. Preeclampsia is a condition that can happen after the 20th week of pregnancy or right after pregnancy. It’s when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and signs that some of her organs, like her kidneys and liver, may not be working properly.  Hyperemesis gravidarum. This is a severe kind of morning sickness or nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (also called NVP).  Polyhydramnios. This is when you have too much amniotic fluid . Amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds your baby in your uterus (womb).  Miscarriage or stillbirth. Miscarriage is when a baby dies in the womb before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Stillbirth is when a baby dies in the womb after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Some women who are pregnant with multiples have a condition called vanishing twin syndrome. This is when one or more babies die in the womb, but one baby survives.   If you’re having multiples, you’re more likely to have these complications after giving birth:   Postpartum depression (also called PPD). This is a kind of depression that some women get after having a baby. PPD is strong feelings of sadness that last for a long time. These feelings can make it hard for you to take care of your baby.  Postpartum hemorrhage. This is heavy bleeding after giving birth. It’s a serious but rare condition.   How can being pregnant with multiples affect your babies’ health?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, your babies are more likely to have health complications, including:   Premature birth.  Premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) may have more health problems or need to stay in the hospital longer than babies born later. Some may spend time in a hospital’s newborn intensive care unit (also called NICU). This is the part of a hospital that takes care of sick babies. Premature babies also may have long-term health problems that can affect their whole lives. More than half of twins and nearly all triplets and other higher-order multiples are born prematurely. The earlier in pregnancy your babies are born, the more likely they are to have health problems.  Birth defects. Birth defects are health conditions that are present at birth. They change the shape or function of one or more parts of the body. Birth defects can cause problems in overall health, how the body develops or how the body works. Multiples are about twice as likely as singleton babies to have birth defects, including neural tube defects (like spina bifida ), cerebral palsy , congenital heart defects and birth defects that affect the digestive system. The digestive system helps your baby’s body process food.  Growth problems. Multiples are usually smaller than singleton babies. Your provider can use ultrasound to check your babies’ growth at prenatal care checkups. When one twin is much smaller than the other, they’re called discordant twins. Discordant twins are more likely to have health problems during pregnancy and after birth.  Low birthweight (also called LBW). This is when your baby is born weighing less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces. Babies with LBW are more likely than babies born at a normal weight to have certain health problems, like retinopathy of prematurity . They’re also more likely to have health problems later in life, like high blood pressure. More than half of twins and nearly all higher order multiples are born with LBW.  Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (also called TTTS). This condition happens when identical twins share a placenta and one baby gets too much blood flow, while the other baby doesn’t get enough. The placenta grows in your uterus (womb) and supplies your babies with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord. TTTS can be treated with laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies’ blood vessels and amniocentesis (also called amnio) to drain off extra fluid.  Neonatal death. This is when a baby dies in the first 28 days of life. Premature birth is the most common cause of neonatal death.   Are you more likely than other women to get pregnant with multiples?  You may be more likely than other women to get pregnant with more than one baby if:   You have fertility treatment. If you’re having fertility treatment, it’s important to try to get pregnant with just one baby. For example, if you’re having a treatment called in vitro fertilization (also called IVF), you can have just one embryo placed in your uterus. This is called single embryo transfer (also called SET). In IVF, an egg and sperm are combined in a lab to create an embryo (fertilized egg) which is then put into your uterus. If you’re having any kind of fertility treatment, talk to your provider about ways to help lower your chances of getting pregnant with multiples.  You’re in your 30s, especially your late 30s. If you’re 30 or older, you’re more likely than younger women to release more than one egg during a menstrual cycle (also called your period).  You have a family history of multiples. Family history is a record of health conditions and treatments that you, your partner and everyone in your families has had. If you or other women in your family have had fraternal twins, you may be more likely to have twins, too. You’re also more likely to have multiples if you’ve been pregnant before, especially if you’ve been pregnant with multiples.  You’re obese . If you're obese, you have an excess amount of body fat and your body mass index (also called BMI) is 30 or higher. To find out your BMI, go to cdc.gov/bmi .  You’re black or Caucasian. Black women are more likely to have twins than other women. Caucasian women, especially those older than 35 years old, are most likely to have higher-order multiples.   How are multiples born?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, you’re more likely to have a cesarean birth (also called c-section) than if you’re pregnant with one baby. A c-section is surgery in which your baby is born through a cut that your doctor makes in your belly and uterus. Most triplets and higher-order multiples are born by c-section.  If you’re pregnant with twins, you may need a c-section if neither baby is in the head-down position or if you have other complications. You may be able to have a vaginal birth if:   Both babies are in the head-down position and you have no other complications  The lower twin is in the head-down position but the higher twin isn’t.   Vaginal birth is the way most babies are born. During vaginal birth, the uterus (womb) contracts to help push the baby out through the vagina.  Do you need to eat special foods if you’re pregnant with multiples?  No. But you do need more of certain nutrients, like folic acid , protein, iron and calcium. You can get the right amount of these nutrients by eating healthy foods and taking your prenatal vitamin every day. Prenatal vitamins are multivitamins made just for pregnant women. Compared to a regular multivitamin, they have more of some nutrients that you need during pregnancy. Your provider can prescribe a prenatal vitamin for you at your first prenatal care checkup. Even when you’re pregnant with multiples, you only need to take one prenatal vitamin each day.  How much weight should you gain if you’re pregnant with multiples?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, you need to gain more weight than if you were pregnant one baby. The amount of weight to gain depends on your weight before pregnancy and how many babies you have. Talk to your provider about how much weight to gain.  Here’s what you should know about gaining weight if you’re pregnant with twins:   If you were at a healthy weight before pregnancy, you want to gain about 37 to 54 pounds during pregnancy.  If you were overweight before pregnancy, you want to gain about 31 to 50 pounds during pregnancy.  If you were obese before pregnancy, you want to gain about 25 to 42 pounds during pregnancy.   Do you need to limit physical activity if you’re pregnant with multiples?  Talk to your provider about what kind of activities are safe for you to do. You may need to cut out any high-impact activities, like aerobics or jogging, that make you jump or put stress on your joints. But you may be able to do some activities, like swimming, prenatal yoga or walking.  You may need to limit physical activity later in pregnancy, including travel and work. Many women pregnant with multiples go on bed rest. Bed rest means reducing your activities while you’re pregnant. Bed rest may mean staying in bed all day or just resting a few times each day.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

Twins          Back to Twins           English   Español       My son is going to have twins. I'm a fraternal twin and I have another brother and sister that are fraternal twins. My husband has on his side of the family twins (fraternal) and triplets - boys. Is our son having twins because of our background? Does it have to do with our genetics?        -A curious adult   June 25, 2014  That is a very interesting question! And one that many people wonder about. In fact, we answered a very similar question many years ago.  Twin genetics depend on what kind of twins we are talking about. Having identical twins is not genetic. On the other hand, fraternal twins can run in families.  Genetics can definitely play a role in having fraternal twins. For example, a woman that has a sibling that is a fraternal twin is 2.5 times more likely to have twins than average!  However, for a given pregnancy, only the mother’s genetics matter. Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are simultaneously fertilized instead of just one. A father’s genes can’t make a woman release two eggs.  It sounds like fraternal twins do indeed run in your family! But, since your son is the father, his genes are on the wrong side of the family tree. So, your family history likely didn’t play a role in his wife’s twin pregnancy.  The answer would be different if you were asking about a daughter. Also, although your son’s family history of twins can’t increase his wife’s chance of having twins, he can pass those genes down to your granddaughter. With your strong family history of fraternal twins, this just might increase the chances of your granddaughter having twins!  But, your daughter-in-law is not necessarily having twins because of her genetics. Other things like environment, nutrition, age, and weight have also been linked to having twins as well.  And there is always simple chance…every woman has a chance at having fraternal twins.  It is just that some women have a higher or lower chance.   Huh? Help Me Understand the Genetics!  Wait a minute. One type of twins has a genetic basis and the other does not? And, only the mom’s genetics matter? How is that possible?  Don’t worry. It makes a lot of sense once we break down the biology.  The important difference between identical and fraternal twins is the number of fertilized eggs involved. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg. Fraternal twins come from two different ones.  Identical twins happen when a single embryo splits in two soon after fertilization. This is why identical twins have identical DNA. They came from the same fertilized egg.  Since embryo splitting is a random event that happens by chance, it doesn’t run in families. Genes are not involved. The same is not true for fraternal twins.  Fraternal twins happen when two independent eggs are each fertilized by different sperm.  This is why the DNA of fraternal twins is different. In fact, fhe DNA of fraternal twins is no more similar than the DNA any other sibling pair.  Usually, a woman only releases a single egg at a time. Fraternal twins can only happen if a mother releases two eggs in one cycle. This is called hyperovulation.  Unlike embryo splitting, ovulation is a normal biological process that is controlled by our genes. And, different women can have different versions of these ovulation genes.  Some women have versions (called alleles) of these genes that make them more likely to hyperovulate. This means there is a higher chance that two eggs could get fertilized at once, leading to fraternal twins.  The gene versions that increase the chance of hyperovulation can be passed down from parent to child. This is why fraternal twins run in families.  However, only women ovulate. So, the mother’s genes control this and the fathers don’t.  This is why having a background of twins in the family matters only if it is on the mother’s side. And why your son’s family genetics did not play a role in his twins.  We went over a lot of this stuff in our previous answer, but your question got me thinking. Our last answer on twins was done so long ago. Has recent research discovered anything new on this fascinating topic? They have indeed… at least if you are a sheep!   Counting Sheep can Teach us about Twins  Scientists often turn to animals when they want to study a biological process. Some of the newest information we have about twin genetics comes from studying sheep.  Sheep were chosen because, like people, they typically give birth to a single lamb. However, they can sometimes have twins and triplets.  Different breeds of sheep naturally have higher or lower twin rates.  These different breeds have different versions (called alleles) of some of their genes. Specific alleles can make certain breeds more likely to have twins.  We can compare the genes between these different breeds to try to find the genes controlling twinning. And, this is just what scientists did.  A thorough search for genes controlling twining in sheep identified several interesting ones. The breeds with higher twin rates had different alleles of these genes!  Three key sheep genes identified were named BMP15, GDF9, and BMPR1B. The specific gene names are not really important. Just know that all of these genes are involved in controlling ovulation. Which makes sense!  Remember, hyperovulation increases the chance of having fraternal twins. The sheep breeds with higher than average twin rates had versions of the genes that increase ovulation.  Sheep are a great tool to help us study twin genetics. The tricky part is connecting these findings to people.  It is harder to study humans. Scientists have tried to find links between the genes identified in sheep and human twin genetics. So far they’ve found that some match up and some don’t. This, in and of itself, is interesting!  Another gene called follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH for short, has also been linked to twins in humans. Like the other three genes identified, this FSH is also involved in promoting ovulation, and mothers of fraternal twins often have high levels of it.  It seems that twin genetics is more complicated in humans than in sheep. More genes are likely involved. But, each new bit of information about the genes involved adds another puzzle piece to the complete genetic picture.  Maybe someday we will know all the genes that cause fraternal twins in people.  But for now, you can just tell your son that his genetics likely didn’t cause his twins. Scientists are still trying to figure out which, if any, genes on his wife’s side could possibly be the culprits!

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

These formative years are when their personalities are developed and they first start to gain some independence and, most importantly, individuality.....12-18 monthsIt's often said that a twin grows up with a built-in playmate, but each child's temperament, abilities and interests determine how well multiples interact. Twins share a great bond, but its one thing to share a womb or a birthday and quite another to share a toy!

What are the chances I'll have a miscarriage?  What complications might I have with twins or more?  Which complications may affect my babies?  Can I prevent twin pregnancy complications?  What are the chances I'll have a premature birth?  Is stillbirth more common in twins?    Why are twin or multiple pregnancies more high-risk? When doctors talk about high-risk pregnancies, they mean that these pregnancies need extra monitoring and care as a precaution (McAslan Fraser 2012) . Try not to worry too much if you've been told that carrying twins means your pregnancy is high-risk. Most mums who are expecting twins give birth to healthy babies (NHS 2014) .  Serious complications are relatively rare. But some complications , such as premature birth, are more common in twin pregnancies (NHS 2014) . That's why you'll be offered more antenatal appointments than a woman expecting one baby.  The best way to keep your pregnancy as problem-free as possible is to attend all your antenatal appointments . Then any complications that may arise can be spotted early. Ask your midwife about which concerning symptoms you should look out for, so you can be vigilant between your routine appointments. What are the chances I'll have a miscarriage? If you're carrying more than one baby, your risk of having a miscarriage is higher than with a single pregnancy (NCCWCH 2011) . But it's difficult to say by how much.  Sadly, early miscarriages in the first trimester are common for all pregnancies. Some happen so early that a woman may not even have noticed she's pregnant. Taking into account the number of these very early, missed miscarriages , calculating the different risks for the first trimester is hard.  It's more common for mums-to-be of twins or more to experience vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy and for the pregnancy to continue. Almost 30 per cent of mums of multiples report vaginal bleeding in their pregnancy (Tamba 2012) compared with up to 20 per cent of mums of a single baby (van Oppenraaij et al 2009) .  In a twin pregnancy, sometimes one baby is lost to miscarriage. If this happens during your first trimester, usually it doesn't affect your surviving baby (Anderson-Berry and Zach 2014, NHS 2014) . The embryo that didn't survive is so tiny that it's often reabsorbed into the lining of your womb (uterus), without causing you any noticeable symptoms. This is called vanishing twin syndrome .  Vanishing twin syndrome happens in up to 30 per cent of multiple pregnancies (Anderson-Berry and Zach 2014) . Because it has few or no symptoms, you may only know it's happened because you had a very early scan that showed two embryos originally.  It's natural to feel a sense of sadness and loss if you're affected by vanishing twin syndrome. Your hospital may have a counsellor or bereavement midwife you can talk to. You can also contact the Miscarriage Association . Chatting to other mums in our supportive community may help too. What complications might I have with twins or more? Growing two or more babies places greater demands on your body, and some problems may arise because of this. You're more likely to have pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (gestational hypertension) than if you were expecting a single baby (NCCWCH 2011) .   Pre-eclampsia is a complication related to high blood pressure that can happen in later pregnancy. It's more common in multiple pregnancies because having more than one baby places extra strain on the placenta or placentas.  Pre-eclampsia is at least three times more common if you're expecting twins, and nine times more common if you're expecting triplets, than if you were expecting one baby (NCCWCH 2011) .  Your midwife will keep a close watch for signs of pre-eclampsia. At every antenatal appointment she'll test your urine and check your blood pressure . High blood pressure and protein in your urine can be early signs of pre-eclampsia (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) .  To help protect you against pre-eclampsia, your doctor or midwife may advise you to take a low dose (75mg) of aspirin each day from 12 weeks, if:   it's your first pregnancy you're 40 or over you have a family history of pre-eclampsia your BMI is 35 or over it's more than 10 years since your last pregnancy (NCCWCH 2011)  Diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) is also more likely if you are expecting more than one baby (NCCWCH 2011, NHS 2014) . Your midwife will ask you about other risk factors, such as family history, for gestational diabetes at your booking appointment. Depending on her assessment, she may refer you for a glucose tolerance test (GTT) , which detects gestational diabetes, later in pregnancy.  Having a GTT is routine if you had a BMI over 30 when you became pregnant. Your midwife will also advise you on things you can change in your lifestyle to help protect you against gestational diabetes. She may ask to weigh you again at 28 weeks, and your team will keep a close eye on how your babies are growing.  You may become low in iron (anaemia) . All mums-to-be can become anaemic, because pregnancy causes the amount of blood flowing in their system to expand and become more diluted (Robson et al 2014) .  This can affect you even more when you're expecting more than one baby (Davies 2014, McAslan Fraser 2012) , making you feel especially tired. Having mild anaemia isn't harmful to your babies. Your body will make sure that your babies get their share of iron before you get yours (Pavord et al 2012) . But to make sure your levels are topped up, your midwife may recommend that you take an iron supplement.  To check your iron stores are not running low, your midwife will offer you an extra blood test when you're between 20 weeks and 24 weeks pregnant (NCCWCH 2011) . All pregnant women routinely have a blood test to check for iron levels at 28 weeks, and to confirm their blood group.   Obstetric cholestasis (OC) is an uncommon condition that affects the liver. It's thought to be caused by the pregnancy hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Because you have higher levels of these hormones, you're more prone to developing OC (McAslan Fraser 2012, RCOG 2011) .  OC causes extreme itching without a rash, which is typically worse at night (RCOG 2011) . Some itching is common in pregnancy, but if you are intensely itchy, particularly on your hands and feet, contact your doctor or midwife straight away (McAslan Fraser 2012) . Which complications may affect my babies? Most twins are born without any lasting problems (NHS 2014) . However, some abnormalities are more common in multiple pregnancies (NCCWCH 2011) .  Structural abnormalities, where a baby's chromosomes don’t develop normally, are twice as common in twins as in single babies (Sperling et al 2007) . Bear in mind that most single babies are born without abnormalities, so it's still unusual for twins to be born with a problem.  When structural anomalies do happen, they're most likely to result in a heart defect (NCCWCH 2011, Sperling et al 2007) . In most cases, multiples' heart problems are in the mild to moderate range, and can be treated by specialist paediatricians (Sperling et al 2007) .  Your midwife will advise you to take 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily for the first 12 weeks of your pregnancy (NICE 2008) . This will help to protect your babies against abnormalities affecting their brain, spine and spinal cord (neural tube defects).  You will have monitoring throughout your pregnancy to check how your babies are growing. Many abnormalities can be spotted in the first trimester, with combined screening (NHS 2015) . Your mid-pregnancy anomaly scan , which you'll have between 18 weeks and 20 weeks plus six days of pregnancy, is another opportunity to review your babies' development (NICE 2008) .  The news that there could be a problem will be the last thing you want to hear. But the sooner it's discovered that one baby or more has an abnormality, the better is their outlook. Then your specialist team can plan any extra care you need during pregnancy (NCCWCH 2011) , and any treatment your babies may need after birth.  It's more common for one or both babies to grow more slowly than expected for your stage of pregnancy. This is called intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Many twins are born small but perfectly healthy. However, your obstetrician will advise caution, as IUGR can make babies more vulnerable to health problems. This could be a reason to plan an early birth by caesarean section (NCCWCH 2011) .   Identical twins who share a placenta (monochorionic) are more likely to experience complications than twins who have a placenta each (dichorionic) (NCCWCH 2011, Skeie et al 2003) .  IUGR may be caused by problems with a shared placenta, one of the placentas or with how the umbilical cord connects to the placenta (Breathnach and Malone 2012) . You'll be offered regular scans to monitor how your babies are growing (NCCWCH 2011) .   Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare but potentially serious complication. It can happen to identical twins or triplets who are monochorionic, when some of the blood connections in the placenta are shared by both babies There's a risk that one baby (the recipient) gets too much blood from the placenta and the other baby (the donor) gets too little.  The donor baby may become smaller and anaemic due to not having enough blood. The recipient baby's higher blood volume may strain his heart.  If your twins or triplets are monochorionic, your medical team will closely monitor your babies for signs of TTTS with frequent ultrasound scans (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) . You can also watch out for these symptoms yourself, which are:   tightness across your belly a feeling that you've increased in size within a day or so TTTS affects up to 15 per cent of monochorionic twins (NCCWCH 2011) . The twins that are most at risk of complications are those that share a placenta and an amniotic sac (monochorionic monoamniotic or MCMA) (NCCWCH 2011, RCOG 2008) .  MCMA twins sometimes get tangled umbilical cords, because they are sharing the same space (RCOG 2008) . If you are expecting MCMA twins, you should be referred to a major hospital for care under a specialist consultant (NCCWCH 2011) . Can I prevent twin pregnancy complications? Early confirmation that you're carrying twins and whether or not they share a placenta will help. This allows your doctor plenty of time to detect, monitor and treat any complications that may arise.  Being fit and healthy may help you to cope better with a twin pregnancy and with any complications that may develop during the birth .  Here are tips for keeping your pregnancy as problem-free as possible:   Go to all your antenatal appointments.  Try to familiarise yourself with these warning signs of pre-eclampsia . Stick to a healthy diet . Stay hydrated (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) . Take gentle exercise such as swimming, Pilates or yoga, if your doctor or midwife says it's OK for you to do so (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) . If you smoke, the best thing you can do for your babies is to quit (McAslan Fraser 2012, NCCWCH 2011) . This is particularly important if your babies share a placenta, because the placenta is already having to work extra hard to provide enough oxygen. Your midwife can refer you for specialist support to help you stop. What are the chances I'll have a premature birth? It’s quite likely. Premature labour and birth , when your babies arrive earlier than expected, is one of the main complications associated with a twin pregnancy.  However, full-term for multiples is earlier than for single babies. While 40 weeks is full-term for a single baby, twins are considered full-term at 37 weeks, and triplets at 35 weeks.  More than half of all twins are born before 37 weeks, and 10 per cent are born before 32 weeks (HSCIC 2015, ISD Scotland 2014) . Those most vulnerable are very premature babies who are born before 30 weeks.  Because twins tend to be born early, there's a chance they'll need to spend time in special care after they're born (NCCWCH 2011) . This affects just under half of parents having twins and almost all those expecting triplets (Tamba 2012) .  You may have to go home while your babies are still in hospital, which can be very hard. The team caring for you will give you lots of support and preparation for going home after the birth if your babies are in SCBU. Is stillbirth more common in twins? Sadly, the number of babies who are stillborn is a little higher for multiple births (NCCWCH 2011) .  Five single babies per 1,000 are lost each year, whereas 12 babies per 1,000 in twin births and 31 babies per 1,000 in triplet births are lost (NCCWCH 2011) . Because premature birth is a common complication, twins or more are more vulnerable in their first month of life, too (NCCWCH 2011) .  To keep your babies as safe as possible, your doctor may recommend that you are offered an early, planned birth. This may be by caesarean or induction (NCCWCH 2011) .  Some babies are more vulnerable than others. Identical twins (monochorionic twins) are slightly more likely to experience problems than dichorionic twins (NCCWCH 2011, Skeie et al 2003) . However, it is a national policy for hospitals to offer planned birth for all multiple pregnancies, whether there are complications or not.

A BabyCentre Member  04/01/18    The implication that dichorionic twins are not identical is false; roughly 15% of same-sex dichorionic twins are identical. I have dichorionic twin girls that are identical. We have had them tested and they are definitely identical, despite having their own chorions and placentas.   Report this           Winifeleti1   22/12/17    I am 41 yo and 28 weeks with triplets, two being monochromic twins. So far Dr is happy with my progress to date. No complications other than swollen feet. But the high risk that is so often placed on this condition can be very hard to deal with or help us be positive. Wish there were more articles out on signs of positive multiple pregnancy and how to have one.

I'm 31+3 days with non-identical twins and every appointment and article are just so negative yet then you are told "try and enjoy your pregnancy!"
I really think there needs to be a culture change, yes we need to know the risks but we also need some positivity around multiples pregnancies and birth!!

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

Dizygotic twins are also known as fraternal or non-identical twins. They are the most common type of twins. Unlike monozygotic twins (also known as identical twins), dizygotic twins do not share the same genes. Monozygotic twins share 100 percent of each other genes. Dizygotic twins share only 50 percent.         This is the same genetic similarity found between siblings conceived and born at different times. Why Might Someone Conceive Dizygotic Twins? Dizygotic twins may occur if two or more oocytes (eggs) are released in one cycle. If each is fertilized, dizygotic twins may result. During IVF treatment , if two or more embryos are transferred, you may also get pregnant with twins (or more.) Fertility drugs are a common cause of dizygotic twins. Depending on which drug or fertility treatment is used, your odds of conceiving twins while taking fertility drugs ranges between 5 and 30 percent. Medications like Clomid and fertility procedures like IUI and IVF are responsible for the majority of twin births in the United States. But fertility drugs aren't the only cause for dizygotic twins. Your odds of conceiving twins may be higher if: The mother is 30 years of age or older The mother is taller than average   You have a family history of twins You're overweight You're African-American Here is more information on your odds of conceiving twins: What Increases Your Chances for Twins Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? What Location and Ethnicity Has to Do With Your Odds for Twins The odds of twins is highly affected by ethnicity and even location.         Those of African ethnicity are most likely to have twins, while Asians are least likely. Europeans fall into the mid-range. However, even within these broad categories, there can be a lot of differentiation. For example... In the United States, the twinning rates in 2003 were found to be 15.8 per 1,000 pregnancies. For Caucasian Americans, the rate was 15.7 per 1,000, while for black Americans, it was higher at 17.2 per 1,000. In Europe, the overall twinning rate in 2003 was 16.4 per 1,000 births. In Luxembourg and Portugal, the twinning rate was 11 in 1,000. Compare that to the twinning rates in Denmark, Greece, and the Netherlands where it was 20 per 1,000 births—almost twice as high. Nigeria has an overall high twinning rate, with an overall dizygotic twinning rate of 40 per 1,000 births. Still, variations are found in different regions. In Western and Eastern Nigeria, twinning rates were between 33 to 66.5 per 1,000 births. In Nothern Nigeria, rates were 19.4 per 1,000 for specific groups. These variations are found for dizygotic twins. But these differences by region and race are not found for monozygotic twins, or identical twins. The rate of identical twins is pretty much constant across all regions, occurring in approximately 4 per 1,000 pregnancies.          Dizygotic Twins and Gender Will you have boy-girl twins, boy-boy twins, or girl-girl twins? Here are your odds: Boy-girl twins are the most common kind of dizygotic twins, occurring 50 percent of the time. Girl-girl twins are the second most common occurrence. Boy-boy twins are the least common. Dizygotic Twins and Their Amniotic Sacs and Placentas Dizygotic twins typically have separate amniotic sacs and placentas. This is known as being dichorionic-diamniotic. (Sometimes called Di-Di for short.) This is the most common set-up for dizygotic twins. Di-Di twins also have the lowest pregnancy risks. Twin Pregnancy Risks for the Mother and Babies  There are rare instances of dizygotic twins who share one placenta. In this case, each has his or her own amniotic sac. This is referred to as monochorionic-diamniotic (Mo-Di for short). The risks are higher for twins sharing a placenta, due to the risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . The pregnancy may be monitored more closely. Because two placentas can fuse over time, it can be difficult to identify via ultrasound whether there are two placentas or one later in the pregnancy. For this reason, your doctor may send you for an ultrasound near the end of the first trimester, when it’s still possible to see the separation of two placentas. Reducing Your Risk of Twins When Using Fertility Treatments There has been an increase in dizygotic twinning in developed countries across the world, and this in large part occurred because of fertility treatment use. For a few decades, twin rates went up and up, until the year 2000, when rates finally started to drop slightly. They reached a peak and started to go down because as fertility treatment technology has advanced, reproductive specialists have found ways to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies. The goal of infertility treatment should always be one healthy baby, one at a time. It's not possible to completely eliminate the risk of twins during fertility treatment, but a few options are available. Using lowest effective dose for fertility treatments : The highest risk for twins occurs during injectable fertility drug use (gonadotropins) along with timed sexual intercourse or insemination. There is no control over how many follicles may develop or become fertilized. However, when doctors use just enough fertility medication to stimulate just one or two follicles, the odds of multiples can be reduced. Of course, if there are two follicles, the risk for twins is higher than if there is just one follicle. Also, if more than one—or a few to several—follicle develop, the doctor can "cancel" the cycle and ask the couple not to have sexual intercourse. Single embryo transfer IVF (SET-IVF) : With in vitro fertilization, the doctor can control how many embryos are transferred back to the uterus. When IVF was newer and less effective, transferring two to four embryos at a time wasn't uncommon. The hope was that at least one will "stick." But sometimes, more than one "stuck." Now, with young and good prognosis patients, single embryo transfer is an option. In this case, only one good quality embryo is transferred. There is still a very low risk of identical twinning. But the higher risk of dizygotic twinning is eliminated. Frozen embryo transfer IVF (FET-IVF) : Improvements in cryopreservation make single embryo transfer a viable option. Ideally, a couple will have more than just one good quality embryo. But what happens to the embryos not transferred? With FET-IVF, the "extra" embryos can be frozen for now. Then, if pregnancy doesn't occur, a future FET-IVF cycle can be tried. If pregnancy does occur with the first embryo transferred, you can keep the cryopreserved embryos "on ice" for future siblings, or they can be donated to another couple or to scientific research. Trizygotic Triplets and Quadrazygotic Quadruplets If three eggs are fertilized by three separate sperm, this may result in trizygotic triplets . If four eggs are fertilized by four separate sperm, you may get quadrazygotic quadruplets. It is also possible for a mother pregnant with high-order multiples to have a combination of twins. For example, triplets may start as nonidentical twins (or dizygotic twins). Then, one of those zygotes splits, leading to a set of identical twins (or monozygotic twins). Altogether, you would have two identical twins and one non-identical twin making up the set of triplets. If you find this hard to understand, try this. Take two pens, one red and one black. Draw a smiley face with the red pen, with a little baby hair on top. Draw another smiley face with the black pen. Now, from the black pen face, draw two lines down and out, each going to a separate new smiley face. In one big circle, draw a line around one of the red faces and two of the black faces. Those are the triplets -- two identical twins (black pen) and one "sibling" twin (red pen). However, the majority of high-order multiples are made up of non-identical twins.

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

These drugs are used to stimulate ovulation. Brand names that may be familiar to you include Gonal-F, Follistim, Ovidrel, Menopur, and Luveris. (More names below.) Gonadotropins are known informally as injectables. They are administered by injection only. (This is different from fertility drugs like Clomid and letrozole , which are pills you take by mouth.)         The naturally occurring hormones in the body FSH and LH are also known as gonadotropins. They play a pivotal role in ovulation . How Do They Work? To better understand how gonadotropins work, you should first understand how the female reproductive system works. Read an easy to understand, step-by-step explanation of the female reproductive cycle here. If you don't have time for that, here's a super quick recap! Normally, your pituitary gland produces FSH and LH at the beginning of your menstrual cycle. The FSH is sent out into the body. LH is stored in the pituitary gland until just before ovulation. FSH tells the follicles in your ovaries to wake up and grow. FSH stands for "follicle stimulating hormone." Makes perfect sense, given it stimulates the follicles ! Gonadotropin fertility drugs, that are FSH or FSH along with LH, act similarly. They tell the follicles on your ovaries to grow and develop.   LH typically peaks just before ovulation during a natural cycle and helps any mature eggs to go through one last growth spurt and release. In other words, ovulate! During treatment with gonadotropins, you may be given either an injection of rLH or, more commonly, hCG . This acts like the natural LH spike and will trigger ovulation.         What to Expect Gonadotropins may be used on their own. They may also be used as part of an IUI treatment or IVF treatment cycle. Below is an explanation of how they may be used on their own. When you get your next period, you'll call your doctor. You'll then have some blood work and an ultrasound. This is to make sure there are no complications or reasons you can't be treated in this cycle. (For example, to ensure you aren't pregnant and don't have a benign ovarian cyst .) Your doctor will likely start you off with 75 to 150 IU of the gonadotropin medication. Depending on which gonadotropin is prescribed, you'll need to give yourself injections just below the skin (subcutaneously) or into the muscle (intramuscularly). Ask your doctor or nurse to demonstrate how to safely perform the injections. They will likely do this without you asking. How to Give Yourself a Subcutaneous Injection How to Give Yourself an IM Injection Over the next several days, your hormone levels, specifically estradiol , and the follicles on your ovaries will be closely monitored. This monitoring happens via blood work and ultrasound every few days. How often? That will depend on your doctor's protocol, how you're responding to the drugs, and how close you are to ovulation.         Your medications may be adjusted up or down depending on the ultrasound and hormone results. The goal is to stimulate the ovaries enough to produce one good egg, but not to overstimulate them. Other stimulation can increase your risks of a multiple pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). When your hormone levels and follicle size indicate ovulation is close, your doctor may order an injection of hCG. This is also known as the " trigger shot ." It triggers ovulation to occur approximately 36 hours later. Your doctor should also tell you which days to have intercourse, so you can"catch" the egg and get pregnant!  How to Cope with Doctor Prescribed Conception Sex During Treatment Once ovulation occurs, you may then start taking progesterone . Not everyone will need this, however. Your hormone levels will continue to be monitored, though less frequently. You'll take a pregnancy test at the end of the cycle to determine if treatment was successful. Sometimes, treatment may be canceled in the middle. This may occur before the trigger shot or even earlier. The most common reason for cycle cancellation is your doctor suspects the ovaries have been hyperstimulated. Stopping the medications can avoid a serious case of OHSS and high-order multiples. Your doctor may also tell you to refrain from intercourse. As difficult as it is to hear this, it's very important you follow your doctor's instructions. Pregnancy can increase the chances of a high-order pregnancy, which puts you and your babies at risk. Also, if you develop OHSS, pregnancy can complicate your recovery. Different Types There are two basic types of gonadotropins: recombinant gonadotropins and urinary-extracted gonadotropins. Recombinant gonadotropins are created in a laboratory using recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant FSH gonadotropins on the market include Gonal-F and Follistim. Currently, Luveris is the only recombinant LH gonadotropin available. Urinary-extracted gonadotropins are extracted and purified from the urine of postmenopausal women. (Their urine is naturally high in FSH.) They include human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), purified FSH and highly purified FSH. Purified urine-extracted FSH gonadotropins include Bravelle and Fertinex. Human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) contains FSH and LH. It includes medications like Humegon, Menogon, Pergonal and Repronex. Menopur is a highly purified hMG. A related drug, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often part of fertility treatment with gonadotropin injections . You may know hCG as the pregnancy hormone , but it also happens to be molecularly similar to LH. In a natural cycle, LH triggers ovulation . As part of fertility treatment , an injection of hCG may be used to trigger ovulation. Ovidrel, Novarel, Pregnyl and Profasi are brand names for hCG injectables. Associated Risks Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially serious complication of gonadotropin therapy. Mild OHSS occurs in 10% to 20% of women taking gonadotropins. Serious OHSS occurs 1% of the time. Serious OHSS can be deadly if ignored or not treated properly. It's important you are familiar with the symptoms. OHSS Symptoms and Treatment Another possible risk factor of gonadotropin therapy is a multiple pregnancy. Some studies have found that up to 30% of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins are twins or more. (This is compared to just 1% to 2% of naturally conceived pregnancies.) Most multiple pregnancies with gonadotropins are twins. Up to 5% are triplets or more. Multiple pregnancies , including twin pregnancies , are risky for the mother and the babies. Close monitoring of a treatment cycle can help prevent a multiple pregnancy. Many doctors will cancel if more than three follicles develop or if estradiol levels are very high. Some studies have been able to get the rate of multiples pregnancies as low as 5%. They have done this by starting at a low dose, using slow increases only when necessary and close monitoring. Twin Pregnancy Risks Should I Get Pregnant with Twins on Purpose? Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? The risk of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage is higher with gonadotropin-conceived pregnancies. Less than 1% of women taking gonadotropins will experience adnexal torsion, or ovarian twisting. This is when the ovary twists on itself and cuts off its own blood supply. Surgery is necessary to untwist or possibly remove the affected ovary. Your risk of pregnancy complications -- like pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and placental abruption -- may be slightly increased as compared to a naturally conceived pregnancy. Whether this is caused by the gonadotropins or the infertility is unclear. Because gonadotropins are injectable medications, you may also experience soreness near the injection sites. If you suspect an infection, be sure to alert your doctor right away. Side Effects and Risks of Gonadotropins What Are the Success Rates? Your potential for pregnancy success with gonadotropins will depend on a variety of factors, including your age and the cause of infertility. A 2011 study by The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine looked at 1,400 gonadotropin treatment cycles. The overall pregnancy rate was 12%, with the live birth rate about 7.7%. Younger patients had higher live birth rates. In this study, by canceling the cycle if three or more dominant follicles developed or estradiol levels were higher than 1500 pg/ml, they were able to keep the multiple pregnancy rate a low 2.6%. Older studies have found higher pregnancy rates with gonadotropins than this one. However, it's possible the higher success rate came at the expense of higher risk for OHSS and multiple pregnancy. Cost of Treatment Gonadotropin treatment that is not an IUI or IVF cycle can cost anywhere between $500 to $5,000. The higher price takes into account blood work and ultrasound monitoring. Also, the price varies because different women will need different amounts of drugs. Your insurance company may pay for part of treatment. Or, they may pay for all of it... or none of it. You may need to pay your fertility clinic in full first. Then, you may need to file for a refund from your insurance yourself, or the clinic may handle the insurance claims for you. Be sure to clarify all of this with your fertility clinic before you start treatment. You don't want to be surprised by a high bill at the end.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: October 2016     Are multiple pregnancies riskier than single pregnancies? While the great majority of multiple pregnancies result in healthy babies, any pregnancy with twins or more is considered high risk. And the more babies you're carrying, the higher your risk of complications. The greatest risk is that you'll deliver the babies prematurely , which increases their chances of health problems.  What are the chances that I'll deliver prematurely? According to the March of Dimes, close to 60 percent of all twins and more than 90 percent of triplets are born prematurely (before 37 weeks). The average twin pregnancy lasts 35 weeks. Triplet pregnancies average 33 weeks, and quad pregnancies average 29 weeks.  What are the risks of premature birth? Babies born before their time may not be completely ready for the outside world. Their lungs, brain, and other organs may not be fully developed, their immune system may not be ready to fight off infections, and they may not be able to suck or swallow. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the risks. Premature babies born between 34 and 37 weeks generally do very well. Babies born before 28 weeks may survive, but they'll need intensive medical care and a little luck. If you go into labor before 34 weeks, your medical team may be able to delay your labor for a few days. They'll use this extra time to treat your babies with corticosteroids , drugs that help a baby's lungs and other organs develop faster to greatly increase the chances of survival. Your babies may also receive magnesium sulfate, which helps reduce the risk that they'll develop cerebral palsy.  What are other potential complications of having multiples? Aside from preterm labor, there are several possible problems: Twins and triplets often don't have a chance to reach a healthy weight before they're born. While the average single baby weighs 7 pounds at birth, the average twin weighs 5.5 pounds. Triplets typically weigh 4 pounds each, and quads weigh 3 pounds each. Babies born at under 5.5 pounds are considered to have a low birth weight. Babies with low birth weights are likely to have health problems even if they weren't born prematurely. Low-birth-weight babies often have trouble breathing on their own. They may not be fully prepared to fight infections, control their body temperature, or put on weight. For these reasons, almost all low-birth weight babies have to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit before going home. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, or kidney or liver abnormalities. It develops in roughly 10 to 15 percent of women carrying twins, two to three times the rate of women carrying one baby. The condition tends to develop earlier as well. And once it starts, it can be especially severe. When preeclampsia is severe, it can affect many of your organs and your placenta and cause serious or even life-threatening problems. Gestational diabetes is more common in women carrying more than one baby. If you develop gestational diabetes, your practitioner will monitor you closely. You'll most likely be able to keep your blood sugar levels under control with diet and exercise, but some women will require insulin shots or pills as well. Poorly controlled diabetes can have serious consequences for you and your babies. Placental abruption , when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, is also more likely when you're carrying more than one baby. It can happen any time in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to growth problems, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. In multiple pregnancies, abruption may occur just after the first baby has been delivered vaginally. Once abruption has occurred, the other baby or babies may have to be delivered by cesarean section. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication that occurs in identical twins when blood flows from one baby to the other through their shared placenta. According to the March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of identical twins develop the syndrome. The condition can be treated by using laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies' blood vessels.  Will I be put on bedrest? Your practitioner may put you on bedrest , especially if you develop complications such as preterm labor. There's no proof that bedrest can actually prevent premature delivery for women carrying multiple babies, but there are some situations where it may be beneficial to reduce your physical activity or take frequent breaks off your feet. If your practitioner recommends it, ask her to discuss the pros and cons with you. Also, find out exactly what you can and can't do and for how long. Bedrest can mean anything from curtailing your activities to literally not getting out of bed for any reason. Even if your pregnancy is going smoothly, most doctors and midwives advise taking it easy beginning early in the third trimester. Prepare yourself with a list of questions to ask about bedrest so you'll know exactly what to expect.   What are the chances that I'll lose one or more of the babies? When a woman is carrying twins, one baby might miscarry early in pregnancy while the other stays in place. This situation — called a vanishing twin — occurs in about 20 percent of all twin pregnancies. If you're carrying triplets, there's a 40 percent chance that one or more will miscarry in the first half of pregnancy. In the days before ultrasound, these miscarriages went largely unnoticed. The only symptom is vaginal bleeding, and the remaining baby (or babies) usually develops normally. Stillbirths — the loss of a baby after 20 weeks — are slightly more common in multiple pregnancies, but they're still rare. Only about 1 to 2 percent of twins or triplets are stillborn, compared with about 0.5 percent of singletons. Some babies are lost at the end of a pregnancy and are delivered along with the surviving baby. In rare cases, a stillborn twin can be delivered several weeks before the surviving twin. If you're carrying identical twins who are sharing a placenta, the loss of one twin after the 20th week can be very dangerous to the surviving baby. If your babies don't share a placenta, there's a good chance that your remaining baby can develop normally. In either case, your practitioner will likely take a "watch and see" approach. If your remaining baby isn't in immediate distress, there's usually no reason to induce delivery early.  What can I do to reduce my risk of problems? While many complications of twin pregnancies have little to do with your behavior or lifestyle, getting early confirmation that you are indeed carrying twins will give your healthcare provider plenty of time to catch and treat any complications that may crop up. Educate yourself about the most common risks and complications of twin pregnancies, but don't obsess about all the things that can go wrong. Become familiar with the warning signs of preterm labor. Make sure you are well nourished and well hydrated . Finally, don't miss any prenatal appointments and make sure to follow your provider's instructions.

Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: October 2016     Are multiple pregnancies riskier than single pregnancies? While the great majority of multiple pregnancies result in healthy babies, any pregnancy with twins or more is considered high risk. And the more babies you're carrying, the higher your risk of complications. The greatest risk is that you'll deliver the babies prematurely , which increases their chances of health problems.  What are the chances that I'll deliver prematurely? According to the March of Dimes, close to 60 percent of all twins and more than 90 percent of triplets are born prematurely (before 37 weeks). The average twin pregnancy lasts 35 weeks. Triplet pregnancies average 33 weeks, and quad pregnancies average 29 weeks.  What are the risks of premature birth? Babies born before their time may not be completely ready for the outside world. Their lungs, brain, and other organs may not be fully developed, their immune system may not be ready to fight off infections, and they may not be able to suck or swallow. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the risks. Premature babies born between 34 and 37 weeks generally do very well. Babies born before 28 weeks may survive, but they'll need intensive medical care and a little luck. If you go into labor before 34 weeks, your medical team may be able to delay your labor for a few days. They'll use this extra time to treat your babies with corticosteroids , drugs that help a baby's lungs and other organs develop faster to greatly increase the chances of survival. Your babies may also receive magnesium sulfate, which helps reduce the risk that they'll develop cerebral palsy.  What are other potential complications of having multiples? Aside from preterm labor, there are several possible problems: Twins and triplets often don't have a chance to reach a healthy weight before they're born. While the average single baby weighs 7 pounds at birth, the average twin weighs 5.5 pounds. Triplets typically weigh 4 pounds each, and quads weigh 3 pounds each. Babies born at under 5.5 pounds are considered to have a low birth weight. Babies with low birth weights are likely to have health problems even if they weren't born prematurely. Low-birth-weight babies often have trouble breathing on their own. They may not be fully prepared to fight infections, control their body temperature, or put on weight. For these reasons, almost all low-birth weight babies have to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit before going home. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, or kidney or liver abnormalities. It develops in roughly 10 to 15 percent of women carrying twins, two to three times the rate of women carrying one baby. The condition tends to develop earlier as well. And once it starts, it can be especially severe. When preeclampsia is severe, it can affect many of your organs and your placenta and cause serious or even life-threatening problems. Gestational diabetes is more common in women carrying more than one baby. If you develop gestational diabetes, your practitioner will monitor you closely. You'll most likely be able to keep your blood sugar levels under control with diet and exercise, but some women will require insulin shots or pills as well. Poorly controlled diabetes can have serious consequences for you and your babies. Placental abruption , when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, is also more likely when you're carrying more than one baby. It can happen any time in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to growth problems, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. In multiple pregnancies, abruption may occur just after the first baby has been delivered vaginally. Once abruption has occurred, the other baby or babies may have to be delivered by cesarean section. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication that occurs in identical twins when blood flows from one baby to the other through their shared placenta. According to the March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of identical twins develop the syndrome. The condition can be treated by using laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies' blood vessels.  Will I be put on bedrest? Your practitioner may put you on bedrest , especially if you develop complications such as preterm labor. There's no proof that bedrest can actually prevent premature delivery for women carrying multiple babies, but there are some situations where it may be beneficial to reduce your physical activity or take frequent breaks off your feet. If your practitioner recommends it, ask her to discuss the pros and cons with you. Also, find out exactly what you can and can't do and for how long. Bedrest can mean anything from curtailing your activities to literally not getting out of bed for any reason. Even if your pregnancy is going smoothly, most doctors and midwives advise taking it easy beginning early in the third trimester. Prepare yourself with a list of questions to ask about bedrest so you'll know exactly what to expect.   What are the chances that I'll lose one or more of the babies? When a woman is carrying twins, one baby might miscarry early in pregnancy while the other stays in place. This situation — called a vanishing twin — occurs in about 20 percent of all twin pregnancies. If you're carrying triplets, there's a 40 percent chance that one or more will miscarry in the first half of pregnancy. In the days before ultrasound, these miscarriages went largely unnoticed. The only symptom is vaginal bleeding, and the remaining baby (or babies) usually develops normally. Stillbirths — the loss of a baby after 20 weeks — are slightly more common in multiple pregnancies, but they're still rare. Only about 1 to 2 percent of twins or triplets are stillborn, compared with about 0.5 percent of singletons. Some babies are lost at the end of a pregnancy and are delivered along with the surviving baby. In rare cases, a stillborn twin can be delivered several weeks before the surviving twin. If you're carrying identical twins who are sharing a placenta, the loss of one twin after the 20th week can be very dangerous to the surviving baby. If your babies don't share a placenta, there's a good chance that your remaining baby can develop normally. In either case, your practitioner will likely take a "watch and see" approach. If your remaining baby isn't in immediate distress, there's usually no reason to induce delivery early.  What can I do to reduce my risk of problems? While many complications of twin pregnancies have little to do with your behavior or lifestyle, getting early confirmation that you are indeed carrying twins will give your healthcare provider plenty of time to catch and treat any complications that may crop up. Educate yourself about the most common risks and complications of twin pregnancies, but don't obsess about all the things that can go wrong. Become familiar with the warning signs of preterm labor. Make sure you are well nourished and well hydrated . Finally, don't miss any prenatal appointments and make sure to follow your provider's instructions.

Placental abruption , when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, is also more likely when you're carrying more than one baby. It can happen any time in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to growth problems, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. In multiple pregnancies, abruption may occur just after the first baby has been delivered vaginally. Once abruption has occurred, the other baby or babies may have to be delivered by cesarean section. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication that occurs in identical twins when blood flows from one baby to the other through their shared placenta. According to the March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of identical twins develop the syndrome. The condition can be treated by using laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies' blood vessels.  Will I be put on bedrest? Your practitioner may put you on bedrest , especially if you develop complications such as preterm labor. There's no proof that bedrest can actually prevent premature delivery for women carrying multiple babies, but there are some situations where it may be beneficial to reduce your physical activity or take frequent breaks off your feet. If your practitioner recommends it, ask her to discuss the pros and cons with you. Also, find out exactly what you can and can't do and for how long. Bedrest can mean anything from curtailing your activities to literally not getting out of bed for any reason. Even if your pregnancy is going smoothly, most doctors and midwives advise taking it easy beginning early in the third trimester. Prepare yourself with a list of questions to ask about bedrest so you'll know exactly what to expect.   What are the chances that I'll lose one or more of the babies? When a woman is carrying twins, one baby might miscarry early in pregnancy while the other stays in place. This situation — called a vanishing twin — occurs in about 20 percent of all twin pregnancies. If you're carrying triplets, there's a 40 percent chance that one or more will miscarry in the first half of pregnancy. In the days before ultrasound, these miscarriages went largely unnoticed. The only symptom is vaginal bleeding, and the remaining baby (or babies) usually develops normally. Stillbirths — the loss of a baby after 20 weeks — are slightly more common in multiple pregnancies, but they're still rare. Only about 1 to 2 percent of twins or triplets are stillborn, compared with about 0.5 percent of singletons. Some babies are lost at the end of a pregnancy and are delivered along with the surviving baby. In rare cases, a stillborn twin can be delivered several weeks before the surviving twin. If you're carrying identical twins who are sharing a placenta, the loss of one twin after the 20th week can be very dangerous to the surviving baby. If your babies don't share a placenta, there's a good chance that your remaining baby can develop normally. In either case, your practitioner will likely take a "watch and see" approach. If your remaining baby isn't in immediate distress, there's usually no reason to induce delivery early.  What can I do to reduce my risk of problems? While many complications of twin pregnancies have little to do with your behavior or lifestyle, getting early confirmation that you are indeed carrying twins will give your healthcare provider plenty of time to catch and treat any complications that may crop up. Educate yourself about the most common risks and complications of twin pregnancies, but don't obsess about all the things that can go wrong. Become familiar with the warning signs of preterm labor. Make sure you are well nourished and well hydrated . Finally, don't miss any prenatal appointments and make sure to follow your provider's instructions.

Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: October 2016     Are multiple pregnancies riskier than single pregnancies? While the great majority of multiple pregnancies result in healthy babies, any pregnancy with twins or more is considered high risk. And the more babies you're carrying, the higher your risk of complications. The greatest risk is that you'll deliver the babies prematurely , which increases their chances of health problems.  What are the chances that I'll deliver prematurely? According to the March of Dimes, close to 60 percent of all twins and more than 90 percent of triplets are born prematurely (before 37 weeks). The average twin pregnancy lasts 35 weeks. Triplet pregnancies average 33 weeks, and quad pregnancies average 29 weeks.  What are the risks of premature birth? Babies born before their time may not be completely ready for the outside world. Their lungs, brain, and other organs may not be fully developed, their immune system may not be ready to fight off infections, and they may not be able to suck or swallow. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the risks. Premature babies born between 34 and 37 weeks generally do very well. Babies born before 28 weeks may survive, but they'll need intensive medical care and a little luck. If you go into labor before 34 weeks, your medical team may be able to delay your labor for a few days. They'll use this extra time to treat your babies with corticosteroids , drugs that help a baby's lungs and other organs develop faster to greatly increase the chances of survival. Your babies may also receive magnesium sulfate, which helps reduce the risk that they'll develop cerebral palsy.  What are other potential complications of having multiples? Aside from preterm labor, there are several possible problems: Twins and triplets often don't have a chance to reach a healthy weight before they're born. While the average single baby weighs 7 pounds at birth, the average twin weighs 5.5 pounds. Triplets typically weigh 4 pounds each, and quads weigh 3 pounds each. Babies born at under 5.5 pounds are considered to have a low birth weight. Babies with low birth weights are likely to have health problems even if they weren't born prematurely. Low-birth-weight babies often have trouble breathing on their own. They may not be fully prepared to fight infections, control their body temperature, or put on weight. For these reasons, almost all low-birth weight babies have to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit before going home. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, or kidney or liver abnormalities. It develops in roughly 10 to 15 percent of women carrying twins, two to three times the rate of women carrying one baby. The condition tends to develop earlier as well. And once it starts, it can be especially severe. When preeclampsia is severe, it can affect many of your organs and your placenta and cause serious or even life-threatening problems. Gestational diabetes is more common in women carrying more than one baby. If you develop gestational diabetes, your practitioner will monitor you closely. You'll most likely be able to keep your blood sugar levels under control with diet and exercise, but some women will require insulin shots or pills as well. Poorly controlled diabetes can have serious consequences for you and your babies. Placental abruption , when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, is also more likely when you're carrying more than one baby. It can happen any time in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to growth problems, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. In multiple pregnancies, abruption may occur just after the first baby has been delivered vaginally. Once abruption has occurred, the other baby or babies may have to be delivered by cesarean section. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious complication that occurs in identical twins when blood flows from one baby to the other through their shared placenta. According to the March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of identical twins develop the syndrome. The condition can be treated by using laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies' blood vessels.  Will I be put on bedrest? Your practitioner may put you on bedrest , especially if you develop complications such as preterm labor. There's no proof that bedrest can actually prevent premature delivery for women carrying multiple babies, but there are some situations where it may be beneficial to reduce your physical activity or take frequent breaks off your feet. If your practitioner recommends it, ask her to discuss the pros and cons with you. Also, find out exactly what you can and can't do and for how long. Bedrest can mean anything from curtailing your activities to literally not getting out of bed for any reason. Even if your pregnancy is going smoothly, most doctors and midwives advise taking it easy beginning early in the third trimester. Prepare yourself with a list of questions to ask about bedrest so you'll know exactly what to expect.   What are the chances that I'll lose one or more of the babies? When a woman is carrying twins, one baby might miscarry early in pregnancy while the other stays in place. This situation — called a vanishing twin — occurs in about 20 percent of all twin pregnancies. If you're carrying triplets, there's a 40 percent chance that one or more will miscarry in the first half of pregnancy. In the days before ultrasound, these miscarriages went largely unnoticed. The only symptom is vaginal bleeding, and the remaining baby (or babies) usually develops normally. Stillbirths — the loss of a baby after 20 weeks — are slightly more common in multiple pregnancies, but they're still rare. Only about 1 to 2 percent of twins or triplets are stillborn, compared with about 0.5 percent of singletons. Some babies are lost at the end of a pregnancy and are delivered along with the surviving baby. In rare cases, a stillborn twin can be delivered several weeks before the surviving twin. If you're carrying identical twins who are sharing a placenta, the loss of one twin after the 20th week can be very dangerous to the surviving baby. If your babies don't share a placenta, there's a good chance that your remaining baby can develop normally. In either case, your practitioner will likely take a "watch and see" approach. If your remaining baby isn't in immediate distress, there's usually no reason to induce delivery early.  What can I do to reduce my risk of problems? While many complications of twin pregnancies have little to do with your behavior or lifestyle, getting early confirmation that you are indeed carrying twins will give your healthcare provider plenty of time to catch and treat any complications that may crop up. Educate yourself about the most common risks and complications of twin pregnancies, but don't obsess about all the things that can go wrong. Become familiar with the warning signs of preterm labor. Make sure you are well nourished and well hydrated . Finally, don't miss any prenatal appointments and make sure to follow your provider's instructions.

So… the odds aren’t exactly with you. Or are they? Turns out, there are a number of factors that can affect your odds of getting pregnant with multiples and having twin babies. These include your age, diet, number of pregnancies you’ve had, ethnicity, location, body type, and more. So what are your chancing of having twins or multiples? Take our just-for-fun quiz to find out instantly!  1. Do you have fraternal twins in your family?  Not that I know of  Yes, on my dad’s side  Yes, on my mom’s side  Yes, more than one set on my mom’s side 2. Are you overweight and/or taller than average?  Yes  No 3. What is your ethnicity?  Nigerian  African  Caucasian  Hispanic or Asian  Other 4. Where do you live?  Nigeria  Central Africa  North America or Europe  Latin America or Asia  Other 5. Do you eat a high fat diet?  Yep, full fat pastured yogurt, coconut oil, and pastured bacon  Yes, but it mostly comes from conventional animal products  I try to limit my consumption of fat 6. Do you frequently eat large amounts of phytoestrogen foods such as soy, tempeh, flax, sesame seeds, oats, barley, dried beans, lentils, yams, alfalfa, and mung beans?  Yes, I eat large servings of those foods daily  Sure, but not daily  No, I hardly ever eat those foods 7. How old are you?  Under 35  35-39  Over 40 8. How many full-term pregnancies have you had (including your current pregnancy)?  This is my first  2  3  4+ 9. Did you use fertility treatments to conceive?  Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I am told you will need to eat more but when does that start? There does not seem to be a lot of information on twins and how you deal with health and changes over a single birth! I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

You may need to go to extra prenatal care checkups so your health care provider can check you and your babies closely during pregnancy.  The most common complication of being pregnant with multiples is premature birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy).       What causes you to get pregnant with multiples?  A multiple pregnancy (being pregnant with multiples) means you’re pregnant with more than one baby. If you’re pregnant with higher-order multiples, it means you’re pregnant with three or more babies.  Multiple pregnancy usually happens when more than one egg is fertilized by a man’s sperm. But it also can happen when one egg is fertilized and then splits into two or more embryos that grow into two or more babies.  Twins are called identical when one fertilized egg splits into two. Identical twins look almost exactly alike and share the exact same genes. Twins are fraternal when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm. Fraternal twins don’t share the same genes and are no more alike than any brothers and sisters from different pregnancies with the same mother and father.  Most babies are singleton babies. This means you’re pregnant with just one baby. But more women are getting pregnant with multiples now than in the past. This is mostly because more women are having babies later in life, and you’re more likely to have multiples if you’re older than 30 . Also, more women are using fertility treatment to get pregnant. Fertility treatment is medical treatment to help women get pregnant.  How do you know if you’re pregnant with multiples?  You may be pregnant with multiples if:   Your breasts are very sore.  You’re very hungry or you gain weight quickly in the first trimester.  You feel movement in different parts of your belly at the same time.  You have severe morning sickness . Morning sickness is nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting that happens in the first few months of pregnancy, usually in the first few months. It’s sometimes called nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or NVP.  Your health care provider hears more than one heartbeat or finds that your uterus (womb) is larger than usual. The uterus is the place inside you where your baby grows.  You have high levels of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin (also called hCG) or a protein called alpha-fetoprotein in your blood. HCG is a hormone your body makes during pregnancy. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein that a developing baby makes during pregnancy.   Your provider uses ultrasound to find out for sure if you’re pregnant with multiples. Ultrasound uses sound waves and a computer screen to show a picture of a baby in the womb.  What kind of prenatal care do you need if you’re pregnant with multiples?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, you may need extra medical care during pregnancy, labor and birth . You may need to go to extra prenatal care checkups so your provider can watch you and your babies for problems. You also may need more prenatal tests (like ultrasounds) to check on your growing babies throughout your pregnancy.  If you’ve had pregnancy complications in the past or if you have health conditions that put you at risk for pregnancy complications, your provider may refer you to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist. This is a doctor with education and training to take care of women who have high-risk pregnancies. High-risk means you’re more likely than most pregnant women to have problems with your pregnancy. If you’re referred to this kind of doctor, it doesn’t mean you’ll have problems during pregnancy. It just means he can check you and your babies closely to help prevent or treat any conditions that may happen.  How can a multiple pregnancy affect your health?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, you’re more likely than if you were pregnant with one baby to have complications, including:   Preterm labor. This is labor that happens too early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm labor can lead to premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy).  Anemia. Anemia is when you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the rest of your body. You may have anemia if your body isn’t getting enough iron. A condition called iron-deficiency anemia is common in multiple pregnancies and can increase your chances of premature birth. Your provider may prescribe an iron supplement for you to make sure you’re getting enough iron.  Gestational diabetes. This is a kind of diabetes that only pregnant women can get. If untreated, it can cause serious health problems for you and your babies. Diabetes is when you have too much sugar (called blood sugar or glucose) in your blood.  Gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. These are types of high blood pressure that only pregnant women can get. High blood pressure is when the force of blood against the walls of your blood vessels is too high. It can cause problems during pregnancy. Preeclampsia is a condition that can happen after the 20th week of pregnancy or right after pregnancy. It’s when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and signs that some of her organs, like her kidneys and liver, may not be working properly.  Hyperemesis gravidarum. This is a severe kind of morning sickness or nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (also called NVP).  Polyhydramnios. This is when you have too much amniotic fluid . Amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds your baby in your uterus (womb).  Miscarriage or stillbirth. Miscarriage is when a baby dies in the womb before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Stillbirth is when a baby dies in the womb after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Some women who are pregnant with multiples have a condition called vanishing twin syndrome. This is when one or more babies die in the womb, but one baby survives.   If you’re having multiples, you’re more likely to have these complications after giving birth:   Postpartum depression (also called PPD). This is a kind of depression that some women get after having a baby. PPD is strong feelings of sadness that last for a long time. These feelings can make it hard for you to take care of your baby.  Postpartum hemorrhage. This is heavy bleeding after giving birth. It’s a serious but rare condition.   How can being pregnant with multiples affect your babies’ health?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, your babies are more likely to have health complications, including:   Premature birth.  Premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) may have more health problems or need to stay in the hospital longer than babies born later. Some may spend time in a hospital’s newborn intensive care unit (also called NICU). This is the part of a hospital that takes care of sick babies. Premature babies also may have long-term health problems that can affect their whole lives. More than half of twins and nearly all triplets and other higher-order multiples are born prematurely. The earlier in pregnancy your babies are born, the more likely they are to have health problems.  Birth defects. Birth defects are health conditions that are present at birth. They change the shape or function of one or more parts of the body. Birth defects can cause problems in overall health, how the body develops or how the body works. Multiples are about twice as likely as singleton babies to have birth defects, including neural tube defects (like spina bifida ), cerebral palsy , congenital heart defects and birth defects that affect the digestive system. The digestive system helps your baby’s body process food.  Growth problems. Multiples are usually smaller than singleton babies. Your provider can use ultrasound to check your babies’ growth at prenatal care checkups. When one twin is much smaller than the other, they’re called discordant twins. Discordant twins are more likely to have health problems during pregnancy and after birth.  Low birthweight (also called LBW). This is when your baby is born weighing less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces. Babies with LBW are more likely than babies born at a normal weight to have certain health problems, like retinopathy of prematurity . They’re also more likely to have health problems later in life, like high blood pressure. More than half of twins and nearly all higher order multiples are born with LBW.  Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (also called TTTS). This condition happens when identical twins share a placenta and one baby gets too much blood flow, while the other baby doesn’t get enough. The placenta grows in your uterus (womb) and supplies your babies with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord. TTTS can be treated with laser surgery to seal off the connection between the babies’ blood vessels and amniocentesis (also called amnio) to drain off extra fluid.  Neonatal death. This is when a baby dies in the first 28 days of life. Premature birth is the most common cause of neonatal death.   Are you more likely than other women to get pregnant with multiples?  You may be more likely than other women to get pregnant with more than one baby if:   You have fertility treatment. If you’re having fertility treatment, it’s important to try to get pregnant with just one baby. For example, if you’re having a treatment called in vitro fertilization (also called IVF), you can have just one embryo placed in your uterus. This is called single embryo transfer (also called SET). In IVF, an egg and sperm are combined in a lab to create an embryo (fertilized egg) which is then put into your uterus. If you’re having any kind of fertility treatment, talk to your provider about ways to help lower your chances of getting pregnant with multiples.  You’re in your 30s, especially your late 30s. If you’re 30 or older, you’re more likely than younger women to release more than one egg during a menstrual cycle (also called your period).  You have a family history of multiples. Family history is a record of health conditions and treatments that you, your partner and everyone in your families has had. If you or other women in your family have had fraternal twins, you may be more likely to have twins, too. You’re also more likely to have multiples if you’ve been pregnant before, especially if you’ve been pregnant with multiples.  You’re obese . If you're obese, you have an excess amount of body fat and your body mass index (also called BMI) is 30 or higher. To find out your BMI, go to cdc.gov/bmi .  You’re black or Caucasian. Black women are more likely to have twins than other women. Caucasian women, especially those older than 35 years old, are most likely to have higher-order multiples.   How are multiples born?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, you’re more likely to have a cesarean birth (also called c-section) than if you’re pregnant with one baby. A c-section is surgery in which your baby is born through a cut that your doctor makes in your belly and uterus. Most triplets and higher-order multiples are born by c-section.  If you’re pregnant with twins, you may need a c-section if neither baby is in the head-down position or if you have other complications. You may be able to have a vaginal birth if:   Both babies are in the head-down position and you have no other complications  The lower twin is in the head-down position but the higher twin isn’t.   Vaginal birth is the way most babies are born. During vaginal birth, the uterus (womb) contracts to help push the baby out through the vagina.  Do you need to eat special foods if you’re pregnant with multiples?  No. But you do need more of certain nutrients, like folic acid , protein, iron and calcium. You can get the right amount of these nutrients by eating healthy foods and taking your prenatal vitamin every day. Prenatal vitamins are multivitamins made just for pregnant women. Compared to a regular multivitamin, they have more of some nutrients that you need during pregnancy. Your provider can prescribe a prenatal vitamin for you at your first prenatal care checkup. Even when you’re pregnant with multiples, you only need to take one prenatal vitamin each day.  How much weight should you gain if you’re pregnant with multiples?  If you’re pregnant with multiples, you need to gain more weight than if you were pregnant one baby. The amount of weight to gain depends on your weight before pregnancy and how many babies you have. Talk to your provider about how much weight to gain.  Here’s what you should know about gaining weight if you’re pregnant with twins:   If you were at a healthy weight before pregnancy, you want to gain about 37 to 54 pounds during pregnancy.  If you were overweight before pregnancy, you want to gain about 31 to 50 pounds during pregnancy.  If you were obese before pregnancy, you want to gain about 25 to 42 pounds during pregnancy.   Do you need to limit physical activity if you’re pregnant with multiples?  Talk to your provider about what kind of activities are safe for you to do. You may need to cut out any high-impact activities, like aerobics or jogging, that make you jump or put stress on your joints.
