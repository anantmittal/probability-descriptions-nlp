from https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/Math_p007/pure-mathematics/birthday-paradox  Last edit date: 2017-07-28   Introduction  The birthday paradox , also known as the birthday problem, states that in a random gathering of 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two people will have the same birthday. Is this really true?  Due to probability , sometimes an event is more likely to occur than we believe it to, especially when our own viewpoint affects how we analyze a situation.  For example, one reason why the birthday paradox seems like a paradox is that when in a room with 22 other people, if a person compares his or her birthday with the birthdays of the other people it would make for only 22 comparisons, or, in other words, only 22 chances for people to share the same birthday. But when all 23 birthdays are compared against each other, it makes for much more than 22 comparisons.  How much more?  While the first person has 22 comparisons to make, the second person was already compared to the first person, so there are only 21 comparisons to make.  The third person then has 20 comparisons, the fourth person has 19 comparisons, and so on.  If you add up all possible comparisons (22 + 21 + 20 + 19 ... + 1) the sum is 253 comparisons, or combinations.  Consequently, each group of 23 people involves 253 comparisons, or 253 chances for matching birthdays. But how do 253 comparisons lead to a 50% chance of two people having the same birthday?  Check out the resources in the Bibliography below to help you find out how!  In this science fair project, you will investigate whether the birthday paradox holds true by looking at several random groups of 23 or more people.  Will 50% of the groups include at least two people with the same birthday, making the birthday paradox hold true?  Terms and Concepts   Birthday paradox  Probability   Questions   What is the probability that a coin flipped will land "heads"?  What is the probability that a coin flipped three times in a row will land "heads" each time?  What are the odds that two people share the same birthday in a group of 366 people?  ( Hint : 366 is the greatest number of days a year can have.)  If 253 unique comparisons can be made between 23 people, how does this lead to a 50% chance of two people in a group of 23 having the same birthday?

See the Experimental Procedure  Lab notebook   Remember Your Display Board Supplies       Poster Making Kit        ArtSkills Trifold with Header        Poster Lights             Experimental Procedure   First you will need to collect birthdays for random groups of 23 or more people. Ideally you would like to get 10-12 groups of 23 or more people so you have enough different groups to compare. (You do not need the year for the birthdays, just the month and day.) Here are a couple of ways that you can find a number of randomly grouped people:  Most schools have around 25 students in a class, so ask a teacher from each grade at your school to pass a list around each of his/her classes to collect the birthdays for students in each of his/her classes.  Use the birthdays of players on major league baseball teams. ( Note: This information can easily be found on the internet). Alternatively, use the birthdays of other random people using online sources.   For each group of 23 or more birthdays that you collected, sort through all the them to see if there are any birthday matches in each group. How many of your groups have two or more people with the same birthday? Based on the birthday paradox, how many groups would you expect to find that have two people with the same birthday? Did the birthday paradox hold true?

If you like this project, you might enjoy exploring these related careers:       Statistician  Statisticians use the power of math and probability theory to answer questions that affect the lives of millions of people. They tell educators which teaching method works best, tell policy-makers what levels of pesticides are acceptable in fresh fruit, tell doctors which treatment works best, and tell builders which type of paint is the most durable. They are employed in virtually every type of industry imaginable, from engineering, manufacturing, and medicine to animal science, food production, transportation, and education. Everybody needs a statistician! Read more          Mathematician  Mathematicians are part of an ancient tradition of searching for patterns, conjecturing, and figuring out truths based on rigorous deduction. Some mathematicians focus on purely theoretical problems, with no obvious or immediate applications, except to advance our understanding of mathematics, while others focus on applied mathematics, where they try to solve problems in economics, business, science, physics, or engineering.

Actuaries predict the chances that future negative events will occur in a person's life, and then think of ways to reduce those chances, or reduce the impact of those negative events. Actuaries help bring peace of mind to both families and to businesses. Read more          Math Teacher  Math teachers love mathematics and understand it well, but much more than that, they enjoy sharing their enthusiasm for the language of numbers with students. They use a variety of tools and techniques to help students grasp abstract concepts and show them that math describes the world around them. By helping students conquer fears and anxieties about math, teachers can open up many science and technology career possibilities for students. Teachers make a difference that lasts a lifetime! Read more          Variations   In this science project you used a group of 23 or more people, but you could try it using bigger groups. If you use a group of 366 people (the greatest number of days a year can have) the odds that two people have the same birthday are 100% (excluding February 29 leap year birthdays), but what do you think the odds are in a group of 60 or 75 people?

Mom, dad, son all share a birthday     In a photo taken Dec. 24, 2016, by Luke Gardner with his cellphone on a timer, Luke and Hillary Gardner pose with their son Cade Lee in Baldwyn, Miss. The three share the same birthday.   Luke Gardner, AP        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Luke and Hillary Gardner never have a problem remembering each other’s birthday. After all, the husband and wife were born the same day. And so was their son, 27 years later this past December. The odds of that happening are about one in 133,000, statisticians say. And that’s a lot less likely than getting hit by lightning sometime in your lifetime, which some put at roughly one in 12,000. They weren’t aiming at a joint birthday when their son Cade Lee Gardner was conceived, said Luke Gardner, an assistant pastor at a Baptist church in northeast Mississippi and a student at a nearby campus of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. “I really didn’t even put it together until we got pregnant,” he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. “Then we realized, ‘Oh, wow!’” Using a smartphone app, he said, his wife calculated a due date of Dec. 15, three days before their joint birthday. Her obstetrician called it for Dec. 19. So the couple from Baldwyn, Mississippi, got in some exercise to try to hurry the baby up a bit. The night of Dec. 17, Gardner said, “we went walking” around the parking lot at First Baptist Church of Baldwyn, where Gardner is outreach pastor. Whether or not the exercise sped things up, Cade was born at 10:01 a.m. on Dec. 18 -- exactly 27 years after his parents’ birthdate. “Hillary is exactly six hours older than me,” Luke Gardner said. She was born at 8:10 a.m. and her husband at 2:10 p.m. on Dec. 18, 1989. They learned about their shared birthday before they started dating, while just part of a group of friends who hung out together. “I saw it on a Facebook page first and asked about it,” Gardner said. “I couldn’t really believe it when I saw it. I had to confirm it with her.” The chance of meeting someone born the same day as you is one in 365, explained Tumulesh Solanky, chair of the math department at the University of New Orleans. He said the chance of two people being born on the same day and having a baby on their birthday is about 1/365 times 1/365. “That comes out to .0000000751 -- seven zeros and then 751,” or about 7.5 in a million, he said, which comes to about one in 133,000. Statisticians note that this ignores such factors as leap years and the fact that births are not evenly spaced throughout the year. Gardner joked that if he and Hillary Gardner have more children, they may have to try for December. “If we have any more kids, if we don’t get pregnant in March, we’ll have to wait till the next year,” he said.   © 2017 The Associated Press.

Incapsula incident ID: 303001860163233935-473274394965117864         Birthday problem   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   For yearly variation in mortality rates, see birthday effect . For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem.

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk.

An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.  Other birthday problems [ edit ]  Reverse problem [ edit ]  For a fixed probability p :   Find the greatest n for which the probability p ( n ) is smaller than the given p , or  Find the smallest n for which the probability p ( n ) is greater than the given p .   Taking the above formula for d = 365 we have:       n  (  p  ;  365  )  ≈    730  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;365)\approx {\sqrt {730\ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     Sample calculations [ edit ]      p  n  n ↓  p ( n ↓)  n ↑  p ( n ↑)    0.01  0.14178 √ 365 = 2.70864  2  0.00274  3  0.00820    0.05  0.32029 √ 365 = 6.11916  6  0.04046  7  0.05624    0.1  0.45904 √ 365 = 8.77002  8  0.07434  9  0.09462    0.2  0.66805 √ 365 = 12.76302  12  0.16702  13  0.19441    0.3  0.84460 √ 365 = 16.13607  16  0.28360  17  0.31501    0.5  1.17741 √ 365 = 22.49439  22  0.47570  23  0.50730    0.7  1.55176 √ 365 = 29.64625  29  0.68097  30  0.70632    0.8  1.79412 √ 365 = 34.27666  34  0.79532  35  0.81438    0.9  2.14597 √ 365 = 40.99862  40  0.89123  41  0.90315    0.95  2.44775 √ 365 = 46.76414  46  0.94825  47  0.95477    0.99  3.03485 √ 365 = 57.98081  57  0.99012  58  0.99166      Note: some values falling outside the bounds have been colored to show that the approximation is not always exact.  First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron. "An Analysis of the Distribution of Birthdays in a Calendar Year" . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   Mathers, C D; R S Harris (1983). "Seasonal Distribution of Births in Australia" . International Journal of Epidemiology . 12 (3): 326–331. doi : 10.1093/ije/12.3.326 . PMID  6629621 . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk.

An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.  Other birthday problems [ edit ]  Reverse problem [ edit ]  For a fixed probability p :   Find the greatest n for which the probability p ( n ) is smaller than the given p , or  Find the smallest n for which the probability p ( n ) is greater than the given p .   Taking the above formula for d = 365 we have:       n  (  p  ;  365  )  ≈    730  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;365)\approx {\sqrt {730\ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     Sample calculations [ edit ]      p  n  n ↓  p ( n ↓)  n ↑  p ( n ↑)    0.01  0.14178 √ 365 = 2.70864  2  0.00274  3  0.00820    0.05  0.32029 √ 365 = 6.11916  6  0.04046  7  0.05624    0.1  0.45904 √ 365 = 8.77002  8  0.07434  9  0.09462    0.2  0.66805 √ 365 = 12.76302  12  0.16702  13  0.19441    0.3  0.84460 √ 365 = 16.13607  16  0.28360  17  0.31501    0.5  1.17741 √ 365 = 22.49439  22  0.47570  23  0.50730    0.7  1.55176 √ 365 = 29.64625  29  0.68097  30  0.70632    0.8  1.79412 √ 365 = 34.27666  34  0.79532  35  0.81438    0.9  2.14597 √ 365 = 40.99862  40  0.89123  41  0.90315    0.95  2.44775 √ 365 = 46.76414  46  0.94825  47  0.95477    0.99  3.03485 √ 365 = 57.98081  57  0.99012  58  0.99166      Note: some values falling outside the bounds have been colored to show that the approximation is not always exact.  First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron. "An Analysis of the Distribution of Birthdays in a Calendar Year" . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   Mathers, C D; R S Harris (1983). "Seasonal Distribution of Births in Australia" . International Journal of Epidemiology . 12 (3): 326–331. doi : 10.1093/ije/12.3.326 . PMID  6629621 . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk.

An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.  Other birthday problems [ edit ]  Reverse problem [ edit ]  For a fixed probability p :   Find the greatest n for which the probability p ( n ) is smaller than the given p , or  Find the smallest n for which the probability p ( n ) is greater than the given p .   Taking the above formula for d = 365 we have:       n  (  p  ;  365  )  ≈    730  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;365)\approx {\sqrt {730\ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     Sample calculations [ edit ]      p  n  n ↓  p ( n ↓)  n ↑  p ( n ↑)    0.01  0.14178 √ 365 = 2.70864  2  0.00274  3  0.00820    0.05  0.32029 √ 365 = 6.11916  6  0.04046  7  0.05624    0.1  0.45904 √ 365 = 8.77002  8  0.07434  9  0.09462    0.2  0.66805 √ 365 = 12.76302  12  0.16702  13  0.19441    0.3  0.84460 √ 365 = 16.13607  16  0.28360  17  0.31501    0.5  1.17741 √ 365 = 22.49439  22  0.47570  23  0.50730    0.7  1.55176 √ 365 = 29.64625  29  0.68097  30  0.70632    0.8  1.79412 √ 365 = 34.27666  34  0.79532  35  0.81438    0.9  2.14597 √ 365 = 40.99862  40  0.89123  41  0.90315    0.95  2.44775 √ 365 = 46.76414  46  0.94825  47  0.95477    0.99  3.03485 √ 365 = 57.98081  57  0.99012  58  0.99166      Note: some values falling outside the bounds have been colored to show that the approximation is not always exact.  First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron. "An Analysis of the Distribution of Birthdays in a Calendar Year" . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   Mathers, C D; R S Harris (1983). "Seasonal Distribution of Births in Australia" . International Journal of Epidemiology . 12 (3): 326–331. doi : 10.1093/ije/12.3.326 . PMID  6629621 . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

Statistics Blog > Same Birthday Odds  It stands to reason that same birthday odds for one person meeting another are 1/365 (365 days in the year and your birthday is on one of them).  But consider this: If you get a group of 30 people together, two of them will almost definitely have the same birthday. This blew my mind when I was a student.  There were 30 students in my undergrad statistics class and the professor said the odds of two of us having the same birthday were very high. In fact, two people in the class did have the same birthday. This didn’t seem to make sense to me, as there are 365 days in a year.  My Initial (Incorrect) Reasoning  The odds are 1/365 that I will meet another person with the same birthday. But we’re not talking about just me in a class. We’re talking about every student having those odds. It’s like if I had a 1/10 chance of winning the lottery and I meet another person who also has a 1/10 chance of winning the lottery, then combined we have a 2/10 chance of winning the lottery. The odds of a “coincidence” increases with each person:  Me meeting a person with the same birthday: 1/365 Me and one other friend meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/(365/2) = 183 Three of us meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/(365/3) = 1/122 … Twenty nine of us meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/12.  Those are pretty good odds, but not high enough to account for all those coincidences. That left me with a peculiar puzzle. The odds are actually much higher (over 100 percent for a class of 30).  The reason takes into account all of the possible combinations .  Why the Odds are Actually Much Higher!  One person has a 1/365 chance of meeting someone with the same birthday. Two people have a 1/183 chance of meeting someone with the same birthday. But! Those two people might also have the same birthday, right, so you have to add odds of 1/365 for that. The odds become 1/365 + 1/182.5 = 0.008, or .8 percent. Four people (lets call them ABCD) have a 1/91 chance, but there are 6 possible combinations (AB AC AD BD BC CD) so the probability becomes 1/91 + 6/365…and so on. You can see how it isn’t quite as easy as just x/365!  An Easier Way to Calculate Same Birthday Odds!  If there are 30 students in a class, there are 435 ways two students can be paired. The odds of a “match” become 1/12 + 435/365…which is much greater than 100 percent.  Seeing as the odds are 1/365 that any two students will match birthdays and there are 3 possible matches, it’s no surprise that two of those students share the same birthday. (Use the combinations calculator to figure the combinations out. It will also list all the possible name combinations if you really want to!).  Should I Perform This Experiment in Class?  I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t used this in class for the main reason that with 25 students in a class, the odds are a bit over 50/50 that this experiment will work. A second reason is that the above math is over simplified to be somewhat understandable . Even third or fourth year math majors will struggle a bit with the “true” probabilities behind why this works. Figuring out same birthday odds is very complex for many reasons including:   More people are born weekdays than weekends; mostly due to C-sections and induced births happening during the week, when doctors prefer to work.  Seasonal trends mean that more people are born in the summer than the winter.   Figuring out the true probabilities involves Bayesian logic; hop over to this Stanford University page for a more detailed explanation on Bayesian logic and same birthday odds.      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If you prefer an online interactive environment to learn R and statistics, this free R Tutorial by Datacamp is a great way to get started.

What i don´t understand is, how can the odds be “over 100 percent for a class of 30”? I thought it is impossible to get odds over 100 percent. At least this is what my teachers told me but they might be wrong.          Andale Post author September 17, 2015 at 12:22 pm    I’m 1000 percent certain your teacher was wrong ;) Just kidding. Your teacher is actually *technically* right. In statistics, the maximum probability IS 100 percent. But in “real life” we can be more than 100 percent certain about something, right? That’s one of the reasons the math behind this is mind boggling!

Let’s say brother is born on Jan 1st. Sister can come along on that day…or one of 364 others.          Joanne March 2, 2017 at 5:36 pm    A friend of mine and I share the same birthday to the year and then we had our boys on the exact date! What are the odds of that?          Andale Post author March 3, 2017 at 7:32 am    I also had my son on my birthday ;) The question you are really asking is what are the odds of four people sharing the same birthday, or 1*1/365^3. That’s = .00000002 Or, “pretty small.” :)          Brandi June 7, 2017 at 3:21 pm    Just curious about the odds of someone sharing a birthday with thier maternal Grandmother AND paternal Grandfather. Any thoughts on that?          Andale Post author June 8, 2017 at 7:07 am    Wouldn’t it be just the same as three people sharing the same birthday? After all, the births of each person are independent.          Andrew September 28, 2017 at 7:02 am    I met someone at school who shares the same first name as I do as well as the same birthday, October 3rd.  Was just curious what the odds are of that.          Andale Post author September 28, 2017 at 10:48 am    You would have to know the ratio of how many Andrews there are in the U.S., out of all other names. If you can find that out, you can figure out the odds.          Tim October 1, 2017 at 7:59 am    There is one major flaw in your equation. The odds of meeting someone with the same birthday as you is not 1/365 because far more people are born in specific times of the year than other times. So the chances vary greatly depending on your exact birthday.          Tim October 1, 2017 at 8:02 am    Oops my bad, I did not read the last part that addresses that very thing.

For instance, how many people do you think it would take to survey, on average, to find two people who share the same birthday? Due to probability, sometimes an event is more likely to occur than we believe it to. In this case, if you survey a random group of just 23 people there is actually about a 50–50 chance that two of them will have the same birthday. This is known as the birthday paradox. Don't believe it's true? You can test it and see mathematical probability in action!   Background The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, states that in a random group of 23 people, there is about a 50 percent chance that two people have the same birthday. Is this really true? There are multiple reasons why this seems like a paradox. One is that when in a room with 22 other people, if a person compares his or her birthday with the birthdays of the other people it would make for only 22 comparisons—only 22 chances for people to share the same birthday.  But when all 23 birthdays are compared against each other, it makes for much more than 22 comparisons. How much more? Well, the first person has 22 comparisons to make, but the second person was already compared to the first person, so there are only 21 comparisons to make. The third person then has 20 comparisons, the fourth person has 19 and so on. If you add up all possible comparisons ( 22 + 21 + 20 + 19 + … +1 ) the sum is 253 comparisons, or combinations. Consequently, each group of 23 people involves 253 comparisons, or 253 chances for matching birthdays.   Materials •    Groups of 23 or more people (10 to 12 such groups) or a source with random birthdays (see Preparation below for tips) •    Paper and pen or pencil •    Calculator (optional)   Preparation •    Collect birthdays for random groups of 23 or more people. Ideally you should get 10 to 12 groups of 23 or more people so you have enough different groups to compare. (You don't need the year for the birthdays, just the month and day.) • Tip: Here are a few ways that you can find a number of randomly grouped people: Ask school teachers to pass a list around each of their classes to collect the birthdays for students in the class (most schools have around 25 students in a class); use the birthdays of players on major league baseball teams (this information can easily be found on the Internet); or use the birthdays of other random people using online sources.   Procedure •    For each group of 23 or more birthdays that you collected, sort through them to see if there are any birthday matches in each group. • How many of your groups have two or more people with the same birthday? Based on the birthday paradox, how many groups would you expect to find that have two people with the same birthday? Does the birthday paradox hold true? • Extra: In this activity you used a group of 23 or more people, but you could try it using bigger groups. If you use a group of 366 people—the greatest number of days a year can have—the odds that two people have the same birthday are 100 percent (excluding February 29 leap year birthdays), but what do you think the odds are in a group of 60 or 75 people? • Extra: Rolling dice is a great way to investigate probability. You could try rolling three 10-sided dice and five six-sided dice 100 times each and record the results of each roll. Calculate the mathematical probability of getting a sum higher than 18 for each combination of dice when rolling them 100 times. (This Web site can teach you how to calculate probability: Probability Central from Oracle ThinkQuest.) Which combination has a higher mathematical probability, and was this true when you rolled them?  Observations and results Did about 50 percent of the groups of 23 or more people include at least two people with the same birthdays?  When comparing probabilities with birthdays, it can be easier to look at the probability that people do not share a birthday. A person's birthday is one out of 365 possibilities (excluding February 29 birthdays). The probability that a person does not have the same birthday as another person is 364 divided by 365 because there are 364 days that are not a person's birthday. This means that any two people have a 364/365, or 99.726027 percent, chance of not matching birthdays.  As mentioned before, in a group of 23 people, there are 253 comparisons, or combinations, that can be made. So, we're not looking at just one comparison, but at 253 comparisons. Every one of the 253 combinations has the same odds, 99.726027 percent, of not being a match. If you multiply 99.726027 percent by 99.726027 253 times, or calculate (364/365) 253 , you'll find there's a 49.952 percent chance that all 253 comparisons contain no matches. Consequently, the odds that there is a birthday match in those 253 comparisons is 1 – 49.952 percent = 50.048 percent , or just over half! The more trials you run, the closer the actual probability should approach 50 percent.

Shared Birthdays Updated 25 May 2003    Probability of Shared Birthdays or, How to Win Money in Bar Bets  Copyright © 2001–2017 by Stan Brown    Summary: In a group of 30 people, would you be surprised if two of them
have the same birthday? As it turns out, you should be more surprised
if they don’t.  There are 365 possible birthdays. (To keep the numbers simpler,
we’ll ignore leap years.) The key to assigning the probability is to
think in terms of complements : “Two (or
more) people share a birthday” is the complement of “All people in the
group have different birthdays.” Each probability is 1 minus the
other.  (a) What is the probability that any two
people have different birthdays? The first person could have
any birthday (p = 365÷365 = 1), and the second person
could then have any of the other 364 birthdays (p =
364÷365). Multiply those two and you have about 0.9973 as the
probability that any two people have different birthdays, or
1−0.9973 = 0.0027 as the probability that they have the
same birthday.  (b) Now add a third person . What is
the probability that her birthday is different from the other two?
Since there are 363 days still “unused” out of 365, we have p =
363÷365 = about 0.9945. Multiply that by the 0.9973 for two
people and you have about 0.9918, the probability that three randomly
selected people will have different birthdays.  (c) Now add a fourth person, and a fifth, and so on until you have
22 people with different birthdays (p ≈ 52.4%). When you add the 23rd person, you
should have p ≈ 49.3%.  (d) If the probability that 23 randomly selected people have
different birthdays is 49.3%, what is the probability that two or more
of them have the same birthday? 1−0.493 = 0.507 or 50.7%. In a
randomly selected group of 23 people, it is slightly more likely than
not that two or more of them share a birthday.  For n people (n ≤ 365), your chain of n fractions would be   and therefore   On your TI-83, to get 365 P n you first
enter the 365, then press [ MATH ] [ ◄ ] to get the PRB menu
and [ 2 ] for nPr, then enter the second number. In Excel,
it’s PERMUT(365,n).  What if n > 365? In this case there is no
need for any calculations (and in fact the above formula won’t work).
If there are 366 or more people, but only 365 possible birthdays
disregarding leap year, then two or more of them must share a
birthday.  Here are some sample results:   Probability in a group of n people that 2 or more have the same birthday   10 0.117  20 0.411  22 0.476  23 0.507  30 0.706  40 0.891  50 0.970   You can see that the dividing line is between 22 and 23 people. In
a group of 22 people, the odds are less than 50–50 that two share a
birthday; in a group of 23, the odds are better than 50–50. In a bar
with even a small crowd, if you can get someone to take your bet that
two people share a birthday, you’ll win more often than you lose.  In a randomly selected group of  50 people or more, it
is nearly certain that two or more will share a birthday
(p ≥ 97%).

Bruce Cook  hide caption    toggle caption   Bruce Cook    The Weekend Edition Saturday Math Guy, Stanford professor Keith Devlin, has a problem. In fact, he has more than one... which he's happy to share with Scott Simon.   Up for a Challenge?    If you think the two examples at right are tricky, take a look at two of the most notorious probability puzzles of all:       The Two Envelopes Paradox     The Monty Hall Problem      What is the probability that in a room filled with 23 people at least two of them have the same birthday? (It's more than half!)  Devlin explains:  The birthday problem asks how many people you need to have at a party so that there is a better-than-even chance that two of them will share the same birthday. Most people think the answer is 183, the smallest whole number larger than 365/2. In fact, you need just 23. The answer 183 is the correct answer to a very different question: How many people do you need to have at a party so that there is a better-than-even chance that one of them will share YOUR birthday? If there is no restriction on which two people will share a birthday, it makes an enormous difference. With 23 people in a room, there are 253 different ways of pairing two people together, and that gives a lot of possibilities of finding a pair with the same birthday.  Here is the precise calculation. To figure out the exact probability of finding two people with the same birthday in a given group, it turns out to be easier to ask the opposite question: what is the probability that NO two will share a birthday, i.e., that they will all have different birthdays? With just two people, the probability that they have different birthdays is 364/365, or about .997. If a third person joins them, the probability that this new person has a different birthday from those two (i.e., the probability that all three will have different birthdays) is (364/365) x (363/365), about .992. With a fourth person, the probability that all four have different birthdays is (364/365) x (363/365) x (362/365), which comes out at around .983. And so on. The answers to these multiplications get steadily smaller. When a twenty-third person enters the room, the final fraction that you multiply by is 343/365, and the answer you get drops below .5 for the first time, being approximately .493. This is the probability that all 23 people have a different birthday. So, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is 1 - .493 = .507, just greater than 1/2.     The Children Puzzle  I tell you that a couple has two children and that (at least) one of them is a boy. I ask you what is the probability that their other child is a boy. Most people think the answer is 1/2, arguing that it is equally likely that the other child is a boy or a girl. But that's not the right answer for the question I have asked you. Here's why. In terms of order of birth, there are four possibilities for the couple's children: BB, BG, GB, GG. When I tell you that at least one child is a boy, I rule out the possibility GG. That leaves three possibilities: BB, BG, GB. With two of these, the other child is a girl; so the probability of the other child being a girl is 2/3. Leaving the probability of the other child being a boy at 1/3.

Undo Answer Wiki 5 Answers   Roderick O'Mahony , Higher Diploma in Policy Analysis, IPA Dublin 2006 from UCC Cork (1991) Answered Dec 17, 2017 Assuming you mean date and month rather than year, it’s 0.03 %. This is worked out by flipping it the other way. For example what’s the probability of me NOT sharing a birthday with anyone in an empty room? Clear the answer is 1 or 365/365, but if someone comes in and I ask the question again they have 364/365 chances of not sharing a birthday. The calculation is 365/365 * 364/365 = 0.997 of the two of us not sharing a birthday so the balance 0.03% is us sharing a birthday (to make it add to one as they are the only the outcomes. By the way to get a chance of better than 50% having the same birthday you need 23 people just keep multiplying the probabilities eg for person number 3 you multiply by 363/365 and so on.

Ask New Question   James Grimaldi Answered Nov 7, 2014 I think the question you are asking is about the how in a group over a certain size it is highly likely that two people have the same birthday. The 1 365 explanation is correct but is answering a different question than what you are asking. There is 1 in 365 chance that a persons birthday will be a certain date. That may be the chance that a single pair of birthdays match. Any group larger than two provides multiple pairs. The odds go up as the group gets larger. Figuring out how that impacts the odds means figuring out the number of possible pairs (see Birthday problem on Wikipedia or Ask Dr. Math FAQ: The Birthday Problem on Drexel Math Forum). The number of possible pairs goes up much more rapidly than our intuition tells us. To make it more than even money our intuition tells us hundreds, but the reality is a couple of dozen people is enough. 3.9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

from https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/Math_p007/pure-mathematics/birthday-paradox  Last edit date: 2017-07-28   Introduction  The birthday paradox , also known as the birthday problem, states that in a random gathering of 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two people will have the same birthday. Is this really true?  Due to probability , sometimes an event is more likely to occur than we believe it to, especially when our own viewpoint affects how we analyze a situation.  For example, one reason why the birthday paradox seems like a paradox is that when in a room with 22 other people, if a person compares his or her birthday with the birthdays of the other people it would make for only 22 comparisons, or, in other words, only 22 chances for people to share the same birthday. But when all 23 birthdays are compared against each other, it makes for much more than 22 comparisons.  How much more?  While the first person has 22 comparisons to make, the second person was already compared to the first person, so there are only 21 comparisons to make.  The third person then has 20 comparisons, the fourth person has 19 comparisons, and so on.  If you add up all possible comparisons (22 + 21 + 20 + 19 ... + 1) the sum is 253 comparisons, or combinations.  Consequently, each group of 23 people involves 253 comparisons, or 253 chances for matching birthdays. But how do 253 comparisons lead to a 50% chance of two people having the same birthday?  Check out the resources in the Bibliography below to help you find out how!  In this science fair project, you will investigate whether the birthday paradox holds true by looking at several random groups of 23 or more people.  Will 50% of the groups include at least two people with the same birthday, making the birthday paradox hold true?  Terms and Concepts   Birthday paradox  Probability   Questions   What is the probability that a coin flipped will land "heads"?  What is the probability that a coin flipped three times in a row will land "heads" each time?  What are the odds that two people share the same birthday in a group of 366 people?  ( Hint : 366 is the greatest number of days a year can have.)  If 253 unique comparisons can be made between 23 people, how does this lead to a 50% chance of two people in a group of 23 having the same birthday?

Ideally you would like to get 10-12 groups of 23 or more people so you have enough different groups to compare. (You do not need the year for the birthdays, just the month and day.) Here are a couple of ways that you can find a number of randomly grouped people:  Most schools have around 25 students in a class, so ask a teacher from each grade at your school to pass a list around each of his/her classes to collect the birthdays for students in each of his/her classes.  Use the birthdays of players on major league baseball teams. ( Note: This information can easily be found on the internet). Alternatively, use the birthdays of other random people using online sources.   For each group of 23 or more birthdays that you collected, sort through all the them to see if there are any birthday matches in each group. How many of your groups have two or more people with the same birthday? Based on the birthday paradox, how many groups would you expect to find that have two people with the same birthday?

If you like this project, you might enjoy exploring these related careers:       Statistician  Statisticians use the power of math and probability theory to answer questions that affect the lives of millions of people. They tell educators which teaching method works best, tell policy-makers what levels of pesticides are acceptable in fresh fruit, tell doctors which treatment works best, and tell builders which type of paint is the most durable. They are employed in virtually every type of industry imaginable, from engineering, manufacturing, and medicine to animal science, food production, transportation, and education. Everybody needs a statistician!

Some mathematicians focus on purely theoretical problems, with no obvious or immediate applications, except to advance our understanding of mathematics, while others focus on applied mathematics, where they try to solve problems in economics, business, science, physics, or engineering.

They use a variety of tools and techniques to help students grasp abstract concepts and show them that math describes the world around them. By helping students conquer fears and anxieties about math, teachers can open up many science and technology career possibilities for students. Teachers make a difference that lasts a lifetime!

Mom, dad, son all share a birthday     In a photo taken Dec. 24, 2016, by Luke Gardner with his cellphone on a timer, Luke and Hillary Gardner pose with their son Cade Lee in Baldwyn, Miss. The three share the same birthday.   Luke Gardner, AP        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Luke and Hillary Gardner never have a problem remembering each other’s birthday. After all, the husband and wife were born the same day. And so was their son, 27 years later this past December. The odds of that happening are about one in 133,000, statisticians say. And that’s a lot less likely than getting hit by lightning sometime in your lifetime, which some put at roughly one in 12,000. They weren’t aiming at a joint birthday when their son Cade Lee Gardner was conceived, said Luke Gardner, an assistant pastor at a Baptist church in northeast Mississippi and a student at a nearby campus of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. “I really didn’t even put it together until we got pregnant,” he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. “Then we realized, ‘Oh, wow!’” Using a smartphone app, he said, his wife calculated a due date of Dec. 15, three days before their joint birthday. Her obstetrician called it for Dec. 19. So the couple from Baldwyn, Mississippi, got in some exercise to try to hurry the baby up a bit. The night of Dec. 17, Gardner said, “we went walking” around the parking lot at First Baptist Church of Baldwyn, where Gardner is outreach pastor. Whether or not the exercise sped things up, Cade was born at 10:01 a.m. on Dec. 18 -- exactly 27 years after his parents’ birthdate. “Hillary is exactly six hours older than me,” Luke Gardner said. She was born at 8:10 a.m. and her husband at 2:10 p.m. on Dec. 18, 1989. They learned about their shared birthday before they started dating, while just part of a group of friends who hung out together. “I saw it on a Facebook page first and asked about it,” Gardner said. “I couldn’t really believe it when I saw it. I had to confirm it with her.” The chance of meeting someone born the same day as you is one in 365, explained Tumulesh Solanky, chair of the math department at the University of New Orleans. He said the chance of two people being born on the same day and having a baby on their birthday is about 1/365 times 1/365. “That comes out to .0000000751 -- seven zeros and then 751,” or about 7.5 in a million, he said, which comes to about one in 133,000. Statisticians note that this ignores such factors as leap years and the fact that births are not evenly spaced throughout the year. Gardner joked that if he and Hillary Gardner have more children, they may have to try for December. “If we have any more kids, if we don’t get pregnant in March, we’ll have to wait till the next year,” he said.   © 2017 The Associated Press.

However, it is usual in the English-speaking world to call people who share the same birthday as "birthday twins." Less frequently "Irish twins," especially in the sense of same day and month but one year apart . Also found is "birthday buddy" (via Urban Dictionary ). Interestingly, the Birthday problem is a mathematical paradox. 72.4k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .     The computed probability of at least two people sharing a birthday versus the number of people       Contents    1  Calculating the probability  2  Approximations   2.1  A simple exponentiation  2.2  Poisson approximation  2.3  Square approximation  2.4  Approximation of number of people  2.5  Probability table    3  An upper bound  4  Generalizations   4.1  The generalized birthday problem  4.2  Cast as a collision problem   4.2.1  Generalization to multiple types      5  Other birthday problems   5.1  Reverse problem   5.1.1  Sample calculations    5.2  First match  5.3  Same birthday as you  5.4  Near matches  5.5  Collision counting  5.6  Average number of people    6  Partition problem  7  In fiction  8  Notes  9  References  10  Bibliography  11  External links     Calculating the probability [ edit ]  The problem is to compute an approximate probability that in a group of n people at least two have the same birthday. For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.  Other birthday problems [ edit ]  Reverse problem [ edit ]  For a fixed probability p :   Find the greatest n for which the probability p ( n ) is smaller than the given p , or  Find the smallest n for which the probability p ( n ) is greater than the given p .   Taking the above formula for d = 365 we have:       n  (  p  ;  365  )  ≈    730  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;365)\approx {\sqrt {730\ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     Sample calculations [ edit ]      p  n  n ↓  p ( n ↓)  n ↑  p ( n ↑)    0.01  0.14178 √ 365 = 2.70864  2  0.00274  3  0.00820    0.05  0.32029 √ 365 = 6.11916  6  0.04046  7  0.05624    0.1  0.45904 √ 365 = 8.77002  8  0.07434  9  0.09462    0.2  0.66805 √ 365 = 12.76302  12  0.16702  13  0.19441    0.3  0.84460 √ 365 = 16.13607  16  0.28360  17  0.31501    0.5  1.17741 √ 365 = 22.49439  22  0.47570  23  0.50730    0.7  1.55176 √ 365 = 29.64625  29  0.68097  30  0.70632    0.8  1.79412 √ 365 = 34.27666  34  0.79532  35  0.81438    0.9  2.14597 √ 365 = 40.99862  40  0.89123  41  0.90315    0.95  2.44775 √ 365 = 46.76414  46  0.94825  47  0.95477    0.99  3.03485 √ 365 = 57.98081  57  0.99012  58  0.99166      Note: some values falling outside the bounds have been colored to show that the approximation is not always exact.  First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk.

An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.  Other birthday problems [ edit ]  Reverse problem [ edit ]  For a fixed probability p :   Find the greatest n for which the probability p ( n ) is smaller than the given p , or  Find the smallest n for which the probability p ( n ) is greater than the given p .   Taking the above formula for d = 365 we have:       n  (  p  ;  365  )  ≈    730  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;365)\approx {\sqrt {730\ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     Sample calculations [ edit ]      p  n  n ↓  p ( n ↓)  n ↑  p ( n ↑)    0.01  0.14178 √ 365 = 2.70864  2  0.00274  3  0.00820    0.05  0.32029 √ 365 = 6.11916  6  0.04046  7  0.05624    0.1  0.45904 √ 365 = 8.77002  8  0.07434  9  0.09462    0.2  0.66805 √ 365 = 12.76302  12  0.16702  13  0.19441    0.3  0.84460 √ 365 = 16.13607  16  0.28360  17  0.31501    0.5  1.17741 √ 365 = 22.49439  22  0.47570  23  0.50730    0.7  1.55176 √ 365 = 29.64625  29  0.68097  30  0.70632    0.8  1.79412 √ 365 = 34.27666  34  0.79532  35  0.81438    0.9  2.14597 √ 365 = 40.99862  40  0.89123  41  0.90315    0.95  2.44775 √ 365 = 46.76414  46  0.94825  47  0.95477    0.99  3.03485 √ 365 = 57.98081  57  0.99012  58  0.99166      Note: some values falling outside the bounds have been colored to show that the approximation is not always exact.  First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron. "An Analysis of the Distribution of Birthdays in a Calendar Year" . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   Mathers, C D; R S Harris (1983). "Seasonal Distribution of Births in Australia" . International Journal of Epidemiology . 12 (3): 326–331. doi : 10.1093/ije/12.3.326 . PMID  6629621 . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk.

An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.  Other birthday problems [ edit ]  Reverse problem [ edit ]  For a fixed probability p :   Find the greatest n for which the probability p ( n ) is smaller than the given p , or  Find the smallest n for which the probability p ( n ) is greater than the given p .   Taking the above formula for d = 365 we have:       n  (  p  ;  365  )  ≈    730  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;365)\approx {\sqrt {730\ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     Sample calculations [ edit ]      p  n  n ↓  p ( n ↓)  n ↑  p ( n ↑)    0.01  0.14178 √ 365 = 2.70864  2  0.00274  3  0.00820    0.05  0.32029 √ 365 = 6.11916  6  0.04046  7  0.05624    0.1  0.45904 √ 365 = 8.77002  8  0.07434  9  0.09462    0.2  0.66805 √ 365 = 12.76302  12  0.16702  13  0.19441    0.3  0.84460 √ 365 = 16.13607  16  0.28360  17  0.31501    0.5  1.17741 √ 365 = 22.49439  22  0.47570  23  0.50730    0.7  1.55176 √ 365 = 29.64625  29  0.68097  30  0.70632    0.8  1.79412 √ 365 = 34.27666  34  0.79532  35  0.81438    0.9  2.14597 √ 365 = 40.99862  40  0.89123  41  0.90315    0.95  2.44775 √ 365 = 46.76414  46  0.94825  47  0.95477    0.99  3.03485 √ 365 = 57.98081  57  0.99012  58  0.99166      Note: some values falling outside the bounds have been colored to show that the approximation is not always exact.  First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron. "An Analysis of the Distribution of Birthdays in a Calendar Year" . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   Mathers, C D; R S Harris (1983). "Seasonal Distribution of Births in Australia" . International Journal of Epidemiology . 12 (3): 326–331. doi : 10.1093/ije/12.3.326 . PMID  6629621 . Retrieved 2011-12-27 .   These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

For the mathematical brain teaser that was asked in the Math Olympiad, see Cheryl's Birthday .  In probability theory , the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n  randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday . By the pigeonhole principle , the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29 ). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.  Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack , which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function .  The history of the problem is obscure. W. W. Rouse Ball indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by Harold Davenport . [1] However, Richard von Mises proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem. [2] The problem was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1957 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American .

For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years , twins , seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis. [nb 1] )  The goal is to compute P ( A ) , the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P ( A ′) , the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A ′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive , P ( A ) = 1 − P ( A ′).  In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P ( A ) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P ( A ) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability : the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2. This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365. Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P ( A ′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    365  365    ×    364  365    ×    363  365    ×    362  365    ×  ⋯  ×    343  365      {\displaystyle P(A')={\frac {365}{365}}\times {\frac {364}{365}}\times {\frac {363}{365}}\times {\frac {362}{365}}\times \cdots \times {\frac {343}{365}}}                                ( 1 )       The terms of equation ( 1 ) can be collected to arrive at:           P  (   A  ′   )  =    (    1  365    )    23    ×  (  365  ×  364  ×  363  ×  ⋯  ×  343  )    {\displaystyle P(A')=\left({\frac {1}{365}}\right)^{23}\times (365\times 364\times 363\times \cdots \times 343)}                                ( 2 )       Evaluating equation ( 2 ) gives P ( A ′) ≈ 0.492703  Therefore, P ( A ) ≈ 1 − 0.492703 = 0.507297 (50.7297%).  This process can be generalized to a group of n people, where p ( n ) is the probability of at least two of the n people sharing a birthday. It is easier to first calculate the probability p ( n ) that all n birthdays are different . According to the pigeonhole principle , p ( n ) is zero when n > 365 . When n ≤ 365 :              p  ¯     (  n  )     =  1  ×   (   1  −    1  365     )   ×   (   1  −    2  365     )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   1  −     n  −  1   365     )         =     365  ×  364  ×  ⋯  ×  (  365  −  n  +  1  )    365   n            =     365  !     365   n    (  365  −  n  )  !     =     n  !  ⋅     (    365  n    )       365   n      =        365     P   n      365   n            {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&=1\times \left(1-{\frac {1}{365}}\right)\times \left(1-{\frac {2}{365}}\right)\times \cdots \times \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{365}}\right)\\&={\frac {365\times 364\times \cdots \times (365-n+1)}{365^{n}}}\\&={\frac {365!}{365^{n}(365-n)!}}={\frac {n!\cdot {\binom {365}{n}}}{365^{n}}}={\frac {_{365}P_{n}}{365^{n}}}\end{aligned}}}     where ! is the factorial operator, ( 365  n ) is the binomial coefficient and k P r denotes permutation .  The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ( 364 / 365 ), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ( 363 / 365 ), and in general the n th birthday cannot be the same as any of the n − 1 preceding birthdays.  The event of at least two of the n persons having the same birthday is complementary to all n birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability p ( n ) is       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n).}     The following table shows the probability for some other values of n (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):     The probability that no two people share a birthday in a group of n people.

Thus,        e   −    a  365      ≈  1  −    a  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {a}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {a}{365}}.}     Then, replace a with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of p ( n ) until a = n − 1 , for example, when a = 1 ,        e   −    1  365      ≈  1  −    1  365    .    {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\approx 1-{\frac {1}{365}}.}     The first expression derived for p ( n ) can be approximated as              p  ¯     (  n  )     ≈  1  ⋅   e   −    1  365      ⋅   e   −    2  365      ⋅   e   −     n  −  1   365            =   e   −     1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  (  n  −  1  )   365            =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   /   2   365      =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {p}}(n)&\approx 1\cdot e^{-{\frac {1}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {2}{365}}}\cdot e^{-{\frac {n-1}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {1+2+\cdots +(n-1)}{365}}}\\&=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)/2}{365}}}=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.\end{aligned}}}     Therefore,       p  (  n  )  =  1  −     p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle p(n)=1-{\bar {p}}(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     An even coarser approximation is given by       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −   e   −     n   2    730      ,    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n^{2}}{730}}},}     which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.  According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are d , if there are n persons, and if n ≪ d , then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if p ( n , d ) is the probability that at least two out of n people share the same birthday from a set of d available days, then:           p  (  n  ,  d  )     ≈  1  −   e     −  n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d            ≈  1  −   e     −   n   2      2  d      .        {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,d)&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n(n-1)}{2d}}\\&\approx 1-e^{\frac {-n^{2}}{2d}}.\end{aligned}}}     A simple exponentiation [ edit ]  The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is 364 / 365 . In a room containing n people, there are ( n  2 ) = n ( n − 1) / 2 pairs of people, i.e. ( n  2 ) events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short 364 / 365 can be multiplied by itself ( n  2 ) times, which gives us          p  ¯     (  n  )  ≈    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)\approx \left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is       p  (  n  )  ≈  1  −    (    364  365    )      (    n  2    )      .    {\displaystyle p(n)\approx 1-\left({\frac {364}{365}}\right)^{\binom {n}{2}}.}     Poisson approximation [ edit ]  Applying the Poisson approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,       Poi  ⁡   (      (    23  2    )    365    )   =  Poi  ⁡   (    253  365    )   ≈  Poi  ⁡  (  0.6932  )    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {\binom {23}{2}}{365}}\right)=\operatorname {Poi} \left({\frac {253}{365}}\right)\approx \operatorname {Poi} (0.6932)}     so       Pr  (  X  >  0  )  =  1  −  Pr  (  X  =  0  )  ≈  1  −   e   −  0.6932    ≈  1  −  0.499998  =  0.500002.    {\displaystyle \Pr(X>0)=1-\Pr(X=0)\approx 1-e^{-0.6932}\approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.}     The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.  Square approximation [ edit ]  A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation       p  (  n  )  ≈     n   2     2  m       {\displaystyle p(n)\approx {\frac {n^{2}}{2m}}}     which can also be written as       n  ≈    2  m  ×  p  (  n  )      {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2m\times p(n)}}}     which works well for probabilities less than or equal to 1 / 2 . In these equations, m is the number of days in a year.  For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a 1 / 2 chance of a shared birthday, we get       n  ≈    2  ×  365  ×     1  2       =    365    ≈  19    {\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {2\times 365\times {\tfrac {1}{2}}}}={\sqrt {365}}\approx 19}     Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.  Approximation of number of people [ edit ]  This can also be approximated using the following formula for the number of people necessary to have at least a 1 / 2 chance of matching:       n  ≈     1  2     +       1  4     +  2  ×  ln  ⁡  (  2  )  ×  365    =  22.999943.    {\displaystyle n\approx {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\sqrt {{\tfrac {1}{4}}+2\times \ln(2)\times 365}}=22.999943.}     This is a result of the good approximation that an event with 1 / k probability will have a 1 / 2 chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated k  ln 2 times.

Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).  For comparison, 6982100000000000000♠ 10 −18 to 6985100000000000000♠ 10 −15 is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. [4] In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5 , should stay within that range until about 7011819999999999999♠ 8.2 × 10 11 documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.  An upper bound [ edit ]  The argument below is adapted from an argument of Paul Halmos . [nb 2]  As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is       1  −  p  (  n  )  =     p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   .    {\displaystyle 1-p(n)={\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right).}     As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest n such that p ( n ) > 1 / 2 ; or equivalently, the smallest n such that p ( n ) < 1 / 2 .  Using the inequality 1 − x < e − x in the above expression we replace 1 − k / 365 with e −​ k ⁄ 365 . This yields          p  ¯     (  n  )  =   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  365     )   <   ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   e   −    k  365      )   =   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      .    {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{365}}\right)<\prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-{\frac {k}{365}}}\right)=e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}.}     Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an upper bound of p ( n ) . The inequality        e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )   730      <    1  2      {\displaystyle e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{730}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}}     implies p ( n ) < 1 / 2 . Solving for n gives        n   2    −  n  >  730  ln  ⁡  2.    {\displaystyle n^{2}-n>730\ln 2.}     Now, 730 ln 2 is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of n 2 − n attained when n = 23 . Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving n 2 − n = 730 ln 2 for n gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.  This derivation only shows that at most 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that n is 22 or less could also work.  Generalizations [ edit ]  The generalized birthday problem [ edit ]  Given a year with d days, the generalized birthday problem asks for the minimal number n ( d ) such that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, n ( d ) is the minimal integer n such that       1  −   (   1  −    1  d     )    (   1  −    2  d     )   ⋯   (   1  −     n  −  1   d     )   ≥    1  2    .    {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{d}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {2}{d}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {n-1}{d}}\right)\geq {\frac {1}{2}}.}     The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining n (365) . The first 99 values of n ( d ) are given here:      d  1–2  3–5  6–9  10–16  17–23  24–32  33–42  43–54  55–68  69–82  83–99    n ( d )  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12      A number of bounds and formulas for n ( d ) have been published. [5] For any d ≥ 1 , the number n ( d ) satisfies [6]          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    <  n  (  d  )  −    2  d  ln  ⁡  2    ≤  9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    .    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}<n(d)-{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\leq 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}.}     These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence n ( d ) − √ 2 d ln 2 gets arbitrarily close to          3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    ≈  0.27  ,    {\displaystyle {\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\approx 0.27,}     while it has       9  −    86  ln  ⁡  2    ≈  1.28    {\displaystyle 9-{\sqrt {86\ln 2}}\approx 1.28}     as its maximum, taken for d = 43 .  The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of n ( d ) in 99% of all cases, for example n (365) = 23 . In general, it follows from these bounds that n ( d ) always equals either        ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     or     ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉   +  1    {\displaystyle \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil \quad {\text{or}}\quad \left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil +1}     where ⌈ · ⌉ denotes the ceiling function . The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}\,\right\rceil }     holds for 73% of all integers d . [7] The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6     ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}\right\rceil }     holds for almost all  d , i.e., for a set of integers d with asymptotic density 1. [7]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2        ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula. [8]  The formula       n  (  d  )  =   ⌈     2  d  ln  ⁡  2    +     3  −  2  ln  ⁡  2   6    +     9  −  4  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      72    2  d  ln  ⁡  2       −     2  (  ln  ⁡  2   )   2      135  d      ⌉     {\displaystyle n(d)=\left\lceil {\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}+{\frac {3-2\ln 2}{6}}+{\frac {9-4(\ln 2)^{2}}{72{\sqrt {2d\ln 2}}}}-{\frac {2(\ln 2)^{2}}{135d}}\right\rceil }     holds for all d ≤ 7018100000000000000♠ 10 18 , and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all d . [8]  Cast as a collision problem [ edit ]  The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:   Given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution with range [1, d ] , what is the probability p ( n ; d ) that at least two numbers are the same? ( d = 365 gives the usual birthday problem.) [9]   The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.           p  (  n  ;  d  )     =    {     1  −    ∏   k  =  1    n  −  1     (   1  −    k  d     )      n  ≤  d      1    n  >  d              ≈  1  −   e   −     n  (  n  −  1  )    2  d             ≈  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )      n  (  n  −  1  )   2           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n;d)&={\begin{cases}1-\displaystyle \prod _{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-{\frac {k}{d}}\right)&n\leq d\\1&n>d\end{cases}}\\[8px]&\approx 1-e^{-{\frac {n(n-1)}{2d}}}\\&\approx 1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}\end{aligned}}}     Conversely, if n ( p ; d ) denotes the number of random integers drawn from [1, d ] to obtain a probability p that at least two numbers are the same, then       n  (  p  ;  d  )  ≈    2  d  ⋅  ln  ⁡   (    1   1  −  p     )     .    {\displaystyle n(p;d)\approx {\sqrt {2d\cdot \ln \left({\frac {1}{1-p}}\right)}}.}     The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to hash functions : the expected number of N - bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2 N , but rather only 2 ​ N ⁄ 2 . This is exploited by birthday attacks on cryptographic hash functions and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a hash table are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.  The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel [10] under the name of capture-recapture statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.  Generalization to multiple types [ edit ]     Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman    The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types. [11] In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say m men and n women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is        p   0    =    1   d   m  +  n       ∑   i  =  1    m     ∑   j  =  1    n     S   2    (  m  ,  i  )   S   2    (  n  ,  j  )   ∏   k  =  0    i  +  j  −  1    d  −  k    {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac {1}{d^{m+n}}}\sum _{i=1}^{m}\sum _{j=1}^{n}S_{2}(m,i)S_{2}(n,j)\prod _{k=0}^{i+j-1}d-k}     where d = 365 and S 2 are Stirling numbers of the second kind . Consequently, the desired probability is 1 − p 0 .  This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people m + n . For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

First match [ edit ]  A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room? That is, for what n is p ( n ) − p ( n − 1) maximum? The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.  Same birthday as you [ edit ]     Comparing p ( n ) = probability of a birthday match with q ( n ) = probability of matching your birthday    Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability q ( n ) that someone in a room of n other people has the same birthday as a particular person (for example, you), is given by       q  (  n  )  =  1  −    (     365  −  1   365    )    n      {\displaystyle q(n)=1-\left({\frac {365-1}{365}}\right)^{n}}     and for general d by       q  (  n  ;  d  )  =  1  −    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle q(n;d)=1-\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     In the standard case of d = 365 substituting n = 23 gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16. For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of n people has the same birthday as you , n would need to be at least 253. Note that this number is significantly higher than 365 / 2 = 182  1 / 2 : the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.  It is not a coincidence that 253 = 23 × (23 − 1) / 2 ; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.  Near matches [ edit ]  Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of n people with birthdays within k calendar days of each other's, if there are m equally likely birthdays. [12]           p  (  n  ,  k  ,  m  )     =  1  −     (  m  −  n  k  −  1  )  !     m   n  −  1      (    m  −  n  (  k  +  1  )    )    !           {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(n,k,m)&=1-{\frac {(m-nk-1)!}{m^{n-1}{\bigl (}m-n(k+1){\bigr )}!}}\end{aligned}}}     The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by k days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:      k  n for m = 365    0  23    1  14    2  11    3  9    4  8    5  8    6  7    7  7      Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other. [12]  Collision counting [ edit ]  The probability that the k th integer randomly chosen from [1, d ] will repeat at least one previous choice equals q ( k − 1; d ) above. The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as n such integers are chosen equals [13]        ∑   k  =  1    n    q  (  k  −  1  ;  d  )  =  n  −  d  +  d    (     d  −  1   d    )    n    .    {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}q(k-1;d)=n-d+d\left({\frac {d-1}{d}}\right)^{n}.}     Average number of people [ edit ]  In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[ n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the Mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the Median . The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming . It may be shown [14] [15] that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M , the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value  n = 1 + Q ( M ) , where       Q  (  M  )  =   ∑   k  =  1    M       M  !    (  M  −  k  )  !   M   k       .    {\displaystyle Q(M)=\sum _{k=1}^{M}{\frac {M!}{(M-k)!M^{k}}}.}     The function       Q  (  M  )  =  1  +     M  −  1   M    +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )    M   2      +  ⋯  +     (  M  −  1  )  (  M  −  2  )  ⋯  1    M   M  −  1        {\displaystyle Q(M)=1+{\frac {M-1}{M}}+{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)}{M^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {(M-1)(M-2)\cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}}}     has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion :       Q  (  M  )  ∼      π  M   2     −    1  3    +    1  12       π   2  M      −    4   135  M     +  ⋯  .    {\displaystyle Q(M)\sim {\sqrt {\frac {\pi M}{2}}}-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{12}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2M}}}-{\frac {4}{135M}}+\cdots .}     With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q ( M ) ≈ 24.61659 , somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.  An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the list of Prime Ministers of Australia , of which there have been 29 as of 2017 [update] , in which Paul Keating , the 24th Prime Minister, and Edmund Barton , the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.  In the 2014 FIFA World Cup , each of the 32 squads had 23 players. An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair. [16]  Voracek, Tran and Formann showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given. [17] Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.  Partition problem [ edit ]  A related problem is the partition problem , a variant of the knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale ; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one tonne ). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?  Some people's intuition is that the answer is above 7005100000000000000♠ 100 000 . Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23. [ citation needed ]  The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are 2 N − 1 different partitions for N weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately Gaussian , with a peak at 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 N and width 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N , so that when 2 N − 1 is approximately equal to 7006100000000000000♠ 1 000 000 √ N the transition occurs. 2 23 − 1 is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million. [18]  In fiction [ edit ]  Arthur C. Clarke 's novel A Fall of Moondust , published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.  Notes [ edit ]     ^  In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [1] , and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day . [ citation needed ] Also, because hospitals rarely schedule caesarian sections and induced labor on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends; [ citation needed ] where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% Swedish statistics board . See also:   Murphy, Ron.

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by Murray Klamkin in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom ( Bloom 1973 ).  ^  In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation. He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:   The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to. The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What calculators do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.       References [ edit ]    ^  W. W.

Statistics Blog > Same Birthday Odds  It stands to reason that same birthday odds for one person meeting another are 1/365 (365 days in the year and your birthday is on one of them).  But consider this: If you get a group of 30 people together, two of them will almost definitely have the same birthday. This blew my mind when I was a student.  There were 30 students in my undergrad statistics class and the professor said the odds of two of us having the same birthday were very high. In fact, two people in the class did have the same birthday. This didn’t seem to make sense to me, as there are 365 days in a year.  My Initial (Incorrect) Reasoning  The odds are 1/365 that I will meet another person with the same birthday. But we’re not talking about just me in a class. We’re talking about every student having those odds. It’s like if I had a 1/10 chance of winning the lottery and I meet another person who also has a 1/10 chance of winning the lottery, then combined we have a 2/10 chance of winning the lottery. The odds of a “coincidence” increases with each person:  Me meeting a person with the same birthday: 1/365 Me and one other friend meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/(365/2) = 183 Three of us meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/(365/3) = 1/122 … Twenty nine of us meeting someone with the same birthday: 1/12.  Those are pretty good odds, but not high enough to account for all those coincidences. That left me with a peculiar puzzle. The odds are actually much higher (over 100 percent for a class of 30).  The reason takes into account all of the possible combinations .  Why the Odds are Actually Much Higher!  One person has a 1/365 chance of meeting someone with the same birthday. Two people have a 1/183 chance of meeting someone with the same birthday. But! Those two people might also have the same birthday, right, so you have to add odds of 1/365 for that. The odds become 1/365 + 1/182.5 = 0.008, or .8 percent. Four people (lets call them ABCD) have a 1/91 chance, but there are 6 possible combinations (AB AC AD BD BC CD) so the probability becomes 1/91 + 6/365…and so on. You can see how it isn’t quite as easy as just x/365!  An Easier Way to Calculate Same Birthday Odds!  If there are 30 students in a class, there are 435 ways two students can be paired. The odds of a “match” become 1/12 + 435/365…which is much greater than 100 percent.  Seeing as the odds are 1/365 that any two students will match birthdays and there are 3 possible matches, it’s no surprise that two of those students share the same birthday. (Use the combinations calculator to figure the combinations out. It will also list all the possible name combinations if you really want to!).  Should I Perform This Experiment in Class?  I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t used this in class for the main reason that with 25 students in a class, the odds are a bit over 50/50 that this experiment will work. A second reason is that the above math is over simplified to be somewhat understandable . Even third or fourth year math majors will struggle a bit with the “true” probabilities behind why this works. Figuring out same birthday odds is very complex for many reasons including:   More people are born weekdays than weekends; mostly due to C-sections and induced births happening during the week, when doctors prefer to work.  Seasonal trends mean that more people are born in the summer than the winter.   Figuring out the true probabilities involves Bayesian logic; hop over to this Stanford University page for a more detailed explanation on Bayesian logic and same birthday odds.      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If you prefer an online interactive environment to learn R and statistics, this free R Tutorial by Datacamp is a great way to get started.

What i don´t understand is, how can the odds be “over 100 percent for a class of 30”? I thought it is impossible to get odds over 100 percent. At least this is what my teachers told me but they might be wrong.          Andale Post author September 17, 2015 at 12:22 pm    I’m 1000 percent certain your teacher was wrong ;) Just kidding. Your teacher is actually *technically* right. In statistics, the maximum probability IS 100 percent. But in “real life” we can be more than 100 percent certain about something, right? That’s one of the reasons the math behind this is mind boggling!

Andale Post author March 3, 2017 at 7:32 am    I also had my son on my birthday ;) The question you are really asking is what are the odds of four people sharing the same birthday, or 1*1/365^3. That’s = .00000002 Or, “pretty small.” :)          Brandi June 7, 2017 at 3:21 pm    Just curious about the odds of someone sharing a birthday with thier maternal Grandmother AND paternal Grandfather. Any thoughts on that?          Andale Post author June 8, 2017 at 7:07 am    Wouldn’t it be just the same as three people sharing the same birthday? After all, the births of each person are independent.          Andrew September 28, 2017 at 7:02 am    I met someone at school who shares the same first name as I do as well as the same birthday, October 3rd.  Was just curious what the odds are of that.          Andale Post author September 28, 2017 at 10:48 am    You would have to know the ratio of how many Andrews there are in the U.S., out of all other names. If you can find that out, you can figure out the odds.          Tim October 1, 2017 at 7:59 am    There is one major flaw in your equation. The odds of meeting someone with the same birthday as you is not 1/365 because far more people are born in specific times of the year than other times. So the chances vary greatly depending on your exact birthday.          Tim October 1, 2017 at 8:02 am    Oops my bad, I did not read the last part that addresses that very thing.

For instance, how many people do you think it would take to survey, on average, to find two people who share the same birthday? Due to probability, sometimes an event is more likely to occur than we believe it to. In this case, if you survey a random group of just 23 people there is actually about a 50–50 chance that two of them will have the same birthday. This is known as the birthday paradox. Don't believe it's true? You can test it and see mathematical probability in action!   Background The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, states that in a random group of 23 people, there is about a 50 percent chance that two people have the same birthday. Is this really true? There are multiple reasons why this seems like a paradox. One is that when in a room with 22 other people, if a person compares his or her birthday with the birthdays of the other people it would make for only 22 comparisons—only 22 chances for people to share the same birthday.  But when all 23 birthdays are compared against each other, it makes for much more than 22 comparisons. How much more? Well, the first person has 22 comparisons to make, but the second person was already compared to the first person, so there are only 21 comparisons to make. The third person then has 20 comparisons, the fourth person has 19 and so on. If you add up all possible comparisons ( 22 + 21 + 20 + 19 + … +1 ) the sum is 253 comparisons, or combinations. Consequently, each group of 23 people involves 253 comparisons, or 253 chances for matching birthdays.   Materials •    Groups of 23 or more people (10 to 12 such groups) or a source with random birthdays (see Preparation below for tips) •    Paper and pen or pencil •    Calculator (optional)   Preparation •    Collect birthdays for random groups of 23 or more people. Ideally you should get 10 to 12 groups of 23 or more people so you have enough different groups to compare. (You don't need the year for the birthdays, just the month and day.) • Tip: Here are a few ways that you can find a number of randomly grouped people: Ask school teachers to pass a list around each of their classes to collect the birthdays for students in the class (most schools have around 25 students in a class); use the birthdays of players on major league baseball teams (this information can easily be found on the Internet); or use the birthdays of other random people using online sources.   Procedure •    For each group of 23 or more birthdays that you collected, sort through them to see if there are any birthday matches in each group. • How many of your groups have two or more people with the same birthday? Based on the birthday paradox, how many groups would you expect to find that have two people with the same birthday? Does the birthday paradox hold true? • Extra: In this activity you used a group of 23 or more people, but you could try it using bigger groups. If you use a group of 366 people—the greatest number of days a year can have—the odds that two people have the same birthday are 100 percent (excluding February 29 leap year birthdays), but what do you think the odds are in a group of 60 or 75 people? • Extra: Rolling dice is a great way to investigate probability. You could try rolling three 10-sided dice and five six-sided dice 100 times each and record the results of each roll. Calculate the mathematical probability of getting a sum higher than 18 for each combination of dice when rolling them 100 times. (This Web site can teach you how to calculate probability: Probability Central from Oracle ThinkQuest.) Which combination has a higher mathematical probability, and was this true when you rolled them?  Observations and results Did about 50 percent of the groups of 23 or more people include at least two people with the same birthdays?  When comparing probabilities with birthdays, it can be easier to look at the probability that people do not share a birthday. A person's birthday is one out of 365 possibilities (excluding February 29 birthdays). The probability that a person does not have the same birthday as another person is 364 divided by 365 because there are 364 days that are not a person's birthday. This means that any two people have a 364/365, or 99.726027 percent, chance of not matching birthdays.  As mentioned before, in a group of 23 people, there are 253 comparisons, or combinations, that can be made. So, we're not looking at just one comparison, but at 253 comparisons. Every one of the 253 combinations has the same odds, 99.726027 percent, of not being a match. If you multiply 99.726027 percent by 99.726027 253 times, or calculate (364/365) 253 , you'll find there's a 49.952 percent chance that all 253 comparisons contain no matches. Consequently, the odds that there is a birthday match in those 253 comparisons is 1 – 49.952 percent = 50.048 percent , or just over half! The more trials you run, the closer the actual probability should approach 50 percent.

Shared Birthdays Updated 25 May 2003    Probability of Shared Birthdays or, How to Win Money in Bar Bets  Copyright © 2001–2017 by Stan Brown    Summary: In a group of 30 people, would you be surprised if two of them
have the same birthday? As it turns out, you should be more surprised
if they don’t.  There are 365 possible birthdays. (To keep the numbers simpler,
we’ll ignore leap years.) The key to assigning the probability is to
think in terms of complements : “Two (or
more) people share a birthday” is the complement of “All people in the
group have different birthdays.” Each probability is 1 minus the
other.  (a) What is the probability that any two
people have different birthdays? The first person could have
any birthday (p = 365÷365 = 1), and the second person
could then have any of the other 364 birthdays (p =
364÷365). Multiply those two and you have about 0.9973 as the
probability that any two people have different birthdays, or
1−0.9973 = 0.0027 as the probability that they have the
same birthday.  (b) Now add a third person . What is
the probability that her birthday is different from the other two?
Since there are 363 days still “unused” out of 365, we have p =
363÷365 = about 0.9945. Multiply that by the 0.9973 for two
people and you have about 0.9918, the probability that three randomly
selected people will have different birthdays.  (c) Now add a fourth person, and a fifth, and so on until you have
22 people with different birthdays (p ≈ 52.4%). When you add the 23rd person, you
should have p ≈ 49.3%.  (d) If the probability that 23 randomly selected people have
different birthdays is 49.3%, what is the probability that two or more
of them have the same birthday? 1−0.493 = 0.507 or 50.7%. In a
randomly selected group of 23 people, it is slightly more likely than
not that two or more of them share a birthday.  For n people (n ≤ 365), your chain of n fractions would be   and therefore   On your TI-83, to get 365 P n you first
enter the 365, then press [ MATH ] [ ◄ ] to get the PRB menu
and [ 2 ] for nPr, then enter the second number. In Excel,
it’s PERMUT(365,n).  What if n > 365? In this case there is no
need for any calculations (and in fact the above formula won’t work).
If there are 366 or more people, but only 365 possible birthdays
disregarding leap year, then two or more of them must share a
birthday.  Here are some sample results:   Probability in a group of n people that 2 or more have the same birthday   10 0.117  20 0.411  22 0.476  23 0.507  30 0.706  40 0.891  50 0.970   You can see that the dividing line is between 22 and 23 people. In
a group of 22 people, the odds are less than 50–50 that two share a
birthday; in a group of 23, the odds are better than 50–50. In a bar
with even a small crowd, if you can get someone to take your bet that
two people share a birthday, you’ll win more often than you lose.  In a randomly selected group of  50 people or more, it
is nearly certain that two or more will share a birthday
(p ≥ 97%).

In fact, he has more than one... which he's happy to share with Scott Simon.   Up for a Challenge?    If you think the two examples at right are tricky, take a look at two of the most notorious probability puzzles of all:       The Two Envelopes Paradox     The Monty Hall Problem      What is the probability that in a room filled with 23 people at least two of them have the same birthday? (It's more than half!)  Devlin explains:  The birthday problem asks how many people you need to have at a party so that there is a better-than-even chance that two of them will share the same birthday. Most people think the answer is 183, the smallest whole number larger than 365/2. In fact, you need just 23. The answer 183 is the correct answer to a very different question: How many people do you need to have at a party so that there is a better-than-even chance that one of them will share YOUR birthday? If there is no restriction on which two people will share a birthday, it makes an enormous difference. With 23 people in a room, there are 253 different ways of pairing two people together, and that gives a lot of possibilities of finding a pair with the same birthday.  Here is the precise calculation. To figure out the exact probability of finding two people with the same birthday in a given group, it turns out to be easier to ask the opposite question: what is the probability that NO two will share a birthday, i.e., that they will all have different birthdays? With just two people, the probability that they have different birthdays is 364/365, or about .997. If a third person joins them, the probability that this new person has a different birthday from those two (i.e., the probability that all three will have different birthdays) is (364/365) x (363/365), about .992. With a fourth person, the probability that all four have different birthdays is (364/365) x (363/365) x (362/365), which comes out at around .983. And so on. The answers to these multiplications get steadily smaller. When a twenty-third person enters the room, the final fraction that you multiply by is 343/365, and the answer you get drops below .5 for the first time, being approximately .493. This is the probability that all 23 people have a different birthday. So, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is 1 - .493 = .507, just greater than 1/2.     The Children Puzzle  I tell you that a couple has two children and that (at least) one of them is a boy. I ask you what is the probability that their other child is a boy. Most people think the answer is 1/2, arguing that it is equally likely that the other child is a boy or a girl. But that's not the right answer for the question I have asked you. Here's why. In terms of order of birth, there are four possibilities for the couple's children: BB, BG, GB, GG. When I tell you that at least one child is a boy, I rule out the possibility GG. That leaves three possibilities: BB, BG, GB. With two of these, the other child is a girl; so the probability of the other child being a girl is 2/3. Leaving the probability of the other child being a boy at 1/3.

Undo Answer Wiki 5 Answers   Roderick O'Mahony , Higher Diploma in Policy Analysis, IPA Dublin 2006 from UCC Cork (1991) Answered Dec 17, 2017 Assuming you mean date and month rather than year, it’s 0.03 %. This is worked out by flipping it the other way. For example what’s the probability of me NOT sharing a birthday with anyone in an empty room? Clear the answer is 1 or 365/365, but if someone comes in and I ask the question again they have 364/365 chances of not sharing a birthday. The calculation is 365/365 * 364/365 = 0.997 of the two of us not sharing a birthday so the balance 0.03% is us sharing a birthday (to make it add to one as they are the only the outcomes. By the way to get a chance of better than 50% having the same birthday you need 23 people just keep multiplying the probabilities eg for person number 3 you multiply by 363/365 and so on.

Ask New Question   James Grimaldi Answered Nov 7, 2014 I think the question you are asking is about the how in a group over a certain size it is highly likely that two people have the same birthday. The 1 365 explanation is correct but is answering a different question than what you are asking. There is 1 in 365 chance that a persons birthday will be a certain date. That may be the chance that a single pair of birthdays match. Any group larger than two provides multiple pairs. The odds go up as the group gets larger. Figuring out how that impacts the odds means figuring out the number of possible pairs (see Birthday problem on Wikipedia or Ask Dr. Math FAQ: The Birthday Problem on Drexel Math Forum). The number of possible pairs goes up much more rapidly than our intuition tells us. To make it more than even money our intuition tells us hundreds, but the reality is a couple of dozen people is enough. 3.9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!
