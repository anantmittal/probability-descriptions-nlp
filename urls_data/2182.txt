Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics)  Life and Living What is the probability of being born on February 29? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Shubham Sharma , Machine Learning student.Completed stats110 (Joe Blitzstein). Answered Mar 6, 2016 · Author has 65 answers and 177.6k answer views Let F 29 be the event that a person is born on February 29th, and let L be the event that that a person is born on a Leap year. As a practical approximation, there are 485 leap years in 2 millennia = 2000 years, so, the probability of being born in a leap year, given a frequentist interpretation of probability, is(This is a bit of a simplication, since the probability is a little bit larger than this as we’ve assumed equal chance of years here see solution 2 which does not make this assumption). We can use Baye’s theorm to determine the solution. According to Baye’s theorem: (1) Rearranging terms in (1), we can easily solve for P ( F 29) using: (2)  We know, assuming a person is equally likely to be born in any given year. Further P ( L | F 29)= 1, since a person is born on a leap year with probability 1 if they were born on February 29th (by de nition of a leap year). If we assume that a person is equally likely to be born on any given day within a leap year, then. Using these calculations in (2) above, we have:   To be more precise you could follow this logic: there are 485 years in a 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are 485(366)+(2000 − 485)(365) = 730485 total days. Of those, days, February 29th occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is: . This second solution is a closer approximation to the true probability of being born on February 29th, since it is not subject to as much rounding error as that in (4), but  both answers are approriate. 4.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Adding 1 of leap year makes it 1461. So the probability of being born on February 29 is 1/1461.  But this is not the exact value and changes with time. Because we always take some assumptions while calculating time. So accordingly it is required to lose 3 leap days every 400 years. The reason being that Earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit around sun. We make that 365 days for 3 years and add that extra day due to approximation of 0.2422 in the fourth year but still its not accurate. 0.2422*4 = 0.9688 but we take it as one day. So to make up for it. we need to lose 3 leaps days every 400 years ( still approximation )  So for the record your answer is 1/1461 but if we take it to the next level of accuracy it changes but you may go with 1/1461. :) 3.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Abhay Mittal promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

Updated Jul 9, 2014 Quite simply the answer is 1/12. Solution: A person can have birthday in any of the 12 months of the year.Another person can also have his/her birthday in any of the 12 months.Now,the total number of possible combinations is 12*12 , which equals 144. This set of all possible combinations contains 12 pairs of identical months {for example(Jan,Jan)},which are our favorable outcomes. Thus the probability = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Number of events in sample space)= 12/(12*12)=1/12 Hope this helps. Edit: For the purpose of simplicity I have assumed all the months to have equal number of days , so as to avoid complexity. 5.9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

That is also when I prefer to celebrate it. But I will take well-wishes from friends and family whenever they come! Reason why I prefer 2/28 is that February is my birthday month. I was born on the last day of February, not into March. BTW in California if you have a legal contract that says you will perform on the 29th day of each month, then in February on non-Leap years, it becomes the 28th of the month. Thus, I could drink alcohol on 2/28 in my 21st year, instead of waiting until 3/1. Also, for celebrating purposes, it should be whenever the person wants. For example, if your friend was born on October 3rd but had a party for himself on October 5th because that fell on a weekend, you wouldn’t refuse to go, right? Because it was “not the actual birthday”? Yet some people get particular about arguing when a 2/29 person’s birthday should be celebrated. It should be celebrated whenever the birthday person wants! 5.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

When they celebrate their birthday is up to them. They can choose March 1 going with 365 days makes a year, or choose to celebrate it in February going by the same month philosophy. The effective legal date of a leapling's birthday in non-leap years varies between jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, when a person born on February 29 turns 18 in a non-leap year, they are considered to have their birthday on March 1 in the relevant year. In New Zealand, a person born on February 29 is deemed to have their birthday on February 28 in non-leap years. In England and Wales or in Hong Kong, a person born on February 29 will have legally reached 18 years old on March 1. If he or she was born in Taiwan he or she legally becomes 18 on February 28, a day earlier. In the United States, there is no statute or general rule that has anything to do with leap day.

Updated Feb 3, 2016 · Author has 55 answers and 75.7k answer views If we go logically one years means completing one revolution around sun....i.e..365 days .......so everyones birthday is after 365 days. A person born on 29 Feb completes 365 days on 1st march....so he should celebrate his birthday on 1 st march. However there is no bidding as such in India....so your choice. http://www.timeanddate.com/date/... This is a good link to calculate number of days you lived. (Link for legal rules is at the bottom of answer, if you are in search of legal bidding then visit that link) If you want more technical explanation then here we goes There are three types of years... Tropical year, which is from equinox to equinox, that is from the time the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north to the next time 365.24219 days Sidereal year, from one time a particular star is in a given position to the next time 365.25636 days Anomalistic year, from the time the Earth is at its closest to the Sun to the next time 365.25964 days. So for convinence we take a year of 365.2425 days . As a result 29 Feb is extra in every fourth year (except in years divisible by 100 but not 400). Consider , a person celebrating his birthday on 1 March.....so his/her next birthday will be on 1 March obviously. So he has to live for 365 days for next birthday to come.( not 365.25 days) But after a leap year he has to live for 366 days ( one day extra of 29 Feb) do his next birthday. So he pays  0.25 years of all his previous birthdays he waited less ( for previous four years). So if a persons birthday is on 29 Feb ...he will complete his 365 days on 1 st march.......but during next leap year when 29 feb and 1 march both exist his 366 days will be completed on 1 march not on 29 Feb. So scientifically one born on 29 Feb grows by one year on 1 st march not 28 Feb or 29 Feb. But for sake and common sense obviously on leap year one will celebrate his/ her birthday on 29 Feb.

Birthday is about celebrating 1 years of being alive; it is NOT about sticking to the day ’cause dates come after calenders do, and there are countless calenders out there, something that changes with what you take a reference to ‘synchronise’. What you really celebrate is an year of being alive. Leap year is a convenience thing, not physics, or math. They give you an extra day in the ‘human calender’ to sort of compensate for the fractional time they took away in past three years. Nature is whatever it is, we give it convenient representations, then experiment to verify that the representations are not disasters. 4.7k Views · View Upvoters   Anna Kay Answered Jun 20, 2017 Hello! I hope my answer isn't too late! Confession; I was born on the Leap Year. (I signed up just so I could answer this question) I personally celebrate my birthday on the first of March for several reasons: one is because I hadn't been born yet on the February 28th in the year I was born. But oviously, I had been born by March 1st of that year. Though March 1st isn't my birthday, it's the most accurate day on which to celebrate the anniversary of my existence.

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 3 Answers Quora User Updated Feb 6, 2018 · Author has 1k answers and 634.4k answer views Such a widespread question affecting such a wide range of people, there are probably statutes and regulations under statutes that speak to when February 29 is deemed to have occurred during years which have no February 29 (i.e., non-leap years). Putting aside legality to think precisely and logically, it doesn’t make sense for an individual whose birthday is February 29 to begin celebrating it until the possibility of there being a February 29 during any one given year is absolutely brought to an end through the application of law and the perception of fact. Legislation certainly can be referred to in order to determine which years have a February 29 and which don’t, on an ongoing basis, and it’s pretty unreasonable to expect that a legislature is likely to ever enact, or a court would ever rule, February 29 to be a part of any (legislated) non-leap year. This is not to say it’s absolutely impossible, but it would certainly be a political question that would require extraordinary legislative or judicial action in order to implement extraordinarily—as to non-leap years. And, of course, with a justification that totally escapes reason, at least to me. That said, deemed recognition at law of the occurrence of February 29 during non-leap years, and legislative direction as to when individuals born February 29 may celebrate their birthdays, are two different matters. Therefore, how’s this? “ §1.  Deemed lawful occurrence, during leap years, of birthdays of individuals born February 29 (a) During non-leap years, the birthdays of individuals born on February 29, shall not be deemed to have occurred until the last second of the last minute of the last hour of February 28 has elapsed, according to statutory, regulatory and judicial recognition as to the lapse of time as set forth elsewhere within the law of this jurisdiction. (b) (i) for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) of this section; and, (ii) for the purpose of designating a day during years which do not include the date and day described as February 29 (“année bissextile”), on which individuals whose birthdays occurred and the anniversaries of which would, during leap years, occur, on February 29, may be celebrated, that day may be deemed to be March 1 of that particular year.” 3.7k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below If you are born on February 29 of a leap year, when is your birthday?

Ask New Question   Keith Winstein Answered May 4, 2011 · Upvoted by Quora User , lurker · Author has 373 answers and 1.1m answer views In a leap year, at the start of February 29. Otherwise, probably at the start of March 1. See, e.g., DelVecchio v. Illinois Dept. of Corrections, 8 F.3d 509, 512 (7th Cir. 1993), where a man's sentence for murder hinged on this point: Under Illinois law in 1965, any male who had yet to reach his seventeenth birthday but who was convicted and sentenced as an adult was sent to the Illinois Youth Commission ("IYC") with no minimum mandatory term. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23 §§ 2523-2525 (1963). The IYC then had total discretion: it could release the boy at any time before he turned twenty-one years old, it could release him when he turned twenty-one, or it could send him to an adult penitentiary at age twenty-one at which point the offender would receive a new sentence. Id. By contrast, any male sentenced after he turned seventeen received a normal adult term of years and served his time in a penitentiary. DelVecchio's case landed in the state's attorney's office in early February 1965; DelVecchio was set to turn seventeen on March 1, 1965 (DelVecchio was born February 29, 1948, a leap year). Prosecutors, then, had they delayed sentencing for a few weeks, could have guaranteed that DelVecchio would serve time (and almost certainly more of it) in an adult institution. Here is the choice prosecutors faced: if DelVecchio were sentenced on February 28, 1965, he would go to a youth home and be eligible to be freed the next day; if he were sentenced on March 1, 1965, he would go to an adult penitentiary and receive a minimum mandatory sentence of fourteen years and possibly a sentence as high as fifty years. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, ch. 38, par. 9-1. Id. (footnote omitted). 34.2k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?   Abd Ul-Rahman Lomax , studied at California Institute of Technology Answered Nov 6, 2014 · Author has 1.9k answers and 3.5m answer views Great answer from Keith Winstein. Astronomically, a year is currently 365.25 days, minus a little. So every four years, there is a leap day, and every 100 years, not, and every 400 years, one. 2000 was a leap year, unlike 1900 or 2100, in the Gregorian calendar. However, legally, age is measured in calendar years. We don't look at the time of day of birth. If a child was born before midnight at the end of a day, they are a year old at the beginning of that date. But not the day before. They are that old for the entire year after that, until their next birthday. Legally, if someone is born on February 29, the leap day, they are not yet a year old on the next February 28. They will turn one as soon as the next day starts. I would interpret their "birthday" as being March 1 except in leap years. This is totally routine, I expect. When we go to get a drivers' license, they will look at the year and date. If  the date is not yet the birthday, we are one year less  than the difference in years. Any day after that, we are then the difference in years, old. February 28 is before February 29. February 28 is the last day that one's legal age is a year younger than the difference. So the next day is legally the "birthday."  It makes complete sense. 10.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?

An average year length is actually, on average, 365.2425 days not 365.25.  As written on the wikipedia leap year page, "The Gregorian calendar . . . removes three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its leap cycle. This is done by removing February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.[3] The years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are common years." – StatsStudent  Feb 29 '16 at 9:09         10      I don't see why you need to consider 2000 years; leap years are on a 400 year cycle, so why not just reduce to "there are 97 leap years in 400 years"? – Philip Kendall  Feb 29 '16 at 12:27        7      Why should we consider such minor influences as "cancelled" leap days in century years not multiples of 400 but on the other hand not factor in external influences, such as almost all births being delayed past or introduced before the 29th of February, just to save the child from the inconvenience (or other reasons)? - At least here in Germany the probability for a birth to occur on any 29th of February is (estimated) nearly zero. – Alexander Kosubek  Feb 29 '16 at 13:02        |  show 15 more comments             up vote  23  down vote      To accurately predict that probability using statistics, it would be helpful to know where the birth took place.  This page http://chmullig.com/2012/06/births-by-day-of-year/ has a graph showing a subset of the number of births per day (multiplying the 29th by 4, which is incorrect, and undesirable for this question, but it also links to the original data and gives a rough indication of what you can expect) in the United States. I would assume that this curve doesn't hold true for other countries, and especially not for other continents. In particular the southern hemisphere and equatorial region may show a substantial derivation from these results - assuming that climate is a determining factor.  Furthermore, there's the issue of "elective birth" (touched upon by the authors of http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e002920.full ) - in poorer regions of the globe, I would expect a different distribution of births, simply because (non-emergency-) cesarian sections or induced birth are rarer than in developed countries. This skews the final distribution of births.  Using the American data, assuming ~71 Million births (rough graphed mean * 366) and 46.000 births on February 29ths, not correcting for the distribution of leap years in the data, because the precise period is not indicated, I arrive at a probability of around ~0.000648. This is slightly below the value one would expect given a flat distribution of births, and thus in line with the general impression give by the graph.  I'll leave a significance test of this rough estimation to a motivated reader. But given that the 29th (though uncorrected - the year 2000 injects a below average bias into the data) scores low even for the already low February standards, I assume a relatively high confidence that the null-hypthosesis of equal distribution can be rejected.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 7:26             answered Feb 29 '16 at 13:17       Rick Moritz   331 1 4                  The data set has Feb 30 and 31 dates of birth.

Any theoretical answer would be flawed without accounting birthday selection phenomena, seasonality etc. These things are impossible to deal with theoretically.  The birthday data is hard to find in US for privacy reasons. There's one anonymous data set here . It's from insurance applications in USA. The difference from other reports, such as a popular often cited NYT article , is that it lists the frequency of births by date, instead of simple ranking of days in a year. The weak point is of course the sampling bias, since it comes from insurance: uninsured people are not included etc.  According to the data there were 325 births in Feb 29 of total 481040. According to the Roy Murphy , the sample spans from 1981 through 1994. It includes 3 leap years of total 14 years. Without any adjustments the probability would be 0.0675% of being born on Feb 29 between 1981 and 1994.  You can adjust the probability by accounting for the frequency of leap years, which is close to 1/4 ( not exactly though ), e.g. by multiplying this number by $14/12$ to arrive to 0.079% estimate. Here, the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 in a leap year is linked to the observed frequency $F_o=325$ by the frequency $f_L=3$ of leap years in a sample:
$$F_o=f_L/N\cdot F\cdot p,$$
where $N=14$ is the number of years in a sample, and $F=481040$ is the total frequency of births.  Normally, the probability of leap years is $p_L\approx 1/4$, hence, the long run average probability $P_L$ of being born on Feb 29 is:
$$P_L=p_L\cdot p\approx \frac{p_L\cdot N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F} \approx 0.079\%$$  You might be interested in the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 given that you were born on leap year:
$$p= \frac{N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F}\approx 0.32\%$$  So, the link between $P_L$ and $p$ is based on some couple of assumptions, e.g. that the probability of being born in any given year is uniform, and doesn't change.  Of course, this discussion was US centric. Who knows what are the patterns in other countries.  UPDATE: We automatically assumed that OP is Gregorian calendar. It gets even more interesting if you consider different calendars such as lunar calendar Hijri , where the leap years are every 30 years or so.  UPDATE 2:  What's surprising is that estimated probability $p$ leads to the expected occurrence of birthdays in Feb 29 for this sample: $F\cdot p=1,527$. This is only lower than Jan 1 and Dec 25, which is consistent with NYT's ranking above! They don't describe the source of data, referring to only Amitabh Chandra, Harvard University , but it's either the same or the finding is robust.  Now, how likely it is that very peculiar days in Gregorian calendar: Jan 1, Dec 25 and Deb 29 would come randomly as the most popular birthdays? I say it's highly unlikely a random occurrence. Hence, it's even more interesting to see what's going on in other calendars such as Hijri.  UPDATE 3:  Note that both $P_L,p$ are higher than naive theoretical estimates:  $$\hat p\approx 1/366\approx 0.27%$$
$$\hat P_L\approx p\cdot\frac{366}{365*4+1}\approx 0.068%$$  UPDATE 4:  Ben Millwood made comment that the distribution of births by day of year is non-uniform. Can we test this statement? Using my data set we can run $\chi^2$ test on the theoretical distribution with a null hypothesis that the distribution is uniform. The result is the rejection, i.e. the distribution doesn't seem to be uniform.  The theoretical distribution is built like this. We assume that the birth frequency is uniform across all calendar days, i.e. in 14 years span across $14*365+3$ days. Then we roll up the days into days of year, which is 366. Obviously only 3 leap days were encountered and 14 non-leap days. Below is my MATLAB code and the distribution plot for comparison of theoretical and empiricals.  d=[0101 1482

For instance, you have a web site and want to flag problematic user data. You could compare the frequency of Feb 29 birthdays with my probabilities. However, if you are planning a family and asking this question, then my numbers are useless, pretty much. The reason is that they don't account for factors such as when exactly the couple is actually copulating or fertility and period patterns of couples, for instance, which is the main determinant of the birth day date. – Aksakal  Feb 29 '16 at 16:53            Glad to see you did not start with the math before considering other factors, beyond pure stats – TheBlastOne  Mar 1 '16 at 7:02        add a comment |             up vote  8  down vote      The cover to my favorite book ever provides some highly relevant evidence against the assumption of a uniform allocation of births to dates. Specifically that births in the US since 1970 exhibit several trends superimposed on eachother: a long, multi-decade trend, a non-periodic trend, day-of-week trends, day-of-year trends, holiday trends (because procedures like Cesarean section allow one to effectively schedule the birthdate, and doctors often don't do those on holidays). The result is that the probability of being born on a randomly-chosen day in a year is not uniform, and because birth rate varies between years, not all years are equally likely, either. So the answer that just checks how many leap years there are in some interval and reckons from the calendar is making very strong assumptions which have little utility in describing the real world in any reasonable way!  This also provides evidence that Asksal's solution, while a very strong contender, is also incomplete. A small number of leap days will be "contaminated" by all off the effects at play here, so Asksal's estimate is also capturing (quite by accident) the effect of day-of-week and long-term trends along with the Feb. 29 effect. Which effects are and are not appropriate to include are not clearly defined by your question.  And this analysis only has bearing on the US, which has demographic trends which might be quite different from other nations or populations. Japan's birth rate has been declining for decades, for example. China's birth rate is regulated by the state, with some consequences for its nation's gender composition and hence birth rates in subsequent generations.  Likewise, Gelman's analysis only describes several recent decades, and it's not necessarily clear that this is even the era of interest to your question.   For those who get excited about this kind of thing, the material in the cover is discussed at length in the chapter on Gaussian processes.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 20:37       whuber ♦   188k 28 399 739        answered Mar 1 '16 at 13:50       Sycorax   25.5k 5 70 110              2      A brief description of the model used in also available in the blog post here: andrewgelman.com/2012/06/19/… – Sakari Cajanus  Mar 2 '16 at 14:15        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      February 29th is a date that occurs each year that is a multiple of 4 .  However years that are a multiple of 100 but aren't one of 400, are not considered as leap years (E.g: 1900 is not a leap year while 2000 or 1600 are). Therefore, nowadays, it is the same pattern every 400 years.  So let's do the maths on a [0;400[ interval:  On a 400 years period, there is exactly 4 x 25 = 100 years that are a multiple of 4 . But we have to subtract 3 (years multiple of 100 but not of 400) from 100, and we get 100 - 3 = 97 Now we have to multiply 97 by 366 , 97 x 366 = 35502 (365 x (400-97)) = 110 595 Then we just have to add these two numbers in order to know the total number of days in a 400 years period: 110 595 + 35502 = 146 097 To finish, our probability is the number of February 29th in a 400 years period so 97 given that there is 97 leap years divided by the total number of days of our interval: p = 97 / 146097 ≈ 0,0006639424492 Hope this is right and clear.   share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 29 '16 at 15:23       Jonathan Poid   31 1            7      This is a nice analysis of the chance that a randomly chosen date would be February 29th.  I believe most of the discussion in this thread focuses on the fact that this doesn't actually answer questions about chances of births, which do not really behave like random draws from the set of possible days. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 15:28        1      A much easier way is to say that there are 97 leap years per 400 years the way you have already worked out. Calculate the number of days in 400 normal years. 400 * 365 = 146000. Then you need to add the 97 leap days giving 146097. – CJ Dennis  Mar 1 '16 at 7:06        add a comment |         up vote  2  down vote      I believe there are two questions being mixed up here. The one is "What is the probability of any given day being a Feb. 29th?". The second one is (and the one actually asked) "What is the probability of being born on a leap day?"  The approach of simply counting days seems to be misleading as Aksakal is pointing it. Counting days and calculating frequencies of Feb. 29th occuring addresses the question: "What is the probability that any given day is a Feb. 29th?" (Imagine waking up after a coma, no clue what day it is. The probability of it being a Feb. 29th is as pointed out above $p = \frac{97}{146097}\approx 0,00066394$).  Following Aksakal's answer, the probability can just be based on empirical studies of the distribution of births across the days of the year. Different data sets will come to different conclusions (e.g. due to effects of seasonality, long-term trends in birth rates, cultural differences). Aksakal pointed out a study (One comment: to account for the unrepresentative occurence of a leap year in the mentioned data (i.e. $\frac{3}{14}$) compared to the long-term frequency of leap year occurences (i.e. $\frac{97}{400}$) you would have to multiply the frequency of birth on Feb. 29th from the sample by $\frac{97}{400}\cdot\frac{14}{3} = \frac{679}{600} \approx 1.131667$).  Finally, there is a third possible interpretation of the question, which I believe was not intended though: "What is the probability of a specific person being born on a leap day?" Well, for anyone already born that is easy. It is either $0$ or $1$. For anyone not born but already conceived it also can be estimated using empirical studies on the length of pregnancy (see Wikipedia for an overview ). For anyone not conceived yet, see above.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 8:20       mpiktas   27.7k 4 62 121        answered Feb 29 '16 at 16:32       data_enthusiast   34 4              2      Errr, I was ready to vote this up, and then I got to Well, for anyone already born that is easy.

I looked at it and know the outcome (e.g. heads). You are standing next to me, but have not seen the outcome. What is the probability of the coin showing heads (for you, for me, "objectively")? In the example above: for the given (born) person the probability is either 0 or 1 (assuming he knows on which date he is born). If you pick a person at random and you had to guess his birthday, the probability it being a Feb. 29 is than again an empirical question. – data_enthusiast  Mar 3 '16 at 8:53         add a comment |           up vote  1  down vote      I've noticed that most of the answers above work this out by calculating the number of leap days in a particular period. There is a simpler way to get the answer, 100% accurately, by definition:  We use leap years to adjust the regular (365 day) calendar to the mean tropical year (aka mean solar year). The mean tropical year "is the time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth" (Wikipedia). The tropical year varies slightly, but the mean (average) tropical year is ABOUT 365.24667.  If out leap days are correct, then the chance of a randomly selected day being a leap day, is ((tropical year) - (non-leap-year)) / tropical year  Pluging in the approximate number we have, it's (365.24667-365)/365.24667, or 0.24667/365.24667, or 675 per million (0.0675%).  This, however, is for a randomly selected day. I imagine that this is substantially skewed by parents who would rather not have to explain to their kids, "your actual birthday only comes once per 4 years".     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 1 '16 at 21:51       AMADANON Inc.   111 2              2      I don't think this answers the question being asked, because the leap day, Feb. 29, only exists in particular calendar systems. Those calendar systems have only been in use in particular societies during the recent historical eras. For example, this question is not intelligible to someone who reckons time using the Hebrew calendar, which has no "February" at all! Moreover, even if we assume a calendar with a leap day, it still doesn't resolve the indeterminacy surrounding the probability distribution of births to days. – Sycorax  Mar 1 '16 at 22:25            @user777, thats irrelevant.

It's About As Rare As You'd Think By Claire Warner Feb 28 2016 As your Facebook feed has no doubt made you aware, Feb. 29 is just around the corner, and there's one thing on everyone's minds: What are the odds of being born on a leap year? Most people find leaplings, as they're called by local-interest pieces and adoring grandmothers, inexplicably fascinating out of a perception that leap year birthdays are incredibly rare. But popular opinion is rarely 100 percent correct (see: every myth about the menstrual cycle ever). Are your chances of being born on a leap year actually that low? For once, the general public has the right idea, because the odds of a leap year birthday are usually estimated to be one in 1,461 . The statistics behind the number are surprisingly simple: Four years is equal to 1,460 days, and the leap year rounds it up to 1,461. Assuming the odds of being born are the same for every day, your chances of being a leapling turn out to be one in 1,461. That being said, it's not that rare; for example, your odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime are one in 3,000 , and your chances of becoming POTUS are one in 10,000,000. By comparison, being born on a leap year seems like no biggie. However, as the BBC points out, this may oversimplify things; it's well-known that human births vary based on season and location . A 2014 study found that peak birth months occur earlier in the year the further you get from the equator, and the Centers for Disease Control suggest that August is the most popular birth month in America. So in reality, your chances are probably a little less than the statistic cited above, but there's little specific research on the subject. Leap years are used as a way to reconcile the Earth's imperfect orbit with the Gregorian calendar used in most Western countries. Our calendar has 365 days, but the planet actually takes 365.24 days to go around the Sun. The disparity may not seem like much, but the extra time can (and did) build up over the course of centuries unless you account for it. When Julius Caesar came into power, the calendar was something of a mess, as the priesthood hadn't done a great job of keeping up with the convoluted system of the time. Caesar ordered the astronomer Sosigenes to create a new calendar, and he came up with 365-day system that tacked on an extra day every four years. This was later fine-tuned by Pope Gregorious XIII , and voila! You have the Gregorian calendar we still use today. If you were born on a leap year and find yourself so over all the "technically you're still a kid, har har!" jokes, you know who to blame. Thanks, Pope Gregorious XIII.

No longer would I flash a doctored Connecticut license and pose as a haggard 42-year-old Stonington man named Kurt. At the stroke of midnight, I could buy a beer legally. The barkeep slid my license back. “I can’t serve you,” he said. He thought my real ID was fake. Who, after all, has February 29 for their birthday? I protested, but it was no use. “Plus,” he said. “It’s February 28. Come back tomorrow.” Related Story      How Will You Spend Today's 'Leap Second'?  Here’s the thing about birthdays: They happen each year. That’s a birthday’s job: You turn a year older, whether you blow out the candles on the cake or not. Unless you don’t have a birthday. For 187,000 of us in the U.S., that’s what happens three-quarters of the time. We leaplings, as we’re called, have defied 1-in-1,461 odds to have our birthdays fall on February 29. Some would figure that makes us special. It depends on how you look at it. News reports in secondary markets sometimes feature leap-day births or an octogenarian leaper’s 20th. Back in 2008, Martha Stewart hosted 200 leapers on her show. They wore frog-mouth name tags (frogs leap, get it?). “I think you’re all so lucky!” Stewart said, sort of sincerely. She gave them each state-of-the-art digital picture frames. Leapsters keep two sets of ages, annual and quadrennial. We mark time between real birthdays in fourths and halves. Leap-year days serve a purpose, as we know: The extra day tacked onto the end of February every four years accounts for Earth’s spinning around the sun five hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds longer than 365 days. In 46 B.C., Julius Caesar noticed the calendar had fallen behind 90 days and tried to correct the difference, and added days here and there to months on the calendar for one year, adding a leap day every four years thereafter. This still needed tweaking: By 1582, with 11 minutes a year left unadjusted, the calendar had shifted 10 days. The Gregorian reform of the Julian calendar introduced an extra day to make up the difference, with leap years of centuries divisible by four skipped. Whatever. The bottom line is, I turn 12 this year, and I have Pope Gregory XIII and my mother to thank for it. Leaplings have formed clubs over the years, like The Order of 29’ers, set up by a newspaper editor in Pittsburg, Kansas, in the early part of the last century. Since 1988, Anthony, Texas, has championed itself as the Leap Year Capital of the World: In 2012, the town’s three-day celebration included a car show, an ice hockey game, and a golf tournament. At the website of the Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies (“spreading Leap Year day awareness” for 19 years), fellow leapsters and leapettes share tales of woe: children who thought their birthdays were taken away, parents begging and bribing doctors to fudge kids’ birth certificates to February 28 or March 1. The date seems to confound petty bureaucrats and government factotum alike. “When I moved to Oregon and went to get my driver’s license I was told there is no February 29,” Raenell Dawn, the co-founder of the Honor Society, who turns 14 (56) this year, tells me. “The DMV employee actually said to me ‘Are you sure it’s February 29?’ As if I wasn’t sure of my own birth date!” Leapsters fall into two schools. There are those who think it’s a unique quirk, like having double-jointed thumbs or keeping an AOL account. And then there are those who think it’s no big deal. “All I do is spend time with my family and close friends,” Antonio Sabáto, Jr., the actor and former Calvin Klein model (born February 29, 1972), writes to me on Twitter. “Good enough for me.” I haven’t heard back from the rapper and actor Ja Rule (born February 29, 1976) or the motivational speaker Tony Robbins (born February 29, 1960), so I assume being an actual celebrity trumps leapster status. The bottom line is I turn 12 this year, and I have Pope Gregory XIII and my mother to thank for it. I can’t help but think about my life more deeply every four years. Thinking in four-year periods isn’t uncommon—we have summer Olympics and presidential elections on leap years, after all. But, each February 29, I pause to take a life inventory. 16 to 20 marked the time from high school to college. From 36 to 40, I became a father and moved out of New York City. There isn’t much of a Leap Day birthday canon. It’s a good enough birth date for Superman, although who knows what calendar the planet Krypton uses. Leapsters do have children’s books (sample titles: It’s My Birthday ... Finally! and Mommy, Where’s My Birthday? ) and a young adult title ( Leap Day ). Probability theorists have a famous exercise called the “Birthday Problem.” First proposed by the engineer and mathematician Richard von Mises in 1939, the Birthday Problem determines the probability of a match in birth date given any number of people in the same room. (The probability reaches one half at 23 people.) In the original set-up and others, however, Leap Day birthdays are excluded to keep things uniform. Perhaps the most famous leap-day plot device appears in the 1879 Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates of Penzance . Frederic, enslaved to pirates until he turned 21, is convinced to stay until he turns 84 because of his February 29 birthday. “You are the victim of this clumsy arrangement,” goes the lyric for the opera’s leap-year song, “Paradox.” And then there’s Facebook, which bugs users to wish a happy birthday to close friends, family, and the pharma sales rep they sat next to on a plane that one time. Facebook tells the world my birthday falls on February 28 by default. For leapsters who celebrate on March 1 (about half of my leapling brethren are not, like me, strict “Februarians”), this is enough to ruin a birthday. Unless, of course, you just change your birthday to March 1. But the clumsiness of the arrangement is often enough to make me want to throw a fit. Just like a 12-year-old.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.

T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

You may assume a 365 day year and that all months have the same probability (which they do not). You solve this the same way that you solve the original Birthday Problem. First, determine the probability that all four people are born in different months: The first person could be born in any of the 12 months: (12/12) The second person could be born in any of the 11 months remaining: (11/12) The third person could be born in any of the 10 remaining months: (10/12) The fourth person could be born in any of the 9 remaining months: (9/12) So the probability that all four are born in different months is:  Therefore the probability that at least 2 of them are born in the same month is   But this is assuming that the probabilities for the months are equal, but in fact, they are not.   Seven months have 31 days,
four have 30 days, and one month has 28 days.   So, let's do this problem right! What is the probability that in a group of 4 people, at least two are born in the same month? You may assume a 365 day year, but this time, let's use the correct probabilities for the months. For each of the seven months containing 31 days, the probability of being born in that month is 31/365. For each of the four months containing 30 days, the probability of being born in that month is 30/365. For February which contains 28 days, the probability of being born in that month is 28/365. Now, we solve this problem in a similar manner to the one above.    We must figure out the probability that all four are born in different months, and then subtract that number from 1 to get the probability that at least two are born in the same month. We must first determine the number of combinations of four DIFFERENT months.    Using 12 C 4 , we get 495 different combinations of 12 months taken 4 at a tiime.   Luckily, we can break this down into nine categories since many of those 495 combinations would have the same probability: JAN-FEB-MAR-APR would have the same probability as JAN-FEB-SEP-DEC because they each have two months with 31 days, 1 month with 30 days, and 1 month with 28 days.  So, here are the nine categories:    Category  1st Month  2nd Month  3rd Month  4th Month  Number of Combinations    #1  31  31  31  31   7 C 4 = 35    #2  30  30  30  30   4 C 4 = 1    #3  31  31  31  30   7 C 3 x 4 = 140    #4  31  31  31  28   7 C 3 x 1 = 35    #5  31  31  30  30   7 C 2 x 4 C 2 = 21 x 6 = 126    #6  31  31  30  28   7 C 2 x 4 x 1 = 21 x 4 x 1 = 84    #7  31  30  30  30  7 x 4 C 3 = 7 x 4 = 28    #8  31  30  30  28  7 x 4 C 2 x 1 = 42    #9  30  30  30  28   4 C 3 x 1 = 4    Total          495    Now the next table shows the probabilty that all four people have different birth months for each of the nine categories:    Category  1st Month  2nd Month  3rd Month  4th Month  Probability that all are different    #1  31  31  31  31  (31/365) 4 = .00005203    #2  30  30  30  30  (30/365) 4 = .00004564    #3  31  31  31  30  (31/365) 3 x 30/365 = .00005036    #4  31  31  31  28  (31/365) 3 x 28/365 = .00004700    #5  31  31  30  30  (31/365) 2 x (30/365) 2 = .00004873    #6  31  31  30  28  (31/365) 2 x 30/365 x 28/365 = .00004548    #7  31  30  30  30  31/365 x (30/365) 3 = .00004716    #8  31  30  30  28  31/365 x (30/365) 2 x 28/365 = .00004014    #9  30  30  30  28  (30/365) 3 x 28/365  = .00004259    Now, we must combine the two tables to obtain the sum of all 495 combinations: Sum =   35 x .00005203   +   
	 1 x .00004564   +   
       140 x .00005036   + 35 x .00004700   +   
       126 x .00004873   +   
	84 x .00004548   + 28 x .00004716   +   
	42 x .00004014   +   
	 4 x .00004259 =      .02369911 However, this only represents the nine  combinations.    We have computed the probabilities for each combination of four months.   
But we have ignored the possibility of the four people having different birth months within the same category. For example: Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in FEB, Carol in MAR, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in FEB, Carol in APR, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in MAR, Carol in FEB, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in MAR, Carol in APR, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in APR, Carol in FEB, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in APR, Carol in MAR, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in JAN, Carol in MAR, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in JAN, Carol in APR, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in MAR, Carol in JAN, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in MAR, Carol in APR, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in APR, Carol in MAR, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in APR, Carol in JAN, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in JAN, Carol in FEB, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in JAN, Carol in APR, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in FEB, Carol in JAN, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in FEB, Carol in APR, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in APR, Carol in JAN, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in APR, Carol in FEB, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in JAN, Carol in FEB, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in JAN, Carol in MAR, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in FEB, Carol in MAR, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in FEB, Carol in JAN, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in MAR, Carol in JAN, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in MAR, Carol in FEB, and David in JAN; or So, for each category of four months, there are 24 permutations! So, we must multiply our probability sum by 24 to get 24 x .02369911 = .56877864. This means that the probability that four people will have different birth months is .56877864. And finally, the probability that at least two of the four are born in the same month is 1 - .56877864 = .43122136 or 43.12%. What I find interesting is that it is very close to the probability above!    Assuming all months have the same probability, we got 42.71%.

Answered Mar 6, 2016 · Author has 65 answers and 177.6k answer views Let F 29 be the event that a person is born on February 29th, and let L be the event that that a person is born on a Leap year. As a practical approximation, there are 485 leap years in 2 millennia = 2000 years, so, the probability of being born in a leap year, given a frequentist interpretation of probability, is(This is a bit of a simplication, since the probability is a little bit larger than this as we’ve assumed equal chance of years here see solution 2 which does not make this assumption). We can use Baye’s theorm to determine the solution. According to Baye’s theorem: (1) Rearranging terms in (1), we can easily solve for P ( F 29) using: (2)  We know, assuming a person is equally likely to be born in any given year. Further P ( L | F 29)= 1, since a person is born on a leap year with probability 1 if they were born on February 29th (by de nition of a leap year). If we assume that a person is equally likely to be born on any given day within a leap year, then. Using these calculations in (2) above, we have:   To be more precise you could follow this logic: there are 485 years in a 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are 485(366)+(2000 − 485)(365) = 730485 total days. Of those, days, February 29th occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is: . This second solution is a closer approximation to the true probability of being born on February 29th, since it is not subject to as much rounding error as that in (4), but  both answers are approriate. 4.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Adding 1 of leap year makes it 1461. So the probability of being born on February 29 is 1/1461.  But this is not the exact value and changes with time. Because we always take some assumptions while calculating time. So accordingly it is required to lose 3 leap days every 400 years. The reason being that Earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit around sun. We make that 365 days for 3 years and add that extra day due to approximation of 0.2422 in the fourth year but still its not accurate. 0.2422*4 = 0.9688 but we take it as one day. So to make up for it. we need to lose 3 leaps days every 400 years ( still approximation )  So for the record your answer is 1/1461 but if we take it to the next level of accuracy it changes but you may go with 1/1461. :) 3.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Abhay Mittal promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

Updated Jul 9, 2014 Quite simply the answer is 1/12. Solution: A person can have birthday in any of the 12 months of the year.Another person can also have his/her birthday in any of the 12 months.Now,the total number of possible combinations is 12*12 , which equals 144. This set of all possible combinations contains 12 pairs of identical months {for example(Jan,Jan)},which are our favorable outcomes. Thus the probability = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Number of events in sample space)= 12/(12*12)=1/12 Hope this helps. Edit: For the purpose of simplicity I have assumed all the months to have equal number of days , so as to avoid complexity. 5.9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

That is also when I prefer to celebrate it. But I will take well-wishes from friends and family whenever they come! Reason why I prefer 2/28 is that February is my birthday month. I was born on the last day of February, not into March. BTW in California if you have a legal contract that says you will perform on the 29th day of each month, then in February on non-Leap years, it becomes the 28th of the month. Thus, I could drink alcohol on 2/28 in my 21st year, instead of waiting until 3/1. Also, for celebrating purposes, it should be whenever the person wants. For example, if your friend was born on October 3rd but had a party for himself on October 5th because that fell on a weekend, you wouldn’t refuse to go, right? Because it was “not the actual birthday”? Yet some people get particular about arguing when a 2/29 person’s birthday should be celebrated. It should be celebrated whenever the birthday person wants! 5.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

When they celebrate their birthday is up to them. They can choose March 1 going with 365 days makes a year, or choose to celebrate it in February going by the same month philosophy. The effective legal date of a leapling's birthday in non-leap years varies between jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, when a person born on February 29 turns 18 in a non-leap year, they are considered to have their birthday on March 1 in the relevant year. In New Zealand, a person born on February 29 is deemed to have their birthday on February 28 in non-leap years. In England and Wales or in Hong Kong, a person born on February 29 will have legally reached 18 years old on March 1. If he or she was born in Taiwan he or she legally becomes 18 on February 28, a day earlier. In the United States, there is no statute or general rule that has anything to do with leap day.

Updated Feb 3, 2016 · Author has 55 answers and 75.7k answer views If we go logically one years means completing one revolution around sun....i.e..365 days .......so everyones birthday is after 365 days. A person born on 29 Feb completes 365 days on 1st march....so he should celebrate his birthday on 1 st march. However there is no bidding as such in India....so your choice. http://www.timeanddate.com/date/... This is a good link to calculate number of days you lived. (Link for legal rules is at the bottom of answer, if you are in search of legal bidding then visit that link) If you want more technical explanation then here we goes There are three types of years... Tropical year, which is from equinox to equinox, that is from the time the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north to the next time 365.24219 days Sidereal year, from one time a particular star is in a given position to the next time 365.25636 days Anomalistic year, from the time the Earth is at its closest to the Sun to the next time 365.25964 days. So for convinence we take a year of 365.2425 days . As a result 29 Feb is extra in every fourth year (except in years divisible by 100 but not 400). Consider , a person celebrating his birthday on 1 March.....so his/her next birthday will be on 1 March obviously. So he has to live for 365 days for next birthday to come.( not 365.25 days) But after a leap year he has to live for 366 days ( one day extra of 29 Feb) do his next birthday. So he pays  0.25 years of all his previous birthdays he waited less ( for previous four years). So if a persons birthday is on 29 Feb ...he will complete his 365 days on 1 st march.......but during next leap year when 29 feb and 1 march both exist his 366 days will be completed on 1 march not on 29 Feb. So scientifically one born on 29 Feb grows by one year on 1 st march not 28 Feb or 29 Feb. But for sake and common sense obviously on leap year one will celebrate his/ her birthday on 29 Feb.

Birthday is about celebrating 1 years of being alive; it is NOT about sticking to the day ’cause dates come after calenders do, and there are countless calenders out there, something that changes with what you take a reference to ‘synchronise’. What you really celebrate is an year of being alive. Leap year is a convenience thing, not physics, or math. They give you an extra day in the ‘human calender’ to sort of compensate for the fractional time they took away in past three years. Nature is whatever it is, we give it convenient representations, then experiment to verify that the representations are not disasters. 4.7k Views · View Upvoters   Anna Kay Answered Jun 20, 2017 Hello! I hope my answer isn't too late! Confession; I was born on the Leap Year. (I signed up just so I could answer this question) I personally celebrate my birthday on the first of March for several reasons: one is because I hadn't been born yet on the February 28th in the year I was born. But oviously, I had been born by March 1st of that year. Though March 1st isn't my birthday, it's the most accurate day on which to celebrate the anniversary of my existence. Another reason is because I was actually born at 11:59 p.m… just seconds away from being born on March 1st. However, I have never met anyone else born on the Leap Year. I don't know when others would choose to celebrate their birthdays. I suppose it just depends on their preferences and the circumstances.

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 3 Answers Quora User Updated Feb 6, 2018 · Author has 1k answers and 634.4k answer views Such a widespread question affecting such a wide range of people, there are probably statutes and regulations under statutes that speak to when February 29 is deemed to have occurred during years which have no February 29 (i.e., non-leap years). Putting aside legality to think precisely and logically, it doesn’t make sense for an individual whose birthday is February 29 to begin celebrating it until the possibility of there being a February 29 during any one given year is absolutely brought to an end through the application of law and the perception of fact. Legislation certainly can be referred to in order to determine which years have a February 29 and which don’t, on an ongoing basis, and it’s pretty unreasonable to expect that a legislature is likely to ever enact, or a court would ever rule, February 29 to be a part of any (legislated) non-leap year. This is not to say it’s absolutely impossible, but it would certainly be a political question that would require extraordinary legislative or judicial action in order to implement extraordinarily—as to non-leap years. And, of course, with a justification that totally escapes reason, at least to me. That said, deemed recognition at law of the occurrence of February 29 during non-leap years, and legislative direction as to when individuals born February 29 may celebrate their birthdays, are two different matters. Therefore, how’s this? “ §1.  Deemed lawful occurrence, during leap years, of birthdays of individuals born February 29 (a) During non-leap years, the birthdays of individuals born on February 29, shall not be deemed to have occurred until the last second of the last minute of the last hour of February 28 has elapsed, according to statutory, regulatory and judicial recognition as to the lapse of time as set forth elsewhere within the law of this jurisdiction. (b) (i) for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) of this section; and, (ii) for the purpose of designating a day during years which do not include the date and day described as February 29 (“année bissextile”), on which individuals whose birthdays occurred and the anniversaries of which would, during leap years, occur, on February 29, may be celebrated, that day may be deemed to be March 1 of that particular year.” 3.7k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below If you are born on February 29 of a leap year, when is your birthday?

Ask New Question   Keith Winstein Answered May 4, 2011 · Upvoted by Quora User , lurker · Author has 373 answers and 1.1m answer views In a leap year, at the start of February 29. Otherwise, probably at the start of March 1. See, e.g., DelVecchio v. Illinois Dept. of Corrections, 8 F.3d 509, 512 (7th Cir. 1993), where a man's sentence for murder hinged on this point: Under Illinois law in 1965, any male who had yet to reach his seventeenth birthday but who was convicted and sentenced as an adult was sent to the Illinois Youth Commission ("IYC") with no minimum mandatory term. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23 §§ 2523-2525 (1963). The IYC then had total discretion: it could release the boy at any time before he turned twenty-one years old, it could release him when he turned twenty-one, or it could send him to an adult penitentiary at age twenty-one at which point the offender would receive a new sentence. Id. By contrast, any male sentenced after he turned seventeen received a normal adult term of years and served his time in a penitentiary. DelVecchio's case landed in the state's attorney's office in early February 1965; DelVecchio was set to turn seventeen on March 1, 1965 (DelVecchio was born February 29, 1948, a leap year). Prosecutors, then, had they delayed sentencing for a few weeks, could have guaranteed that DelVecchio would serve time (and almost certainly more of it) in an adult institution. Here is the choice prosecutors faced: if DelVecchio were sentenced on February 28, 1965, he would go to a youth home and be eligible to be freed the next day; if he were sentenced on March 1, 1965, he would go to an adult penitentiary and receive a minimum mandatory sentence of fourteen years and possibly a sentence as high as fifty years. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, ch. 38, par. 9-1. Id. (footnote omitted). 34.2k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?   Abd Ul-Rahman Lomax , studied at California Institute of Technology Answered Nov 6, 2014 · Author has 1.9k answers and 3.5m answer views Great answer from Keith Winstein. Astronomically, a year is currently 365.25 days, minus a little. So every four years, there is a leap day, and every 100 years, not, and every 400 years, one. 2000 was a leap year, unlike 1900 or 2100, in the Gregorian calendar. However, legally, age is measured in calendar years. We don't look at the time of day of birth. If a child was born before midnight at the end of a day, they are a year old at the beginning of that date. But not the day before. They are that old for the entire year after that, until their next birthday. Legally, if someone is born on February 29, the leap day, they are not yet a year old on the next February 28. They will turn one as soon as the next day starts. I would interpret their "birthday" as being March 1 except in leap years. This is totally routine, I expect. When we go to get a drivers' license, they will look at the year and date. If  the date is not yet the birthday, we are one year less  than the difference in years. Any day after that, we are then the difference in years, old. February 28 is before February 29. February 28 is the last day that one's legal age is a year younger than the difference. So the next day is legally the "birthday."  It makes complete sense. 10.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?

An average year length is actually, on average, 365.2425 days not 365.25.  As written on the wikipedia leap year page, "The Gregorian calendar . . . removes three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its leap cycle. This is done by removing February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.[3] The years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are common years." – StatsStudent  Feb 29 '16 at 9:09         10      I don't see why you need to consider 2000 years; leap years are on a 400 year cycle, so why not just reduce to "there are 97 leap years in 400 years"? – Philip Kendall  Feb 29 '16 at 12:27        7      Why should we consider such minor influences as "cancelled" leap days in century years not multiples of 400 but on the other hand not factor in external influences, such as almost all births being delayed past or introduced before the 29th of February, just to save the child from the inconvenience (or other reasons)? - At least here in Germany the probability for a birth to occur on any 29th of February is (estimated) nearly zero. – Alexander Kosubek  Feb 29 '16 at 13:02        |  show 15 more comments             up vote  23  down vote      To accurately predict that probability using statistics, it would be helpful to know where the birth took place.  This page http://chmullig.com/2012/06/births-by-day-of-year/ has a graph showing a subset of the number of births per day (multiplying the 29th by 4, which is incorrect, and undesirable for this question, but it also links to the original data and gives a rough indication of what you can expect) in the United States. I would assume that this curve doesn't hold true for other countries, and especially not for other continents. In particular the southern hemisphere and equatorial region may show a substantial derivation from these results - assuming that climate is a determining factor.  Furthermore, there's the issue of "elective birth" (touched upon by the authors of http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e002920.full ) - in poorer regions of the globe, I would expect a different distribution of births, simply because (non-emergency-) cesarian sections or induced birth are rarer than in developed countries. This skews the final distribution of births.  Using the American data, assuming ~71 Million births (rough graphed mean * 366) and 46.000 births on February 29ths, not correcting for the distribution of leap years in the data, because the precise period is not indicated, I arrive at a probability of around ~0.000648. This is slightly below the value one would expect given a flat distribution of births, and thus in line with the general impression give by the graph.  I'll leave a significance test of this rough estimation to a motivated reader. But given that the 29th (though uncorrected - the year 2000 injects a below average bias into the data) scores low even for the already low February standards, I assume a relatively high confidence that the null-hypthosesis of equal distribution can be rejected.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 7:26             answered Feb 29 '16 at 13:17       Rick Moritz   331 1 4                  The data set has Feb 30 and 31 dates of birth.

Any theoretical answer would be flawed without accounting birthday selection phenomena, seasonality etc. These things are impossible to deal with theoretically.  The birthday data is hard to find in US for privacy reasons. There's one anonymous data set here . It's from insurance applications in USA. The difference from other reports, such as a popular often cited NYT article , is that it lists the frequency of births by date, instead of simple ranking of days in a year. The weak point is of course the sampling bias, since it comes from insurance: uninsured people are not included etc.  According to the data there were 325 births in Feb 29 of total 481040. According to the Roy Murphy , the sample spans from 1981 through 1994. It includes 3 leap years of total 14 years. Without any adjustments the probability would be 0.0675% of being born on Feb 29 between 1981 and 1994.  You can adjust the probability by accounting for the frequency of leap years, which is close to 1/4 ( not exactly though ), e.g. by multiplying this number by $14/12$ to arrive to 0.079% estimate. Here, the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 in a leap year is linked to the observed frequency $F_o=325$ by the frequency $f_L=3$ of leap years in a sample:
$$F_o=f_L/N\cdot F\cdot p,$$
where $N=14$ is the number of years in a sample, and $F=481040$ is the total frequency of births.  Normally, the probability of leap years is $p_L\approx 1/4$, hence, the long run average probability $P_L$ of being born on Feb 29 is:
$$P_L=p_L\cdot p\approx \frac{p_L\cdot N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F} \approx 0.079\%$$  You might be interested in the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 given that you were born on leap year:
$$p= \frac{N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F}\approx 0.32\%$$  So, the link between $P_L$ and $p$ is based on some couple of assumptions, e.g. that the probability of being born in any given year is uniform, and doesn't change.  Of course, this discussion was US centric. Who knows what are the patterns in other countries.  UPDATE: We automatically assumed that OP is Gregorian calendar. It gets even more interesting if you consider different calendars such as lunar calendar Hijri , where the leap years are every 30 years or so.  UPDATE 2:  What's surprising is that estimated probability $p$ leads to the expected occurrence of birthdays in Feb 29 for this sample: $F\cdot p=1,527$. This is only lower than Jan 1 and Dec 25, which is consistent with NYT's ranking above! They don't describe the source of data, referring to only Amitabh Chandra, Harvard University , but it's either the same or the finding is robust.  Now, how likely it is that very peculiar days in Gregorian calendar: Jan 1, Dec 25 and Deb 29 would come randomly as the most popular birthdays? I say it's highly unlikely a random occurrence. Hence, it's even more interesting to see what's going on in other calendars such as Hijri.  UPDATE 3:  Note that both $P_L,p$ are higher than naive theoretical estimates:  $$\hat p\approx 1/366\approx 0.27%$$
$$\hat P_L\approx p\cdot\frac{366}{365*4+1}\approx 0.068%$$  UPDATE 4:  Ben Millwood made comment that the distribution of births by day of year is non-uniform. Can we test this statement? Using my data set we can run $\chi^2$ test on the theoretical distribution with a null hypothesis that the distribution is uniform. The result is the rejection, i.e. the distribution doesn't seem to be uniform.  The theoretical distribution is built like this. We assume that the birth frequency is uniform across all calendar days, i.e. in 14 years span across $14*365+3$ days. Then we roll up the days into days of year, which is 366. Obviously only 3 leap days were encountered and 14 non-leap days. Below is my MATLAB code and the distribution plot for comparison of theoretical and empiricals.  d=[0101 1482

For instance, you have a web site and want to flag problematic user data. You could compare the frequency of Feb 29 birthdays with my probabilities. However, if you are planning a family and asking this question, then my numbers are useless, pretty much. The reason is that they don't account for factors such as when exactly the couple is actually copulating or fertility and period patterns of couples, for instance, which is the main determinant of the birth day date. – Aksakal  Feb 29 '16 at 16:53            Glad to see you did not start with the math before considering other factors, beyond pure stats – TheBlastOne  Mar 1 '16 at 7:02        add a comment |             up vote  8  down vote      The cover to my favorite book ever provides some highly relevant evidence against the assumption of a uniform allocation of births to dates. Specifically that births in the US since 1970 exhibit several trends superimposed on eachother: a long, multi-decade trend, a non-periodic trend, day-of-week trends, day-of-year trends, holiday trends (because procedures like Cesarean section allow one to effectively schedule the birthdate, and doctors often don't do those on holidays). The result is that the probability of being born on a randomly-chosen day in a year is not uniform, and because birth rate varies between years, not all years are equally likely, either. So the answer that just checks how many leap years there are in some interval and reckons from the calendar is making very strong assumptions which have little utility in describing the real world in any reasonable way!  This also provides evidence that Asksal's solution, while a very strong contender, is also incomplete. A small number of leap days will be "contaminated" by all off the effects at play here, so Asksal's estimate is also capturing (quite by accident) the effect of day-of-week and long-term trends along with the Feb. 29 effect. Which effects are and are not appropriate to include are not clearly defined by your question.  And this analysis only has bearing on the US, which has demographic trends which might be quite different from other nations or populations. Japan's birth rate has been declining for decades, for example. China's birth rate is regulated by the state, with some consequences for its nation's gender composition and hence birth rates in subsequent generations.  Likewise, Gelman's analysis only describes several recent decades, and it's not necessarily clear that this is even the era of interest to your question.   For those who get excited about this kind of thing, the material in the cover is discussed at length in the chapter on Gaussian processes.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 20:37       whuber ♦   188k 28 399 739        answered Mar 1 '16 at 13:50       Sycorax   25.5k 5 70 110              2      A brief description of the model used in also available in the blog post here: andrewgelman.com/2012/06/19/… – Sakari Cajanus  Mar 2 '16 at 14:15        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      February 29th is a date that occurs each year that is a multiple of 4 .  However years that are a multiple of 100 but aren't one of 400, are not considered as leap years (E.g: 1900 is not a leap year while 2000 or 1600 are). Therefore, nowadays, it is the same pattern every 400 years.  So let's do the maths on a [0;400[ interval:  On a 400 years period, there is exactly 4 x 25 = 100 years that are a multiple of 4 . But we have to subtract 3 (years multiple of 100 but not of 400) from 100, and we get 100 - 3 = 97 Now we have to multiply 97 by 366 , 97 x 366 = 35502 (365 x (400-97)) = 110 595 Then we just have to add these two numbers in order to know the total number of days in a 400 years period: 110 595 + 35502 = 146 097 To finish, our probability is the number of February 29th in a 400 years period so 97 given that there is 97 leap years divided by the total number of days of our interval: p = 97 / 146097 ≈ 0,0006639424492 Hope this is right and clear.   share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 29 '16 at 15:23       Jonathan Poid   31 1            7      This is a nice analysis of the chance that a randomly chosen date would be February 29th.  I believe most of the discussion in this thread focuses on the fact that this doesn't actually answer questions about chances of births, which do not really behave like random draws from the set of possible days. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 15:28        1      A much easier way is to say that there are 97 leap years per 400 years the way you have already worked out. Calculate the number of days in 400 normal years. 400 * 365 = 146000. Then you need to add the 97 leap days giving 146097. – CJ Dennis  Mar 1 '16 at 7:06        add a comment |         up vote  2  down vote      I believe there are two questions being mixed up here. The one is "What is the probability of any given day being a Feb. 29th?". The second one is (and the one actually asked) "What is the probability of being born on a leap day?"  The approach of simply counting days seems to be misleading as Aksakal is pointing it. Counting days and calculating frequencies of Feb. 29th occuring addresses the question: "What is the probability that any given day is a Feb. 29th?" (Imagine waking up after a coma, no clue what day it is. The probability of it being a Feb. 29th is as pointed out above $p = \frac{97}{146097}\approx 0,00066394$).  Following Aksakal's answer, the probability can just be based on empirical studies of the distribution of births across the days of the year. Different data sets will come to different conclusions (e.g. due to effects of seasonality, long-term trends in birth rates, cultural differences). Aksakal pointed out a study (One comment: to account for the unrepresentative occurence of a leap year in the mentioned data (i.e. $\frac{3}{14}$) compared to the long-term frequency of leap year occurences (i.e. $\frac{97}{400}$) you would have to multiply the frequency of birth on Feb. 29th from the sample by $\frac{97}{400}\cdot\frac{14}{3} = \frac{679}{600} \approx 1.131667$).  Finally, there is a third possible interpretation of the question, which I believe was not intended though: "What is the probability of a specific person being born on a leap day?" Well, for anyone already born that is easy. It is either $0$ or $1$. For anyone not born but already conceived it also can be estimated using empirical studies on the length of pregnancy (see Wikipedia for an overview ). For anyone not conceived yet, see above.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 8:20       mpiktas   27.7k 4 62 121        answered Feb 29 '16 at 16:32       data_enthusiast   34 4              2      Errr, I was ready to vote this up, and then I got to Well, for anyone already born that is easy.

I looked at it and know the outcome (e.g. heads). You are standing next to me, but have not seen the outcome. What is the probability of the coin showing heads (for you, for me, "objectively")? In the example above: for the given (born) person the probability is either 0 or 1 (assuming he knows on which date he is born). If you pick a person at random and you had to guess his birthday, the probability it being a Feb. 29 is than again an empirical question. – data_enthusiast  Mar 3 '16 at 8:53         add a comment |           up vote  1  down vote      I've noticed that most of the answers above work this out by calculating the number of leap days in a particular period. There is a simpler way to get the answer, 100% accurately, by definition:  We use leap years to adjust the regular (365 day) calendar to the mean tropical year (aka mean solar year). The mean tropical year "is the time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth" (Wikipedia). The tropical year varies slightly, but the mean (average) tropical year is ABOUT 365.24667.  If out leap days are correct, then the chance of a randomly selected day being a leap day, is ((tropical year) - (non-leap-year)) / tropical year  Pluging in the approximate number we have, it's (365.24667-365)/365.24667, or 0.24667/365.24667, or 675 per million (0.0675%).  This, however, is for a randomly selected day. I imagine that this is substantially skewed by parents who would rather not have to explain to their kids, "your actual birthday only comes once per 4 years".     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 1 '16 at 21:51       AMADANON Inc.   111 2              2      I don't think this answers the question being asked, because the leap day, Feb. 29, only exists in particular calendar systems. Those calendar systems have only been in use in particular societies during the recent historical eras. For example, this question is not intelligible to someone who reckons time using the Hebrew calendar, which has no "February" at all! Moreover, even if we assume a calendar with a leap day, it still doesn't resolve the indeterminacy surrounding the probability distribution of births to days. – Sycorax  Mar 1 '16 at 22:25            @user777, thats irrelevant.

It's About As Rare As You'd Think By Claire Warner Feb 28 2016 As your Facebook feed has no doubt made you aware, Feb. 29 is just around the corner, and there's one thing on everyone's minds: What are the odds of being born on a leap year? Most people find leaplings, as they're called by local-interest pieces and adoring grandmothers, inexplicably fascinating out of a perception that leap year birthdays are incredibly rare. But popular opinion is rarely 100 percent correct (see: every myth about the menstrual cycle ever). Are your chances of being born on a leap year actually that low? For once, the general public has the right idea, because the odds of a leap year birthday are usually estimated to be one in 1,461 . The statistics behind the number are surprisingly simple: Four years is equal to 1,460 days, and the leap year rounds it up to 1,461. Assuming the odds of being born are the same for every day, your chances of being a leapling turn out to be one in 1,461. That being said, it's not that rare; for example, your odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime are one in 3,000 , and your chances of becoming POTUS are one in 10,000,000. By comparison, being born on a leap year seems like no biggie. However, as the BBC points out, this may oversimplify things; it's well-known that human births vary based on season and location . A 2014 study found that peak birth months occur earlier in the year the further you get from the equator, and the Centers for Disease Control suggest that August is the most popular birth month in America. So in reality, your chances are probably a little less than the statistic cited above, but there's little specific research on the subject. Leap years are used as a way to reconcile the Earth's imperfect orbit with the Gregorian calendar used in most Western countries. Our calendar has 365 days, but the planet actually takes 365.24 days to go around the Sun. The disparity may not seem like much, but the extra time can (and did) build up over the course of centuries unless you account for it. When Julius Caesar came into power, the calendar was something of a mess, as the priesthood hadn't done a great job of keeping up with the convoluted system of the time. Caesar ordered the astronomer Sosigenes to create a new calendar, and he came up with 365-day system that tacked on an extra day every four years. This was later fine-tuned by Pope Gregorious XIII , and voila! You have the Gregorian calendar we still use today. If you were born on a leap year and find yourself so over all the "technically you're still a kid, har har!" jokes, you know who to blame. Thanks, Pope Gregorious XIII.

No longer would I flash a doctored Connecticut license and pose as a haggard 42-year-old Stonington man named Kurt. At the stroke of midnight, I could buy a beer legally. The barkeep slid my license back. “I can’t serve you,” he said. He thought my real ID was fake. Who, after all, has February 29 for their birthday? I protested, but it was no use. “Plus,” he said. “It’s February 28. Come back tomorrow.” Related Story      How Will You Spend Today's 'Leap Second'?  Here’s the thing about birthdays: They happen each year. That’s a birthday’s job: You turn a year older, whether you blow out the candles on the cake or not. Unless you don’t have a birthday. For 187,000 of us in the U.S., that’s what happens three-quarters of the time. We leaplings, as we’re called, have defied 1-in-1,461 odds to have our birthdays fall on February 29. Some would figure that makes us special. It depends on how you look at it. News reports in secondary markets sometimes feature leap-day births or an octogenarian leaper’s 20th. Back in 2008, Martha Stewart hosted 200 leapers on her show. They wore frog-mouth name tags (frogs leap, get it?). “I think you’re all so lucky!” Stewart said, sort of sincerely. She gave them each state-of-the-art digital picture frames. Leapsters keep two sets of ages, annual and quadrennial. We mark time between real birthdays in fourths and halves. Leap-year days serve a purpose, as we know: The extra day tacked onto the end of February every four years accounts for Earth’s spinning around the sun five hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds longer than 365 days. In 46 B.C., Julius Caesar noticed the calendar had fallen behind 90 days and tried to correct the difference, and added days here and there to months on the calendar for one year, adding a leap day every four years thereafter. This still needed tweaking: By 1582, with 11 minutes a year left unadjusted, the calendar had shifted 10 days. The Gregorian reform of the Julian calendar introduced an extra day to make up the difference, with leap years of centuries divisible by four skipped. Whatever. The bottom line is, I turn 12 this year, and I have Pope Gregory XIII and my mother to thank for it. Leaplings have formed clubs over the years, like The Order of 29’ers, set up by a newspaper editor in Pittsburg, Kansas, in the early part of the last century. Since 1988, Anthony, Texas, has championed itself as the Leap Year Capital of the World: In 2012, the town’s three-day celebration included a car show, an ice hockey game, and a golf tournament. At the website of the Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies (“spreading Leap Year day awareness” for 19 years), fellow leapsters and leapettes share tales of woe: children who thought their birthdays were taken away, parents begging and bribing doctors to fudge kids’ birth certificates to February 28 or March 1. The date seems to confound petty bureaucrats and government factotum alike. “When I moved to Oregon and went to get my driver’s license I was told there is no February 29,” Raenell Dawn, the co-founder of the Honor Society, who turns 14 (56) this year, tells me. “The DMV employee actually said to me ‘Are you sure it’s February 29?’ As if I wasn’t sure of my own birth date!” Leapsters fall into two schools. There are those who think it’s a unique quirk, like having double-jointed thumbs or keeping an AOL account. And then there are those who think it’s no big deal. “All I do is spend time with my family and close friends,” Antonio Sabáto, Jr., the actor and former Calvin Klein model (born February 29, 1972), writes to me on Twitter. “Good enough for me.” I haven’t heard back from the rapper and actor Ja Rule (born February 29, 1976) or the motivational speaker Tony Robbins (born February 29, 1960), so I assume being an actual celebrity trumps leapster status. The bottom line is I turn 12 this year, and I have Pope Gregory XIII and my mother to thank for it. I can’t help but think about my life more deeply every four years. Thinking in four-year periods isn’t uncommon—we have summer Olympics and presidential elections on leap years, after all. But, each February 29, I pause to take a life inventory. 16 to 20 marked the time from high school to college. From 36 to 40, I became a father and moved out of New York City. There isn’t much of a Leap Day birthday canon. It’s a good enough birth date for Superman, although who knows what calendar the planet Krypton uses. Leapsters do have children’s books (sample titles: It’s My Birthday ... Finally! and Mommy, Where’s My Birthday? ) and a young adult title ( Leap Day ). Probability theorists have a famous exercise called the “Birthday Problem.” First proposed by the engineer and mathematician Richard von Mises in 1939, the Birthday Problem determines the probability of a match in birth date given any number of people in the same room. (The probability reaches one half at 23 people.) In the original set-up and others, however, Leap Day birthdays are excluded to keep things uniform. Perhaps the most famous leap-day plot device appears in the 1879 Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates of Penzance . Frederic, enslaved to pirates until he turned 21, is convinced to stay until he turns 84 because of his February 29 birthday. “You are the victim of this clumsy arrangement,” goes the lyric for the opera’s leap-year song, “Paradox.” And then there’s Facebook, which bugs users to wish a happy birthday to close friends, family, and the pharma sales rep they sat next to on a plane that one time. Facebook tells the world my birthday falls on February 28 by default. For leapsters who celebrate on March 1 (about half of my leapling brethren are not, like me, strict “Februarians”), this is enough to ruin a birthday. Unless, of course, you just change your birthday to March 1. But the clumsiness of the arrangement is often enough to make me want to throw a fit. Just like a 12-year-old.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Why the GOP Is Making the Midterm Elections All About Impeachment    David Frum      It may be a counterintuitive gambit, but Republicans are betting it will pay off.   To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Trump's Assault on the Rule of Law    David A. Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

The advice column as we know it today started with a deception. In The Athenian Mercury , a London magazine that ran from 1690 to 1697, the Athenian Society—supposedly a group of 30-some experts across many fields—answered anonymous reader questions. They replied to all sorts of queries, as Jessica Weisberg recounts in her new book Asking for a Friend : “Why alcohol killed erections and made people slur, why horse excrement was square, if people born with missing body parts were also missing part of their soul, and if the sun was made of fire.”  In actuality, the Athenian Society was just a handful of men—a publisher named John Dunton, his two brothers-in-law, and a man who “they were 50 percent sure was a doctor,” Weisberg says.    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                   'When Times Get Tough, People Make Tough Choices'    Emily Buder      An emotional film gets up close and personal with a family torn apart by recidivism.

You may assume a 365 day year and that all months have the same probability (which they do not). You solve this the same way that you solve the original Birthday Problem. First, determine the probability that all four people are born in different months: The first person could be born in any of the 12 months: (12/12) The second person could be born in any of the 11 months remaining: (11/12) The third person could be born in any of the 10 remaining months: (10/12) The fourth person could be born in any of the 9 remaining months: (9/12) So the probability that all four are born in different months is:  Therefore the probability that at least 2 of them are born in the same month is   But this is assuming that the probabilities for the months are equal, but in fact, they are not.   Seven months have 31 days,
four have 30 days, and one month has 28 days.   So, let's do this problem right! What is the probability that in a group of 4 people, at least two are born in the same month? You may assume a 365 day year, but this time, let's use the correct probabilities for the months. For each of the seven months containing 31 days, the probability of being born in that month is 31/365. For each of the four months containing 30 days, the probability of being born in that month is 30/365. For February which contains 28 days, the probability of being born in that month is 28/365. Now, we solve this problem in a similar manner to the one above.    We must figure out the probability that all four are born in different months, and then subtract that number from 1 to get the probability that at least two are born in the same month. We must first determine the number of combinations of four DIFFERENT months.    Using 12 C 4 , we get 495 different combinations of 12 months taken 4 at a tiime.   Luckily, we can break this down into nine categories since many of those 495 combinations would have the same probability: JAN-FEB-MAR-APR would have the same probability as JAN-FEB-SEP-DEC because they each have two months with 31 days, 1 month with 30 days, and 1 month with 28 days.  So, here are the nine categories:    Category  1st Month  2nd Month  3rd Month  4th Month  Number of Combinations    #1  31  31  31  31   7 C 4 = 35    #2  30  30  30  30   4 C 4 = 1    #3  31  31  31  30   7 C 3 x 4 = 140    #4  31  31  31  28   7 C 3 x 1 = 35    #5  31  31  30  30   7 C 2 x 4 C 2 = 21 x 6 = 126    #6  31  31  30  28   7 C 2 x 4 x 1 = 21 x 4 x 1 = 84    #7  31  30  30  30  7 x 4 C 3 = 7 x 4 = 28    #8  31  30  30  28  7 x 4 C 2 x 1 = 42    #9  30  30  30  28   4 C 3 x 1 = 4    Total          495    Now the next table shows the probabilty that all four people have different birth months for each of the nine categories:    Category  1st Month  2nd Month  3rd Month  4th Month  Probability that all are different    #1  31  31  31  31  (31/365) 4 = .00005203    #2  30  30  30  30  (30/365) 4 = .00004564    #3  31  31  31  30  (31/365) 3 x 30/365 = .00005036    #4  31  31  31  28  (31/365) 3 x 28/365 = .00004700    #5  31  31  30  30  (31/365) 2 x (30/365) 2 = .00004873    #6  31  31  30  28  (31/365) 2 x 30/365 x 28/365 = .00004548    #7  31  30  30  30  31/365 x (30/365) 3 = .00004716    #8  31  30  30  28  31/365 x (30/365) 2 x 28/365 = .00004014    #9  30  30  30  28  (30/365) 3 x 28/365  = .00004259    Now, we must combine the two tables to obtain the sum of all 495 combinations: Sum =   35 x .00005203   +   
	 1 x .00004564   +   
       140 x .00005036   + 35 x .00004700   +   
       126 x .00004873   +   
	84 x .00004548   + 28 x .00004716   +   
	42 x .00004014   +   
	 4 x .00004259 =      .02369911 However, this only represents the nine  combinations.    We have computed the probabilities for each combination of four months.   
But we have ignored the possibility of the four people having different birth months within the same category. For example: Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in FEB, Carol in MAR, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in FEB, Carol in APR, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in MAR, Carol in FEB, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in MAR, Carol in APR, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in APR, Carol in FEB, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in JAN, Ben in APR, Carol in MAR, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in JAN, Carol in MAR, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in JAN, Carol in APR, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in MAR, Carol in JAN, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in MAR, Carol in APR, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in APR, Carol in MAR, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in FEB, Ben in APR, Carol in JAN, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in JAN, Carol in FEB, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in JAN, Carol in APR, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in FEB, Carol in JAN, and David in APR; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in FEB, Carol in APR, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in APR, Carol in JAN, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in MAR, Ben in APR, Carol in FEB, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in JAN, Carol in FEB, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in JAN, Carol in MAR, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in FEB, Carol in MAR, and David in JAN; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in FEB, Carol in JAN, and David in MAR; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in MAR, Carol in JAN, and David in FEB; or Abe could be born in APR, Ben in MAR, Carol in FEB, and David in JAN; or So, for each category of four months, there are 24 permutations! So, we must multiply our probability sum by 24 to get 24 x .02369911 = .56877864. This means that the probability that four people will have different birth months is .56877864. And finally, the probability that at least two of the four are born in the same month is 1 - .56877864 = .43122136 or 43.12%. What I find interesting is that it is very close to the probability above!    Assuming all months have the same probability, we got 42.71%.
