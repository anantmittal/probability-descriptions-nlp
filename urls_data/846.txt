Posted on September 30, 2013  by  Anna C.     Has your partner, or potential partner, recently informed you that he or she has been diagnosed with genital herpes? After thinking about it, did you decide to continue with the relationship, despite not being infected with the virus that causes genital herpes yourself? Congratulations — the two of you are now a “discordant couple,” which means that one of you has genital herpes and the other doesn’t. While you might have come to the conclusion that acquiring a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection below the belt won’t be the end of the world, you still might want to stay discordant — and do everything you can to minimize chances of virus transmission.    Condoms, medication, and abstinence during outbreaks can reduce risk for herpes transmission.    You can read all about herpes elsewhere on this blog, but here’s a quick rundown: Genital herpes can be caused by one of two strains of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 or HSV-2. While HSV-1 is more commonly associated with cold sores and HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital herpes, either virus can infect the genital area. One estimate states that 1 out of 6 Americans between 14 to 49 years of age has a genital HSV-2 infection. Since genital herpes infections can also be caused by HSV-1 , the number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.  Barring total abstinence from all sexual activity, you won’t be able to protect yourself completely from acquiring HSV — but there are many steps that you and your partner can take to decrease risk. Studies on discordant couples show that viral transmission can be reduced with condoms, antiviral herpes medications, practicing abstinence when symptoms are present, and patient education.  Condoms  Latex condoms protect against most STDs, especially fluid-borne infections like HIV and gonorrhea. But condoms also provide some protection against STDs that are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, including genital herpes. One large study found that condom usage was associated with lower rates of HSV-2 acquisition — the more frequently someone used condoms, the lower the risk. Unsurprisingly, risk was also associated with frequency of sex acts: People having vaginal or anal intercourse more than twice weekly were 77 percent more likely to acquire HSV-2 than people having less sex.  Other studies have reached similar conclusions, such as this study of monogamous, discordant couples, which found that HSV-2-positive men who used condoms were much less likely to transmit the virus to their female partners. Overall, for every 10,000 acts of vaginal or anal intercourse, 8.9 women acquired HSV-2 from their male partners, while 1.5 men acquired HSV-2 from their female partners. HSV-2 transmission also declined over the course of the study, possibly due to a decline in sexual activity between partners as well as counseling to use condoms and avoid sex during outbreaks.  It is difficult to perform good studies on the effect of condoms on disease transmission, because it’s unethical to ask one group of test subjects not to use condoms, and possibly not realistic to expect another group to use condoms consistently and correctly. Therefore, researchers must rely on self-reported data from their subjects and trust that the information they are providing is reliable and that they were using condoms correctly. However, researchers believe that these types of flaws lead to an underestimation of condoms’ effectiveness — so use ’em!  Herpes Medications (Suppressive Therapy)  A partner with genital herpes can consider daily herpes medications, such as acyclovir, which has been found to reduce viral shedding by as much as 94 percent . These medications, which are called “suppressive therapy” when taken daily, have not only been shown to reduce recurring outbreaks in symptomatic sufferers, but also to reduce asymptomatic shedding, offering another avenue for someone with genital herpes to protect his or her partner.  Other herpes medications include valacyclovir, whose efficacy was studied by a team that found a daily 500 mg. dose offered a 48 percent reduction in risk. Not only did this drug reduce the number of herpes outbreaks experienced by the partners with HSV infections, but it reduced risk for their HSV-negative partners, who were more than twice as likely to acquire HSV-2 from partners who were not taking suppressive therapy. For every 1,000 sex acts there were 0.60 cases of male-to-female herpes transmission and 0.23 female-to-male herpes transmissions. Transmission rates were even lower among couples who used condoms.  There are many alternative remedies , such as plant-based preparations or dietary supplements, touted as prevention against herpes outbreaks or transmission, but in general they are not supported by reliable evidence.  Abstinence During Outbreaks  When someone is experiencing symptoms of a genital herpes outbreak — blisters, itching, open or swollen sores, pain in the infected area — he or she is also “shedding virus,” meaning that HSV can be transmitted to others. Someone also might be able to recognize warning signs of an impending outbreak, such as burning, itching, or tingling sensations. When these types of symptoms are present, it is imperative to practice total abstinence until seven days after the sores heal. Because condoms do not cover the entire genital area, they do not provide adequate protection from the virus (condoms should always be used between outbreaks).  A partner with herpes should also avoid touching the sores, as he or she could transfer the virus to another place on the body (such as the facial area), to a contact lens, or to another person. If you have touched a herpes sore, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water immediately afterward.  Unfortunately, most HSV transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding — when there are no outbreaks.  Patient Education  In the 1980s, before the common use of herpes medications like acyclovir, one group of researchers conducted a study on HSV-2-discordant couples. This represented a “best-case scenario” in that the couples were educated on recognizing mild or atypical herpes outbreaks, were counseled to practice abstinence until four days after sores had healed, were taught about condom use, and were highly motivated to avoid HSV-2 transmission. They concluded that the risk of genital HSV transmission was:   10 percent per year, overall  20 percent per year if the partner without genital herpes had not been previously infected with HSV-1 (the virus most commonly associated with cold sores)  16 percent per year in women who already carried HSV-1  32 percent per year in women who did not carry HSV-1   Presumably, HSV transmission rates are higher in the absence of this education, safer sex practice, and desire to mitigate risk. In this study, the factors that made the biggest difference in whether or not someone caught a genital HSV-2 infection from her partner was the consistent use of condoms and spermicide, even during asymptomatic periods.  If you have a genital HSV infection, you can ask a sexual health expert, such as a provider at Planned Parenthood, to educate you on how to be more aware of any cues that the virus is flaring up. Although truly asymptomatic shedding does occur, patients can be made more aware of how to recognize mild or nonspecific symptoms that might signal an infectious period.  Other Strategies  A healthy immune system can help keep viral infections in check. While there are a lot of dietary supplements out there that claim to “boost” immunity , there actually aren’t any magic bullets to ensure a strong immune system. The best things you can do to boost your immunity are to quit smoking , eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and avoid stress.  Some conditions, like an HIV infection or receiving chemotherapy for cancer, can compromise the immune system, which can make it more difficult for your body to control a herpes infection.   Planned Parenthood health centers have condoms, can diagnose and treat herpes, offer patient education on herpes symptoms and transmission, and can help you decide if herpes medications are right for you.

So an even less than 1 in 1,000 chance if one person is on meds?  What’s the big deal then?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 19, 2014 at 11:00 pm  said:    Those numbers are per sex act, so depending on how often a couple has sex, the chances per year would be much higher. The risk might be acceptable to some, unacceptable to others.  Here’s the relevant paragraph from the New England Journal of Medicine:  The median number of sexual contacts per couple during the study was 49 in the valacyclovir group and 46 in the placebo group (range, 0 to 482). The frequency of genital HSV-2 acquisition increased with the reported frequency of sexual activity and was 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of valacyclovir recipients, as compared with 0.68 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of placebo recipients. The respective rates of acquisition among susceptible women were 0.60 and 1.27 per 1000 sexual contacts and, among susceptible men, 0.23 and 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 20, 2014 at 1:03 am  said:    So, take this with a grain of salt, as I haven’t taken my biostats classes yet, but I believe these numbers would translate to a 3.07% chance of a female catching herpes from a male after 52 sex acts (say after a year of having sex once a week on average), while a male would have a 1.19% chance of catching herpes from his female partner after 52 sex acts, assuming the person with herpes was taking valacyclovir.  I used this cheat sheet , where the herpes was represented by 52 lottery tickets. T=1000, W=0.6 or W=0.23, and P=52. Take it with a grain of salt as I’m not a statistician!    Reply ↓           John C. on October 9, 2014 at 7:08 am  said:    Ann,  I believe the cheat sheet you used for your calculations would not  be the proper one to use for this example.  You are also using 52 for sex acts based on once a week.  If you were using this number, your number for W would be much less as .6 and .35 are based on 1000 sex acts.  Based on the numbers from the report, to me at least, its saying that for every 1000 sex acts for women susceptible to HSV-2, .6 women contracted the disease when their partner was on Valtrax while 1.27 women contracted it when their partner was not on Valtrax.  If you put this into a percentage, this means .6/1000 and 1.27/1000 for women and .23/1000 and .35/1000 are the only formulas you would need to use.  If it indeed cuts down viral shedding by up to 94%, that is a major factor in the reduction in transmission.  What the report doesn’t say though, is whether the couples abstained during outbreaks.  Now you add condoms to the mix, and its even lower.  I know people that have been on suppressive therapy for years and have not had any outbreaks during that entire time.  Most people who transmit the disease do not know they have it, therefore they are not taking medication to help control it.  I do believe a cure is on the way for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 as they have now determined what causes Herpes to go into latency in both versions of the disease which makes it impossible to kill.  Once a drug can be created and tested that will bring all herpes cells out of hibernation, it can be killed using the same drugs used for suppressive therapy.  Think of it as one massive outbreak bringing the condition to an end.  Its still a ways off due to lack of funding for clinical trials, but search for Duke University and University of Florida herpes research to learn more about this discovery.

I    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 22, 2015 at 9:31 am  said:    Herpes is spread by skin-to-skin contact. If your girlfriend has an HSV-2 infection in her genital region, it can only be transmitted via contact with her genital region — not by kissing. The herpes virus doesn’t hang out in the blood. (According to Ask Alice , small amounts of virus might enter the bloodstream during the first herpes outbreak. So if your girlfriend has had HSV-2 for a while, you don’t have to worry about even that small possibility.)  According to the Red Cross , people with herpes can donate blood: “Chlamydia, venereal warts (human papilloma virus), or genital herpes are not a cause for deferral if you are feeling healthy and well and meet all other eligibility requirements.”    Reply ↓           karen on July 11, 2015 at 1:41 am  said:    Of the 267 Women 9 got it during the study period.  That suggests in active couple that woman likely have 3% chance of getting it after a sustained time period and sexual encounters.  I’d also suspect the results would be in the double digits if we were talking about a couple where they both didn’t know that one of them has it.  The risk is real over time but not a deal breaker if you think the person is the “one”.  Does suggest not to be too casual and have repeated acts with someone that you don’t deem to have long term relationship potential.  >> Participants A total of 528 monogamous couples discordant for HSV-2 infection, including an HSV-2–susceptible population of 261 men and 267 women.

My partner complained of discomfort after sex with me and when I checked it out a week later I had the virus and a blister on my anus. I felt like my life had ended and was worried because we had broken up and I had sex with a new partner while I was on the last day of my period . After I was diagnosed I was paranoid I had passed the virus to my new partner but I had not. We have been having safe sex whilst I have no symptoms of an outbreak and everything has been gud until now. I was again on my last day of my period and we had unprotected sex in the shower with the water running and within less than 3hours of intercourse my parter started complaining about discomfort. Based on my research it says the virus cannot be passed on via the blood but I am concerned the only time my virus seems to b passing on is during my period.  We are going to the doctor tomorrow and I’m praying that he hasn’t contracted the virus from me .    Reply ↓         Anna C. on December 18, 2015 at 2:19 pm  said:    Herpes can be transmitted even when no symptoms are present, because the virus can be “shed” from your body without symptoms. However, some things can “trigger” the virus, including menstruation . To reduce risk of transmitting the virus to your partner, it’s important to use condoms each and every time, in combination with other risk-reducing strategies like medications (acyclovir).  Good luck, and the doctor should be able to answer your questions. Make sure to write them down first, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting to ask.

Because HSV-2 can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, you can pass the virus to your wife during sex. Condoms will reduce the risk but are limited by how much skin they cover. If she has HSV-1 she has some , but not complete, protection from symptoms of an HSV-2 infection. Has your wife had a blood test for HSV-2? It’s possible she already has it, but never got symptoms. Most people with HSV-1 or HSV-2 don’t get symptoms.    Reply ↓         married couple on December 26, 2015 at 9:56 am  said:    Yes she’s been tested and she is negative.

But probably the best thing to do is to talk to a qualified health care provider for advice on whether you should start using condoms or taking suppressive medication. It also depends on how your wife feels about the possibility of getting HSV-2. Some people are willing to take the risk.

Unfortunately, it’s often impossible to know where an HSV infection came from. It also depends on how you found out about your HSV infection — did you have an outbreak that was confirmed as herpes, or did you have a blood test that showed you had been exposed to HSV? Most people will test positive for HSV-1 on a blood test, but if they don’t have symptoms they can’t know for sure if the infection is located in their facial area, genital area, or both. If you decide to tell your ex-boyfriend, you might find some of these tips helpful.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on February 28, 2016 at 9:00 pm  said:    Suppressive therapy dramatically reduces risk of HSV transmission, and there is less risk of transmission when symptoms are not present, but it is still possible to transmit HSV even when you have no symptoms and are on anti-herpes medications. Someone with an HSV-1 infection in the genitals might not have as severe symptoms if later infected in the genitals with HSV-2, though it is possible to be infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the same part of the body. You and your wife will have to decide what level of risk you’re OK with, and might want to talk to a knowledgeable doctor to get all of your questions answered. Good luck!

You would need to ask your health-care provider to look at your medical records to answer your specific questions, but most STD screening does not include blood tests for herpes, so it’s possible you hadn’t been tested until now. Also, since most people get HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) in childhood, most of us will test positive for it.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on April 1, 2016 at 3:10 pm  said:    Whether to disclose herpes status is a question that a lot of people have when first learning of their diagnosis, especially when they learn how common herpes is despite being stigmatized. People can reduce risk of transmitting the virus to a partner by taking FDA-approved herpes medications such as acyclovir, which decreases the amount of virus that a person can “shed” from their body. While this type of medication can be used along with other risk-reducing methods, like abstinence during outbreaks and condoms or dental dams during other sexual contact, it does not reduce the risk to zero.  However, healthy relationships are built on trust, and talking about HIV/STD status is an important conversation for people to have when first getting together. It might be a difficult conversation, but it’s an important one for all sexually active people to learn to do, regardless of their own HIV/STD status. It is a time to talk about health, boundaries, and what activities you’re into. Disclosing your status can be one part of a larger, and very important, conversation that can help form the foundation of a healthy relationship.

But just because there are no symptoms doesn’t mean you’re not shedding — that can happen with no symptoms at all.  The best way to avoid transmission is to practice abstinence during outbreaks (until a week after sores have healed), to take anti-herpes medications, and to use condoms. Communication is also important. Your guy can decide for himself what risks he is comfortable taking, and he can also get a blood test (if he hasn’t already) to find out if he is already a carrier for either type of herpes. Most people have HSV-1, and HSV-2 is also very common, though the vast majority of people who have it don’t know it, because they never have symptoms.  Please don’t feel disgusting! You are not defined by the viruses in your cells. Everyone has viruses — they are a fact of life — but society chooses to view certain viruses as taboo. It is so unfortunate that so many of us are made to feel shame for our STD status. Shame doesn’t help anyone. Good luck!

I could not find anything online to address the chance of contracting HSV from a known infected person if the *healthy* person decides to take the medication to lower their risk of infection.

It’s a good question, but I’m unaware of any studies on using acyclovir to prevent HSV acquisition in people who don’t have the virus. Using Google, I found this webpage , which says that no research has been performed to answer this question (I’ve never heard of that website and don’t necessarily endorse it). Using PubMed, I wasn’t able to find any article addressing the question either. I did find an article assessing the effectiveness of a different drug (not acyclovir) in protecting HSV-negative people from acquiring the virus — while it had encouraging results, I don’t think this drug has been well-studied as pre-exposure prophylaxis either, but it’s worth a closer look.  The thing is, you would need a doctor to prescribe the acyclovir, and if you’re negative for HSV-2 or don’t have symptoms for HSV-1 (which most people will test positive for), a doctor might not prescribe it — the drawbacks (e.g., cost and side effects) might not be worth the benefits (e.g., avoiding HSV-2 acquisition, which is not a proven benefit). A good thing for sexual partners to do before getting together is to discuss their STD status, and go in for testing together. As I said in my reply to another comment to this post, healthy relationships are built on trust, and having “the talk” about your status is an important conversation to learn how to have. It may be a difficult conversation, but it can serve as an opportunity to talk not just about health, but also about boundaries, likes, dislikes, etc. Good communication is the foundation for healthy relationships, whether they are long-term or short-term.

HSV-1 is usually associated with cold sores, and most people get it when they’re children, but it can easily be spread to the genitals by oral sex. Since HSV-1 is incredibly common (even in people who never get cold sores), the chances are high that your current husband already has HSV-1. If you tell your husband about your diagnosis, you can make sure to share all the important facts with him — the World Health Organization has an excellent webpage about herpes simplex virus.  If the doctor who diagnosed you with HSV-1 can’t answer your questions, you can make an appointment at a Planned Parenthood health center to talk to someone very well-versed in sexual health. Make sure you write all your questions down so you don’t forget them. Good luck!

We’ve been together 4 years just got married . Well 2 months ago I had 4 pimples on my vagina lip. Went to doctor. I have hsv-1. I’ve been taking valacyclovir since then. I have a constant burning in the vagina area. All my doctor says give it time. How much time I’m not myself very sluggish both energy. This burning effects my daily life horribly. I’m not sure which direction to go next.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on July 20, 2016 at 8:20 pm  said:    I’m so sorry you’re going through that! I’m not a doctor, and even if I were I couldn’t give advice over the Internet. The CDC says that herpes outbreaks last 2-4 weeks on average. You can also ask your doctor to test you for other conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Good luck, and I hope you start feeling better very soon!

While HSV-1 usually “lives” in the facial area, it can be transmitted to the genitals, usually via oral sex. You can learn more about HSV-1 here .

Parameters are what we are ultimately seeking to discover in science. If you roll the dice in a specific way from a specific starting position you will always roll a 4. That is better than saying I have a 0.2 percent chance of contacted a disease this week. I know darn well that if there is oozing slime landing in my mouth I am pretty much gonna get infected.  For the love of reality, please give some more details on the virus. I think we all would benefit from more parameters about this virus.I am asking for something more quantitative:  Can you provide average and maximum lifetime of herpes virus in the blood? Can you provide some information on what maximum and minimum temperature will inactive/kill herpes virus and the amount of time required?  I am asking because I am tired of getting information that doesn’t help me. I am represented by parameters not statistics. Parameters represent the reality. Statistics represents everything we can’t fully describe yet but generalizes. In an age when we all want to believe we are exceptional and we all try to consume ourselves into being better than our neighbors can you provide some more scientific details.

Since it is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, condoms are limited by how much skin they can cover. Lambskin condoms are not recommended for STD prevention, as they are porous and can allow viruses through (viruses are smaller than sperm).

I tried them some years back and found them much more sensitive and satisfying than latex. Having said that they are much more fiddling as they do not have a reservoir tip to collect the cum.

Posted on September 30, 2013  by  Anna C.     Has your partner, or potential partner, recently informed you that he or she has been diagnosed with genital herpes? After thinking about it, did you decide to continue with the relationship, despite not being infected with the virus that causes genital herpes yourself? Congratulations — the two of you are now a “discordant couple,” which means that one of you has genital herpes and the other doesn’t. While you might have come to the conclusion that acquiring a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection below the belt won’t be the end of the world, you still might want to stay discordant — and do everything you can to minimize chances of virus transmission.    Condoms, medication, and abstinence during outbreaks can reduce risk for herpes transmission.    You can read all about herpes elsewhere on this blog, but here’s a quick rundown: Genital herpes can be caused by one of two strains of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 or HSV-2. While HSV-1 is more commonly associated with cold sores and HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital herpes, either virus can infect the genital area. One estimate states that 1 out of 6 Americans between 14 to 49 years of age has a genital HSV-2 infection. Since genital herpes infections can also be caused by HSV-1 , the number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.  Barring total abstinence from all sexual activity, you won’t be able to protect yourself completely from acquiring HSV — but there are many steps that you and your partner can take to decrease risk. Studies on discordant couples show that viral transmission can be reduced with condoms, antiviral herpes medications, practicing abstinence when symptoms are present, and patient education.  Condoms  Latex condoms protect against most STDs, especially fluid-borne infections like HIV and gonorrhea. But condoms also provide some protection against STDs that are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, including genital herpes. One large study found that condom usage was associated with lower rates of HSV-2 acquisition — the more frequently someone used condoms, the lower the risk. Unsurprisingly, risk was also associated with frequency of sex acts: People having vaginal or anal intercourse more than twice weekly were 77 percent more likely to acquire HSV-2 than people having less sex.  Other studies have reached similar conclusions, such as this study of monogamous, discordant couples, which found that HSV-2-positive men who used condoms were much less likely to transmit the virus to their female partners. Overall, for every 10,000 acts of vaginal or anal intercourse, 8.9 women acquired HSV-2 from their male partners, while 1.5 men acquired HSV-2 from their female partners. HSV-2 transmission also declined over the course of the study, possibly due to a decline in sexual activity between partners as well as counseling to use condoms and avoid sex during outbreaks.  It is difficult to perform good studies on the effect of condoms on disease transmission, because it’s unethical to ask one group of test subjects not to use condoms, and possibly not realistic to expect another group to use condoms consistently and correctly. Therefore, researchers must rely on self-reported data from their subjects and trust that the information they are providing is reliable and that they were using condoms correctly. However, researchers believe that these types of flaws lead to an underestimation of condoms’ effectiveness — so use ’em!  Herpes Medications (Suppressive Therapy)  A partner with genital herpes can consider daily herpes medications, such as acyclovir, which has been found to reduce viral shedding by as much as 94 percent . These medications, which are called “suppressive therapy” when taken daily, have not only been shown to reduce recurring outbreaks in symptomatic sufferers, but also to reduce asymptomatic shedding, offering another avenue for someone with genital herpes to protect his or her partner.  Other herpes medications include valacyclovir, whose efficacy was studied by a team that found a daily 500 mg. dose offered a 48 percent reduction in risk. Not only did this drug reduce the number of herpes outbreaks experienced by the partners with HSV infections, but it reduced risk for their HSV-negative partners, who were more than twice as likely to acquire HSV-2 from partners who were not taking suppressive therapy. For every 1,000 sex acts there were 0.60 cases of male-to-female herpes transmission and 0.23 female-to-male herpes transmissions. Transmission rates were even lower among couples who used condoms.  There are many alternative remedies , such as plant-based preparations or dietary supplements, touted as prevention against herpes outbreaks or transmission, but in general they are not supported by reliable evidence.  Abstinence During Outbreaks  When someone is experiencing symptoms of a genital herpes outbreak — blisters, itching, open or swollen sores, pain in the infected area — he or she is also “shedding virus,” meaning that HSV can be transmitted to others. Someone also might be able to recognize warning signs of an impending outbreak, such as burning, itching, or tingling sensations. When these types of symptoms are present, it is imperative to practice total abstinence until seven days after the sores heal. Because condoms do not cover the entire genital area, they do not provide adequate protection from the virus (condoms should always be used between outbreaks).  A partner with herpes should also avoid touching the sores, as he or she could transfer the virus to another place on the body (such as the facial area), to a contact lens, or to another person. If you have touched a herpes sore, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water immediately afterward.  Unfortunately, most HSV transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding — when there are no outbreaks.  Patient Education  In the 1980s, before the common use of herpes medications like acyclovir, one group of researchers conducted a study on HSV-2-discordant couples. This represented a “best-case scenario” in that the couples were educated on recognizing mild or atypical herpes outbreaks, were counseled to practice abstinence until four days after sores had healed, were taught about condom use, and were highly motivated to avoid HSV-2 transmission. They concluded that the risk of genital HSV transmission was:   10 percent per year, overall  20 percent per year if the partner without genital herpes had not been previously infected with HSV-1 (the virus most commonly associated with cold sores)  16 percent per year in women who already carried HSV-1  32 percent per year in women who did not carry HSV-1   Presumably, HSV transmission rates are higher in the absence of this education, safer sex practice, and desire to mitigate risk. In this study, the factors that made the biggest difference in whether or not someone caught a genital HSV-2 infection from her partner was the consistent use of condoms and spermicide, even during asymptomatic periods.  If you have a genital HSV infection, you can ask a sexual health expert, such as a provider at Planned Parenthood, to educate you on how to be more aware of any cues that the virus is flaring up. Although truly asymptomatic shedding does occur, patients can be made more aware of how to recognize mild or nonspecific symptoms that might signal an infectious period.  Other Strategies  A healthy immune system can help keep viral infections in check. While there are a lot of dietary supplements out there that claim to “boost” immunity , there actually aren’t any magic bullets to ensure a strong immune system. The best things you can do to boost your immunity are to quit smoking , eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and avoid stress.  Some conditions, like an HIV infection or receiving chemotherapy for cancer, can compromise the immune system, which can make it more difficult for your body to control a herpes infection.   Planned Parenthood health centers have condoms, can diagnose and treat herpes, offer patient education on herpes symptoms and transmission, and can help you decide if herpes medications are right for you.

So an even less than 1 in 1,000 chance if one person is on meds?  What’s the big deal then?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 19, 2014 at 11:00 pm  said:    Those numbers are per sex act, so depending on how often a couple has sex, the chances per year would be much higher. The risk might be acceptable to some, unacceptable to others.  Here’s the relevant paragraph from the New England Journal of Medicine:  The median number of sexual contacts per couple during the study was 49 in the valacyclovir group and 46 in the placebo group (range, 0 to 482). The frequency of genital HSV-2 acquisition increased with the reported frequency of sexual activity and was 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of valacyclovir recipients, as compared with 0.68 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of placebo recipients. The respective rates of acquisition among susceptible women were 0.60 and 1.27 per 1000 sexual contacts and, among susceptible men, 0.23 and 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 20, 2014 at 1:03 am  said:    So, take this with a grain of salt, as I haven’t taken my biostats classes yet, but I believe these numbers would translate to a 3.07% chance of a female catching herpes from a male after 52 sex acts (say after a year of having sex once a week on average), while a male would have a 1.19% chance of catching herpes from his female partner after 52 sex acts, assuming the person with herpes was taking valacyclovir.  I used this cheat sheet , where the herpes was represented by 52 lottery tickets. T=1000, W=0.6 or W=0.23, and P=52. Take it with a grain of salt as I’m not a statistician!    Reply ↓           John C. on October 9, 2014 at 7:08 am  said:    Ann,  I believe the cheat sheet you used for your calculations would not  be the proper one to use for this example.  You are also using 52 for sex acts based on once a week.  If you were using this number, your number for W would be much less as .6 and .35 are based on 1000 sex acts.  Based on the numbers from the report, to me at least, its saying that for every 1000 sex acts for women susceptible to HSV-2, .6 women contracted the disease when their partner was on Valtrax while 1.27 women contracted it when their partner was not on Valtrax.  If you put this into a percentage, this means .6/1000 and 1.27/1000 for women and .23/1000 and .35/1000 are the only formulas you would need to use.  If it indeed cuts down viral shedding by up to 94%, that is a major factor in the reduction in transmission.  What the report doesn’t say though, is whether the couples abstained during outbreaks.  Now you add condoms to the mix, and its even lower.  I know people that have been on suppressive therapy for years and have not had any outbreaks during that entire time.  Most people who transmit the disease do not know they have it, therefore they are not taking medication to help control it.  I do believe a cure is on the way for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 as they have now determined what causes Herpes to go into latency in both versions of the disease which makes it impossible to kill.  Once a drug can be created and tested that will bring all herpes cells out of hibernation, it can be killed using the same drugs used for suppressive therapy.  Think of it as one massive outbreak bringing the condition to an end.  Its still a ways off due to lack of funding for clinical trials, but search for Duke University and University of Florida herpes research to learn more about this discovery.

I    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 22, 2015 at 9:31 am  said:    Herpes is spread by skin-to-skin contact. If your girlfriend has an HSV-2 infection in her genital region, it can only be transmitted via contact with her genital region — not by kissing. The herpes virus doesn’t hang out in the blood. (According to Ask Alice , small amounts of virus might enter the bloodstream during the first herpes outbreak. So if your girlfriend has had HSV-2 for a while, you don’t have to worry about even that small possibility.)  According to the Red Cross , people with herpes can donate blood: “Chlamydia, venereal warts (human papilloma virus), or genital herpes are not a cause for deferral if you are feeling healthy and well and meet all other eligibility requirements.”    Reply ↓           karen on July 11, 2015 at 1:41 am  said:    Of the 267 Women 9 got it during the study period.  That suggests in active couple that woman likely have 3% chance of getting it after a sustained time period and sexual encounters.  I’d also suspect the results would be in the double digits if we were talking about a couple where they both didn’t know that one of them has it.  The risk is real over time but not a deal breaker if you think the person is the “one”.  Does suggest not to be too casual and have repeated acts with someone that you don’t deem to have long term relationship potential.  >> Participants A total of 528 monogamous couples discordant for HSV-2 infection, including an HSV-2–susceptible population of 261 men and 267 women.

My partner complained of discomfort after sex with me and when I checked it out a week later I had the virus and a blister on my anus. I felt like my life had ended and was worried because we had broken up and I had sex with a new partner while I was on the last day of my period . After I was diagnosed I was paranoid I had passed the virus to my new partner but I had not. We have been having safe sex whilst I have no symptoms of an outbreak and everything has been gud until now. I was again on my last day of my period and we had unprotected sex in the shower with the water running and within less than 3hours of intercourse my parter started complaining about discomfort. Based on my research it says the virus cannot be passed on via the blood but I am concerned the only time my virus seems to b passing on is during my period.  We are going to the doctor tomorrow and I’m praying that he hasn’t contracted the virus from me .    Reply ↓         Anna C. on December 18, 2015 at 2:19 pm  said:    Herpes can be transmitted even when no symptoms are present, because the virus can be “shed” from your body without symptoms. However, some things can “trigger” the virus, including menstruation . To reduce risk of transmitting the virus to your partner, it’s important to use condoms each and every time, in combination with other risk-reducing strategies like medications (acyclovir).  Good luck, and the doctor should be able to answer your questions. Make sure to write them down first, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting to ask.

We been married for 22 yrs. now and I found out 2 yrs. ago I hve genital hsv2  from a past relationship like over 20 yrs. ago.  Can she get genital hsv2 from me if we continue to have unprotected sex?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on December 26, 2015 at 9:44 am  said:    Yes. Because HSV-2 can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, you can pass the virus to your wife during sex. Condoms will reduce the risk but are limited by how much skin they cover. If she has HSV-1 she has some , but not complete, protection from symptoms of an HSV-2 infection. Has your wife had a blood test for HSV-2? It’s possible she already has it, but never got symptoms. Most people with HSV-1 or HSV-2 don’t get symptoms.    Reply ↓         married couple on December 26, 2015 at 9:56 am  said:    Yes she’s been tested and she is negative.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on December 26, 2015 at 11:03 am  said:    I don’t remember seeing any studies on whether a person with a long-term asymptomatic HSV-2 infection can stop shedding the virus completely, but I’ll take another look and see if I can find one. But probably the best thing to do is to talk to a qualified health care provider for advice on whether you should start using condoms or taking suppressive medication. It also depends on how your wife feels about the possibility of getting HSV-2. Some people are willing to take the risk.

Unfortunately, it’s often impossible to know where an HSV infection came from. It also depends on how you found out about your HSV infection — did you have an outbreak that was confirmed as herpes, or did you have a blood test that showed you had been exposed to HSV? Most people will test positive for HSV-1 on a blood test, but if they don’t have symptoms they can’t know for sure if the infection is located in their facial area, genital area, or both. If you decide to tell your ex-boyfriend, you might find some of these tips helpful.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on February 28, 2016 at 9:00 pm  said:    Suppressive therapy dramatically reduces risk of HSV transmission, and there is less risk of transmission when symptoms are not present, but it is still possible to transmit HSV even when you have no symptoms and are on anti-herpes medications. Someone with an HSV-1 infection in the genitals might not have as severe symptoms if later infected in the genitals with HSV-2, though it is possible to be infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the same part of the body. You and your wife will have to decide what level of risk you’re OK with, and might want to talk to a knowledgeable doctor to get all of your questions answered. Good luck!

You would need to ask your health-care provider to look at your medical records to answer your specific questions, but most STD screening does not include blood tests for herpes, so it’s possible you hadn’t been tested until now. Also, since most people get HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) in childhood, most of us will test positive for it.    Reply ↓               Jzajza94 on March 29, 2016 at 6:57 pm  said:    Do you feel it’s necessary to disclose HSV to every single sex partner you have moving forward after a diagnosis?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on April 1, 2016 at 3:10 pm  said:    Whether to disclose herpes status is a question that a lot of people have when first learning of their diagnosis, especially when they learn how common herpes is despite being stigmatized. People can reduce risk of transmitting the virus to a partner by taking FDA-approved herpes medications such as acyclovir, which decreases the amount of virus that a person can “shed” from their body. While this type of medication can be used along with other risk-reducing methods, like abstinence during outbreaks and condoms or dental dams during other sexual contact, it does not reduce the risk to zero.  However, healthy relationships are built on trust, and talking about HIV/STD status is an important conversation for people to have when first getting together. It might be a difficult conversation, but it’s an important one for all sexually active people to learn to do, regardless of their own HIV/STD status. It is a time to talk about health, boundaries, and what activities you’re into. Disclosing your status can be one part of a larger, and very important, conversation that can help form the foundation of a healthy relationship.

I felt disgusting with my self when I first found out so I’m asking what should I do?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 3, 2016 at 9:26 pm  said:    Unfortunately, you can’t know when you’re shedding, though sometimes there are signs (e.g., a tingling sensation) that people can recognize. But just because there are no symptoms doesn’t mean you’re not shedding — that can happen with no symptoms at all.  The best way to avoid transmission is to practice abstinence during outbreaks (until a week after sores have healed), to take anti-herpes medications, and to use condoms. Communication is also important. Your guy can decide for himself what risks he is comfortable taking, and he can also get a blood test (if he hasn’t already) to find out if he is already a carrier for either type of herpes. Most people have HSV-1, and HSV-2 is also very common, though the vast majority of people who have it don’t know it, because they never have symptoms.  Please don’t feel disgusting! You are not defined by the viruses in your cells. Everyone has viruses — they are a fact of life — but society chooses to view certain viruses as taboo. It is so unfortunate that so many of us are made to feel shame for our STD status. Shame doesn’t help anyone. Good luck!

Now, I have read a lot on the internet about infected people taking Valtrex as suppressive therapy to reduce the risk of transmission to healthy individuals, but what I would like to know is, what if *I* (HSV-free) choose to take valacyclovir to prevent my chance of getting infected from *her*? I could not find anything online to address the chance of contracting HSV from a known infected person if the *healthy* person decides to take the medication to lower their risk of infection. Any information would be appreciated.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 14, 2016 at 3:49 pm  said:    Hi Jeff! It’s a good question, but I’m unaware of any studies on using acyclovir to prevent HSV acquisition in people who don’t have the virus. Using Google, I found this webpage , which says that no research has been performed to answer this question (I’ve never heard of that website and don’t necessarily endorse it). Using PubMed, I wasn’t able to find any article addressing the question either. I did find an article assessing the effectiveness of a different drug (not acyclovir) in protecting HSV-negative people from acquiring the virus — while it had encouraging results, I don’t think this drug has been well-studied as pre-exposure prophylaxis either, but it’s worth a closer look.  The thing is, you would need a doctor to prescribe the acyclovir, and if you’re negative for HSV-2 or don’t have symptoms for HSV-1 (which most people will test positive for), a doctor might not prescribe it — the drawbacks (e.g., cost and side effects) might not be worth the benefits (e.g., avoiding HSV-2 acquisition, which is not a proven benefit). A good thing for sexual partners to do before getting together is to discuss their STD status, and go in for testing together. As I said in my reply to another comment to this post, healthy relationships are built on trust, and having “the talk” about your status is an important conversation to learn how to have. It may be a difficult conversation, but it can serve as an opportunity to talk not just about health, but also about boundaries, likes, dislikes, etc. Good communication is the foundation for healthy relationships, whether they are long-term or short-term.

But what about when she gives me oral sex, how high are risks? And what about sleeping throughout the night with no clothes on and “spoon” as we typically do? What about foreplay like using my hands and such? And last, what about towels that have her bodily fluids on them? Reading this article and the comments and replays have helped tremendously.

HSV-1 is usually associated with cold sores, and most people get it when they’re children, but it can easily be spread to the genitals by oral sex. Since HSV-1 is incredibly common (even in people who never get cold sores), the chances are high that your current husband already has HSV-1. If you tell your husband about your diagnosis, you can make sure to share all the important facts with him — the World Health Organization has an excellent webpage about herpes simplex virus.  If the doctor who diagnosed you with HSV-1 can’t answer your questions, you can make an appointment at a Planned Parenthood health center to talk to someone very well-versed in sexual health. Make sure you write all your questions down so you don’t forget them. Good luck!

That is better than saying I have a 0.2 percent chance of contacted a disease this week. I know darn well that if there is oozing slime landing in my mouth I am pretty much gonna get infected.  For the love of reality, please give some more details on the virus. I think we all would benefit from more parameters about this virus.I am asking for something more quantitative:  Can you provide average and maximum lifetime of herpes virus in the blood? Can you provide some information on what maximum and minimum temperature will inactive/kill herpes virus and the amount of time required?  I am asking because I am tired of getting information that doesn’t help me. I am represented by parameters not statistics. Parameters represent the reality. Statistics represents everything we can’t fully describe yet but generalizes.

What You Need to Know About Herpes Transmission Medically reviewed by Alana Biggers, MD on  April 13, 2017 — Written by Corey Whelan HSV2 and oral transmission HSV1 and oral transmission Symptoms Prevention Overview  Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) is one of two types of the herpes virus and is rarely transmitted orally. However, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. People with compromised immune systems in particular may be at risk.  HSV2 is a sexually transmitted virus that causes sores and blisters known as herpes lesions. In order to be infected with HSV2, there has to be skin-to-skin contact between an infected person and a partner. HSV2 is not transmitted through semen.  Once HSV2 enters the body, it travels through the nervous system to the spinal nerves, where it typically comes to rest in the sacral ganglia, a cluster of nerve tissue located near the base of the spine. After the initial infection, HSV2 lies dormant in your nerves. When it becomes activated, a process known as viral shedding occurs. Viral shedding is when the virus replicates. Viral shedding may cause a herpes outbreak and symptoms such as herpes lesions. These usually occur in the genitals or rectum. However, it’s also possible for the virus to be activated and for no visible symptoms to occur.  HSV2 can be asymptomatic, which means it causes no apparent symptoms. That’s why it’s important to use protection during sexual activity and to get tested regularly by a doctor if you are sexually active. You can still transmit the virus to a partner even if you don’t have any apparent symptoms.  HSV2 and oral transmission HSV1 and oral
transmission  The other commonly transmitted strain of the herpes simplex virus , HSV1, typically results in oral herpes, or cold sores around the mouth. This form of HSV is more readily transmitted via oral contact, such as kissing, than through genital contact. HSV1 can be transmitted through both giving and receiving oral sex. It can cause both mouth and genital sores. You can also get HSV1 through vaginal and anal intercourse, and through the use of sex toys.  Unlike HSV2, which usually lies dormant between outbreaks at the base of the spine, HSV1’s latency periods are typically spent in nerve endings near the ear. That is why it is more likely to cause oral herpes than genital herpes.  HSV1 and HSV2 are genetically similar to each other. For this reason, having one form of the virus sometimes reduces risk of contracting the other form. This is because your body actively produces antibodies to fight the virus once you have it. However, it is possible to contract both forms.  Symptoms Symptoms to look out
for  HSV1 and HSV2 can both have no symptoms or very mild symptoms that you might not notice. Not having symptoms does not mean you do not have the virus.  If you do have symptoms of HSV1, they may include:  a tingling sensation, itching, or pain, anywhere in the genital area or around the mouth one or more small, white blisters that may become oozy, or bloody one or more small, red bumps or irritated-looking skin  It is important to see a doctor if you suspect you have contracted HSV1 or HSV2. There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications can help reduce the number and severity of your outbreaks.  Prevention How to prevent HSV transmission  HSV2 can often be prevented with some proactive strategies. These include:  Prevention tips Always use a condom during any type of sexual activity. Avoid having sex during herpes outbreaks, but be aware that people with herpes may have no symptoms and still transmit the virus. Maintain a mutually monogamous relationship with an infection-free person. Communicate with your sexual partner or partners if you have HSV, and ask if they have it themselves. Abstaining from all forms of sexual activity or reducing the number of sexual partners you have also reduces risk.

What's a Cold Sore? What Causes a Cold Sore? How Do Cold Sores Spread? How Are Cold Sores Diagnosed and Treated?     Print en español Herpes labial Neal knew something weird was going on. A few days before, his lip started tingling and felt a little numb. He didn't pay much attention to it then, but now there was a certain throbbing something on his lip and it wasn't pretty. At first Neal thought it was a zit because it was red and tender, but then it blistered and opened up. Neal had a cold sore.      Maybe you've heard of a fever blister — a cold sore is the same thing. They're pretty common and lots of people get them. So what exactly are cold sores and what causes them?  What's a Cold Sore?  Cold sores, which are small and somewhat painful blisters that usually show up on or around a person's lips, are caused by herpes simplex virus-1  (HSV-1) . But they don't just show up on the lips. They can sometimes be inside the mouth, on the face, or even inside or on the nose. These places are the most common, but sores can appear anywhere on the body, including the genital area.  Genital herpes isn't typically caused by HSV-1; it's caused by another type of the herpes simplex virus called herpes simplex virus-2  (HSV-2) and is spread by sexual contact. But even though HSV-1 typically causes sores around the mouth and HSV-2 causes genital sores, these viruses can cause sores in either place. What Causes a Cold Sore?  HSV-1 is very common. If you have it, chances are you picked it up when you were a kid — most likely from direct contact with someone who has it or getting kissed by an adult with the virus.  Although a person who has HSV-1 doesn't always have sores, the virus stays in the body and there's no permanent cure.  When someone gets infected with HSV-1, the virus makes its way through the skin and into a group of nerve cells called a ganglion (pronounced: GANG-glee-in). The virus moves in here, takes a long snooze, and every now and then decides to wake up and cause a cold sore. But not everyone who gets the herpes simplex virus develops cold sores. In some people, the virus stays dormant (asleep) permanently.  What causes the virus to "wake up" or reactivate? No one knows for sure. A person doesn't need to have a cold to get a cold sore. Cold sores can be brought on by other infections, fever, stress, sunlight, cold weather, hormone changes in menstruation or pregnancy, tooth extractions, and certain foods and drugs. In a lot of people, the cause is unpredictable.  Here's how a cold sore develops:   The herpes simplex virus-1, which has been lying dormant in the body, reactivates or "wakes up."  The virus travels toward the area that was originally infected (like a person's lip) via the nerve endings.  The area below the skin's surface, where the cold sore is going to appear, starts to tingle, itch, or burn.  A red bump appears in the area about a day or so after the tingling.  The bump becomes a blister.  The blister dries up and a yellow crust appears in its place.  The scab-like yellow crust falls off and leaves behind a pinkish area where it once was.  The herpes simplex virus travels back to the ganglion (nerve cells), where it goes back to "sleep."  How Do Cold Sores Spread?  Cold sores are really  contagious . If you have a cold sore, it's very easy to infect another person with HSV-1. The virus spreads through  direct_contact — through skin contact or contact with oral or genital secretions (like through kissing). Although the virus is most contagious when a sore is present, it can still be passed on even if you can't see a sore. HSV-1 can also be spread by sharing a cup, eating utensils, or lip balm or lipstick with someone who has it.  In addition, if you or your partner gets cold sores on the mouth, the herpes simplex virus-1 can be transmitted during oral sex and cause herpes in the genital area.  Herpes simplex virus-1 also can spread if a person touches the cold sore and then touches a  mucous_membrane or an area of the skin with a cut on it. So it's best to not mess with a cold sore — don't pick, pinch, or squeeze it.  Actually, it's a good idea to not even touch active cold sores. If you do touch an active cold sore, don't touch other parts of your body. Wash your hands as soon as possible.  Be especially careful not to touch your eyes. If HSV-1 gets into the eyes, it can cause a lot of damage. In fact, if you have a cold sore or you're around someone with a cold sore, try to wash your hands often.  Cold sores can be dangerous for people whose immune systems are weakened (such as infants and people who have cancer or HIV/AIDS ) as well as those with eczema . For people with any of these conditions, an infection triggered by a cold sore can even be life threatening.  How Are Cold Sores Diagnosed and Treated?  Cold sores normally go away on their own within 7 to 10 days. Although no medicines can make the infection go away, special prescription medicines and creams can shorten the length of an outbreak and make the cold sore less painful.  If you have a cold sore, it's important to see your doctor if:   you have another health condition that has weakened your immune system  the sores don't heal by themselves within 7 to 10 days  you get cold sores often  you have signs of a bacterial infection, such as fever, pus, or spreading redness   To make yourself more comfortable when you have a cold sore, you can apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel or anything cool to the area. You also can take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Reviewed by: Mary L.

Aikea        December 2013    edited December 2013   in Herpes question(s)      Hi there I'm completely new here. Was feeling really down after being single for the first time while having this. Reading the information on here has made me feel so much more positive about this. So thank you so much everyone. My question is.. If its a 4% chance for a male to catch this with unprotected sex with a herpes + person then what is the percentage of anybody catching it from anyone? And same with using a condom..? Hope that makes sense.       Comments          adrial        December 2013       Hi Aikea! Welcome to the Herpes Opportunity forums! Good to have you. All the percentages of passing herpes are gone over in detail on this handout here: http://bit.ly/h-opp-disclosure-handout The reason there is 2.5x greater chances of females getting herpes than for males is because a vagina has more mucous membrane than a penis. It's easier to transmit herpes when there is easier access to the person's body since herpes is passed from skin-to-skin contact. Mucous membrane is way more permeable to the virus than the skin.

Download your free e-book & handouts now .         Aikea        December 2013       Thanks for the reply Adrial. Sorry I wasn't very clear.. I meant what is the chance of the average person catching herpes in general - say from someone who didn't know they had it etc. I mean like if someone went out and had a one night stand.              adrial        December 2013    edited December 2013       I'm still unclear on your question.  Did you have a one night stand and are worrying that you might have passed herpes to him? What your asking would still carry the same percentages that are on that handout whether it's sex via one night stand or in a relationship or if the person knows they have it or not. I do believe the chances of passing herpes drops considerably when you know your body well because you can avoid sex during herpes outbreaks and when you feel an outbreak might be coming on. But as far as when there isn't an active outbreak, the percentages break down to what's on that handout. Those percentages are aggregates of all the people who have gotten herpes vs all the people who haven't. They're averages. You can't quite say to someone "You're going to get 4% herpes." Either they're going to get herpes or not, but the chances of them getting herpes are much smaller than the chances of them getting herpes, especially when you take basic precautions and are safe and knowledgeable about your prodrome symptoms. Was that more clear?              Aikea        December 2013       Lol ok hmm... What I think I mean is. What is the chance/percentage of anyone catching herpes?               adrial        December 2013    edited December 2013       Have you ever seen the "Who's on first?" sketch? I feel like that's what we're playing now.  To answer your question directly: It depends. The chance of anyone catching herpes depends on if they are a man/woman, whether the person with herpes knows they have herpes or not, whether a condom is used or not, whether suppressive medication is used or not and other factors. The full range in all of that falls between roughly a 1-10% chance of anyone catching herpes at any given time.              WCSDancer2010        December 2013       I would add that a lowered immune system and rough sex (which could cause small tears to form an make it easier for the virus to get in) would put the numbers at the higher end too.

Your right thats us Thanks for answering my questions And answers to questions I didnt ask! By the way I just disclosed and he was really lovely about it.   Whew!              WCSDancer2010        January 2014       YAY Aikea! Another success story               abc123        January 2014       Love the "Who's On First" reference....thanks for asking/answering these questions... And making it funny, too!              Mermaid2349        January 2014       WCSDancer2010, I apologize in advance for hijacking this post, but something you said was exactly what I came to the forum today looking for. Just disclosed, and like Aikea he was great about everything. My question is this, he takes medication that has the side effect of lowering his immune system. And I am wondering what that means in terms of risks to him. I do not want to proceed without doing a bit of research, asking my doctor and the folks on here (who are a lot more knowledgeable than a lot of MD's about the topic) so that he can make an informed choice. I want to keep him safe and herpes free!!! Thanks everyone! Mermaid2349              WCSDancer2010        January 2014       Well, I'm not a doctor so I can't really advise on that. Really, he should talk to HIS doctor about what his risks are. There are many reasons people are on those drugs and some might be more likely to have issues with getting Herpes than others. All we can tell you here is with supressant meds and a condom you can get his risks down to no more than 2% .... and really, I think if you are really, really in tune with your body, perhaps more..... The GOOD thing is that you will have a great excuse to find all kinds of wonderful ways to pleasure each other when you *might* be having an OB that you might not explore otherwise.

I'm new and it has helped a lot. I'm a physicist who now works in infectious disease research (irony!), and one thing I've been reading about is the single-exposure probability calculation present in many posts, most comprehensively here . Though they get to the right answer eventually, I'd like to try my shot at consolidating and simplifying the problem. I think the clear take away from all the analysis is that you can feel comfortable stating the following - anything more or less is over or understating it: "The chances of transmitting genital herpes (HSV2) from a single sex act is much lower than 1%." PLEASE do not state anything more than this. I'll do the calculations below, and they will shock you. But please resist the temptation to cite the actual results that arise from them. I'll go into details at the end. I think the more pedagogical way to do this is to assume the transmission rate is 1% and prove it is wrong ("rejecting the null hypothesis"). This is equivalent to saying we have a 100-sided die, and we roll it twice a week for a year (I assume Friday and Saturday nights!). What are the chances you never roll a 69? The first time you roll it you have a 1 in 100 chance of rolling a 69. The next time you roll it, what are the chances of rolling a 69? You guessed it - 1 in 100. You can say this because each roll is an independent event (a huge assumption that we will discuss later and I believe the reason why health professionals don't share these calculations). During the two rolls, how many total combinations of rolls could we have had? We have 100 possibilities for the first roll and 100 for the second, so the total number of combinations is 100*100 = 10,000. How many of them have at least one 69 in them? Well, if we first roll a 69 then it doesn't matter what we roll next - all one hundred possibilities will give us a case in which there was at least one 69 rolled. Conversely, if we roll a 69 on the second roll, it didn't matter what we rolled in the first roll. Thus the probability is 200/10,000 = 1/50. (Yes, we did double-count the case in which you roll two 69s, so the true probability is 199/10,000). An easier way to do this is to ask, what is the probability of rolling no 69s in two rolls. There is a 99 in 100 chance, per roll, that you will not roll a 69. So the probability of not rolling any 69s in two rolls is the chance of not rolling it in the first roll times the chance of not rolling in the second role, or 99/100 * 99/100 = 9801/10,000 = 0.9801. So you have a 98% chance of not getting a 69 in either of two rolls. How about if you roll this die twice a week for a year? That's 104 times. So the probability of not rolling any 69s in a year is (99/100)^104 = 0.35. What's the probability you will roll at least one 69 in that year? Well, it is 100% minus the probability you will not roll any. 100%-35% = 65%. So let's get back to the H. The calculation I just did states that, if the chances of a single-exposure transmission were 1%, the annual transmission rate would be 65%. But the number from Adrial's handout is 10% for male-to-female transmission with avoidance of outbreaks (Adrial - it is crucial that you change "Unprotected Transmission Rates" to " Annual Unprotected Transmission Rates" in your handout. I'd also add the "sex twice a week" to the "assumes the following" section). So we can do the reverse calculation. What is the per-exposure probability (I'll call this value x ) given the annual transmission rate is 10%? x ^104 = 0.9 This makes x = 0.999. There's a 99.9% chance we won't transmit during a one-night stand. What's the probability of transmission? You guessed it, 1-0.999 = 0.001. There's 0.1% chance of transmitting. Now, we know condoms and suppressive therapy reduces the annual rates, and they are likely multiplicative in their effect. So here are the numbers in that case, using the numbers in Adrial's handout: Male-to-female: Avoid outbreaks only: Annual, 10%, per-exposure, 0.1% Suppressive therapy: 48% reduction. Annual, 5.2%, per-exposure, 0.05% Suppressive therapy + condoms: An additional 30-50% reduction. Annual, 2.6-3.6%, per-exposure 0.03-0.04% Female-to-male: Avoid outbreaks only: Annual, 4%, per-exposure, 0.04% Suppressive therapy: 48% reduction. Annual, 2%, per-exposure, 0.02% Suppressive therapy + condoms: An additional 30-50% reduction. Annual, 1-1.4%, per-exposure 0.01% Why not to cite these exact numbers: Here I assumed every roll is the same. Every die is the same. In the statistics parlance we assumed each roll was "independent and independently distributed." But we know this is not the case with the H. Rough sex may open micro-tears and increase your chances. Your shedding rate varies over time and so each sex act is a roll with a completely different die. People are different and not "independently distributed." So just go with it and tell your partner the chances for tonight are "much less than 1%." Besides, I'm not sure putting on your spectacles, speaking like Urkel, and stating "there is a zero point zero four percent chance I will give you herpes in this encounter" would have the desired effect anyway. (But hey, if that's your thing, run with it. If you are courting a super nerd you may even want to amp it up to "given an aggregate annual transmission rate of 3.6% assuming two sex acts per week, condom use, suppressive therapy, and avoidance of outbreaks, our per-act transmission probability, assuming it is independent and independently distributed, is 3 times 10 to the negative fourth power. The expectation value of the number of sex acts we will have before transmission is 2805.3.") Is this justification to not disclose? There's so much about this on this forum (e.g. here and here ), so I doubt I can add anything new to that subject. I will say it's been 3.5 months since I've had sex - since leaving a lying, cheating girlfriend that I stayed with for 3 months too long because of this stupid disease - and the temptation for me is large. I've had at least three chances to have my "rebound," and this is important because not only do I need to get over the trauma of the H diagnosis, but also the trauma of being so unbelievably deceived, cheated on, and lied to. But have stayed strong and not done it, for I pride myself on being a moral person who struggles to always better myself. Not disclosing would be a betrayal to myself. Another note, I really love @hippyherpy 's thread entitled " The Ladies' Man's Disclosure Success Thread ." It has, at least temporarily, snapped me out of the depression of thinking I'll never have sex again (or at least I have to wait for love to have it again). His work was the real inspiration for me to write this, and to hopefully have my first real disclosure this weekend (besides to the cheating GF who probably had it anyway). We shall see. Well, this was a monster first post. Apologies for the tome - I suppose it was a bit of a catharsis. But thank you all once again, especially Adrial, for creating such a supportive and informative group. If people have questions, concerns, corrections, or comments, I'd love to hear them.       « 1 2 » Comments          janedoe        May 2016    edited May 2016       When I asked the transmission rate per sex act question, I assumed that researchers assume a sex act as a discrete event like you did in your calculations. After some researching I concluded that they just assumed a continious probability distribution (I haven't read journal articles abt H but I am planing to) - that is why they cannot estimate a transmission rate per sex act (I was kind of wrong apparently). Your calculations are to the point (I have a B.S. in Mathematics), and they finally answer my question. Thanks for this. Seeing the calculations made me feel a lot better.       Ace "the Talk"!

WCSDancer2010        May 2016       First off, Thank you @aep001for this ... we actually had a similar reply here from Dr Leone but without all the extended mathematics.. http://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/5255/from-dr-peter-leone-herpes-transmission-risk-per-sex-act-explained  BTW.... this was funny as hell - I kinda wanna make a Meme or a GIF with it...LOL "given an aggregate annual transmission rate of 3.6% assuming two sex acts per week, condom use, suppressive therapy, and avoidance of outbreaks, our per-act transmission probability, assuming it is independent and independently distributed, is 3 times 10 to the negative fourth power. The expectation value of the number of sex acts we will have before transmission is 2805.3." That's HAWT...LOL As for you finding love, you need to read this guy's story... I've watched him through most of his journey and he had quite the ride but what a beautiful ending http://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/3439/tonight-is-my-night Glad to have you aboard               hippyherpy        May 2016    edited May 2016       I'm glad to see my cad ways having some mathematical resonance. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the takeaway here is that compared to Adrial's handout, the risk of giving it to your long term girlfriend over the course of the year is higher (like almost 4% instead of 2%) and the risk of giving it to a one night stand girl is much smaller (.03 % compared to 2%)? It's interesting because the smaller the percent brings disclosure and non-disclosure closer together for the one night stand. At zero percent risk they do come together. What about even longer term than a year. Two years? Three, five, ten, etc.? Does the risk of transmitting to your partner increase as you add more years? Does it bottom out at some point to a percent and not get bigger from there? We talk a lot about the stigma of herpes here, but there is also a stigma of non-disclosure which probably a lot of people are feeling, "I didn't disclose, so therefore I'm going to stay silent" for guilt reasons or fear of litigation. I've had doctors tell me it's ok not to disclose on a one night stand and only if I'm going to get into a relationship. Your math could back that up. The math you present also bolsters disclosure on a one night stand because it really is almost impossible to transmit- to me .03 is getting close to zero. Now all we need is a funny video showing this like the " Adam Ruins Herpes " video. Also some more analogies along the lines of the "car accident" risk but ones that go even further to explain how little the risk is for a one night stand. I deduced a similar number, .02% from the stats I found on line that said it was something like 1/233 chance of passing it.              MMissouri        May 2016        @hippyherpy if you take the disclosure away, where's the challenge in you getting laid? It sounds like it happens pretty frequently even with your H disclosures. It'd just be too easy for you then. Where's the fun in that! LOL              hippyherpy        May 2016       Ha Good question. It's just a different thing now.

Please refer to the link I posted above: http://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/5255/from-dr-peter-leone-herpes-transmission-risk-per-sex-act-explained               Allyb1123        May 2016       My ex never disclosed that he had H to me. We were together for two years before he came to me and said he thinks he might have herpes. When we first started dating I told him I had been raped about 6 months prior and I got tested for everything because of that, about a month before I met him. I had been dating someone prior to the rape and we hooked up a few times before I met my ex, the situation was too much for him. So when I was with my ex for about 4 months he was always bringing up things about std's and said his best friend had H. I remember the feeling I had when he told me his friend had it and that he was out there having sex with women and not disclosing it with them. It was truly disgusting to me. Then here we were building our lives together and bam! He tells me that, at first he says you go get tested and hopefully you don't have it, when I came back positive his whole attitude changed he said I have it to him. Then it was well who knows which one gave it to who. But it always came back to me being the one. He knew my past and played it against me and I took it all and desperately tried to make it up to him for the next 3 years as my despise for him grew stronger. He started treating me like his own personal sex slave and I did it because I was already so beat down in life, I thought he was my only happiness, I was wiling to do whatever to make him happy and stay with me. I finally opened my eyes to everything and I left him. He screamed " you gave me herpes!!" I said how do I know you didn't give it to me mf! And he never mentioned it again. I have since spoken to the man I was with prior to him and he said neither him nor his now wife have anything. The whole point being he eithe cheated on me and got this or he had it the whole time and was on suppression therapy and it took two years for it to come out. I let the herpes be a death sentence, like well I guess I'm stuck with a man who treats me like crap! Now I'm trying to heal from all those things I haven't dealt with and its so hard. Single for the first time in 5 years with a std and baggage!! Winner winner right here! I'm trying to figure it out and I'm glad that there is a place like this I can learn and grow in myself and my knowledge of H. The hardest thing for me is the disclosure part. How do I tell someone!? I have went on some dates with people I have really felt a connection with, and I push them away the min sex is either brought up or I feel like I have to push them away because they don't deserve to have herpes. Is this a normal reaction? How to I help stop that train of thought?              hippyherpy        May 2016        WCSDancer2010 said:  hippyherpy said: I'm glad to see my cad ways having some mathematical resonance.

It's so bad to talk about things? I thought we were all about having open discussions here. I'm interested in why herpes disclosure is so necessary compared to other viruses. It can't hurt to at least be able to discuss this.. if anything this discussion would bolster the disclosure side, as it did for me. It seems as if a few things come into play with disclosure necessity - Risk of transmission - How prevalent the disease is in society - Potential harm of virus for giver and receiver If the risk of transmission drops down to a significant number like .004%, and the prevalence of the virus in society goes up to as much HSV1 oral or HPV, and the potential harm of herpes is actually lower than HPV or some of the other viruses, it does make the question of why we have to disclose worthy of discussion. Also, I don't sugar coat anything. I tell the girls I have herpes. I tell them I take pills and we use condoms and that's not 10% risk. This thread is telling me that the risk is even lower than Adrial's handout. When you start getting into 2% vs. 1% or . 04% that's very low risk in my mind. That's not hiding anything. I don't see how someone could "rip a new asshole" if you've disclosed. Once you've disclosed, you've done your part. For me, I give more info because I think the info actually works in my favor and it's good for people to be educated, but I don't think people are even obligated to anything like that so long as they disclose. I don't believe that a disclosure without providing some info will have a high likelyhood of a "success" The handout says 2% risk of transmission, this thread says less than one percent. I wouldn't go around saying .04% or whatever because I don't think has meaning for most people.              janedoe        May 2016        @hippyherpy The calculations assume iid. which is the same as rolling the same dice everytime. But when you have sex, you are NOT rolling the same dice... You might be shedding virus more on some days, other person might have a tear in his/her genitals, you might have rough sex, your immune system or your partner's immune system might be down when you are having sex... All these possibilities bumps up the transmission rate. So let's say your t.r is 0.04% but tomorrow it might be 1% etc. So, 1% transmission rate is sort of like an upper limit. It might be a good idea to disclose that upper limit.       Ace "the Talk"!

And these are the days that I don't have symptoms?              WCSDancer2010        May 2016        @hippyherpy You said It's interesting because the smaller the percent brings disclosure and non-disclosure closer together for the one night stand. At zero percent risk they do come together. That sounds a lot to me like you are still looking for a reason to not disclose. Again, IMO, if you have the HPV strains for genital warts or cancer, you should disclose ... at least if you are within the 2 yr post "all clear" point when (as *I* understand it) it's safe to consider that it's either gone dormant or disappeared (last I checked there are are still conflicting info on this). As for the other 36 strains - they seem to be harmless AND only we women will know that we have them ... you guys get off the hook on all the HPV except warts as far as knowing what you have (unless you get it in your throat... but that seems to be later in life and they don't seem to think it's important enough to swab you guys for it). So not sure what good it would do to disclose about them. Herpes doesn't affect most people badly... but it DOES affect a small amount of the population and a small number of those people get some pretty rough symptoms. THAT is why we disclose.... for the (my guesstimate) 1% of the population that bets the nerve pain, constant OB's, or other longer term symptoms. We don't know which partner may get symptoms like that. Or if they will get any at all. If you had had a really rough ride with this I bet your POV would be different. But you guys mostly don't get it that bad and the few who do still don't have the kind of folds and areas we have (unless, perhaps, you are uncircumcised) to create the immensely painful sores we women can get. I got a bad OB once when I was planning the last weeks of my wedding. Had to sit on a plane for a few hours. You have NO IDEA of the pain of having a crusted over scab sticking to your underwear and rubbing every time you move. Back then I didn't have access to Valtrex. I was hardly able to move for a week without wanting to cry. THAT is why I'm so adamant about disclosure. I got H on my first sexual experience and in THAT instance, if I had known that guy had H, I probably wouldn't have had sex with him because I really did it to get it over with and see what it was like. Now, knowing what I know now, I would proceed with caution with a partner.... use condoms and such... and for *me*, I can only enjoy sex with someone I see some kind of longer term relationship with...so disclosure would make me really look at whether I saw any kind of long or even short term future with the person. Yes - we are here to discuss things but one thing that we are adamant about is our POV that people should disclose about Herpes. If you want to discuss whether people should disclose about HPV perhaps you should join a forum for that and put in your 10 cents worth..... And I think it's a great thing that people who like the casual sex lifestyle can see that you CAN still find plenty of partners with disclosure. So I appreciate what you bring to us with regards to that discussion. We are not going to change our stance on disclosure here, no matter what stats you come up with. We can't TELL you what to do... but we don't want people to start looking for every excuse to not disclose.... there's a thing called INTEGRITY and we value that here. For that 1% who, like myself, *might* have a tough start with H. hippyherpy said: Let me get this straight, if I have sex 365 days out of the year, don't take meds or use condoms, then about 36 of those days I will give my partner herpes? And these are the days that I don't have symptoms? Again... there's no way to know YOUR shedding rates... and the 10% for women is our RISK .. **Shedding Rates for GHSV2** are 15-30% of the time ... which can be for 1 hr or sustained for days at a time. Rough sex, illness, certain foods, stress, etc can take you from hardly shedding at all to shedding a whole lot for days or weeks at a time. And those are likely the days you don't have symptoms. The CDC says *most people* get HSV from someone who doesn't have symptoms and likely doesn't even know they have H. So to answer your question - it's not that you WILL give your partner H 36 days of the year ... but 15-30% OF THE TIME there's a **higher risk** of you shedding enough to POTENTIALLY pass it to your partner. And again, go read the Dr Leone link ... none of the Dr's that I know who are specialists in the H world support any kind of "per act" stats ... because, as @janedoe said, YOU don't know when you might be shedding heavily asymptomatically ... and stats are only useful in this kind of thing (ie: per act) if you can exactly replicate the data. Because of the variability of the issues of shedding, micro-tears, the other person's immune issues, etc, you CAN'T go on a per-act stat.               hippyherpy        May 2016       Sorry to eat about your outbreak. I definitely do disclose, as you can see in that other thread. Knowing that the risk of transmission is lower than I thought only gives me more confidence in disclosing that I'm less likely to pass it on, not that I wouldn't disclose. Even when I'm buzzed I disclose. It's been baked into my ways at this point.              Katidid        May 2016    edited May 2016       I think often times, we are so inquisitive about the "per sex act" rate of transmission  because we want to keep our partners more safe and have better stats to share with them (and to feel better ourselves about having herpies to begin with)  rather than hoping to not have to disclose. Disclosing, in my opinion,  (thankfully I've only had to do it twice and both were successful) is a very personal choice and it's equally the responsibility of the "other" person to ask....after all, its a shared partership even if for a one night stand. It's all very tricky anyway...... the "other" person may even have it and not know all the while they are asking if you are STD free...or they knowingly  have cold sores and don't give that a second thought!  Really, it's a small wonder it's not 1 out of every 2 people have this.

We were likely "that person" on the other side that should have asked the other person about their status. (I know *I* was! LOL ) Because we are here, discussing this, getting educated, we now know better. So *more* of the burden, IMO, is on us to start the conversation... both because we know AND because we need to know how educated they are and whether THEY are a risk for *us* to get involved with. I briefly dated a guy who just could not get in his head that he couldn't "tell" if a person carried an STD.... he was convinced he would "know" by how they acted, or that he would see/smell something that would tell him they were not "safe". The concept of silent carriers (of HPV/Herpes/Aids/etc) just wouldn't enter his head. We parted before things got too sexual but I wouldn't have got into a relationship with him without him getting a test simply because I felt that odds were he had likely been exposed to at least 1 STD along the way....LOL       Ace "the Talk"! Download your free e-book & handouts now .         janedoe        May 2016        @WCSDancer2010 I was like him before my diagnosis. When I had my first OB, I went to the doctor just to ease my mind and get some medication for the itching... I could never have suspected that those paper cut things were herpes... anyway the second guy that I disclosed to is the same. I think that is because of those google images. They are kind of extreme, it makes you think that if I had those, I would know.              hippyherpy        May 2016       It doesn't have to be "sad" and you don't have to be thankful that you've only had to disclose a couple of times. In my experience, the disclosure is not any where as scary or bad as people might think. I think it has it's own kind of stigma in that sense. The rejections aren't that bad either. If the person doesn't like it, then you move on to someone else. I've had many more successes with disclosure than rejections so far. What I'm saying is that, in general, having herpes isn't a big deal, and neither is disclosing. It's just something you do. It doesn't have to be this big dramatic event.              aep001        May 2016       Sorry for my absence. It has been a wild ride since my last post. I did my first real disclosure on Friday night - third date, girl takes me back to her place and jumps on me. Thanks to @hippyherpy and his ladies man's posts, I assumed it would go fine. I stated things in total confidence, and was in an Uber, crushed, within the hour. I've been pretty depressed ever since. I shall rise again, but not yet. But that is a post for a different forum. I have also been chewed out by an epidemiologist I work with, after a few-hours long conversation that recapitulates much of what is on this thread. It was dangerous for me to do the per-exposure calculation because people will just take that with them (even though I warn them not to), and use it as an excuse to not disclose. On the other hand, I saw it as a chance to try to answer a question everyone was asking, and maybe teach people some probability theory along the way. The take away from this post and my other conversation is, however, that the per-exposure risk can swing drastically. It can be orders of magnitude more or less depending on the person - their diet, immune system, random chance, etc. I thought the "much less than 1%" number balanced those things, and I stand by that, but we should all realize that for any given particular act the odds can be much higher than 1% . So why am I still comfortable telling a girl the chances are much lower than 1% (if I ever have the chance again )? Because life is probabilistic. Whenever you do anything you run the risk of getting hurt, and in our minds we call make the calculation of risk vs. reward. But we should know that those aggregate risks (e.g. 0.04% of transmission, or 0.01% chance of dying in a car crash ) are indeed aggregate. There will be times when the risks are much greater and you just don't know. All we can do is disclose as much of the known risk as we can, hope that others understand the risks and how they are aggregate, and go about living our lives. In this case, by saying the risk is "much less than 1%" (maybe we should take out "much"), we are actually multiplying the aggregate risk by 25. So I think that is safe and cautious to our partners, but would love to hear others' thoughts. I think everyone has struggled with the disclosure question. Goodness knows, all I need is a rebound right now so I can move on instead of thinking about how my cheating ex-GF is doing fine and in a relationship, and that has proven difficult. If I had just not disclosed Friday night my life would be so much better and the girl would probably never have known. But at the end of the day I want to be able to call myself a good person, an honest, open, and moral person. And that oftentimes requires courage, perseverance, and sacrifice. @hippyherpy's successes hearten me that the sacrifice will not be too severe, that one can have his cake (sex) and eat it too (the peace that comes with disclosure). We shall see.              aep001        May 2016        hippyherpy said: What about even longer term than a year. Two years? Three, five, ten, etc.? Does the risk of transmitting to your partner increase as you add more years? Does it bottom out at some point to a percent and not get bigger from there? To answer this let's stay away from the per-act conversation and rely on the more reputable annual numbers. If there is a 10% chance of giving someone herpes in a year, what's the chance of not giving it to them in a year? 90%. In two years what's the chance of not giving it to them? 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. Thus the chances of giving someone herpes in two years is 19%, again assuming sex twice a week. To get geeky, the % transmission is: T = 1-(Q^N) Where Q is the chance of *not* transmitting in a year (1-the annual chance of transmission), and T is the overall chance of transmission in N years. If you were to draw that it would be a curve that is always increasing ("monotonic upward"), but with the slope decreasing ("negative concavity"). It "asymptotically" reaches 100%, that is, there is never a 100% chance of giving your partner herpes, unless you live (and have sex with them) forever. However, there is a 99% chance you will give it to them in 44 years (N = log(1-T)/log(Q), Q=90%). Yes, I am not using the continuous distribution calculations, but I don't think there will be a large difference here. I'm happy to re-work all the numbers if people can tell what distribution they used (Poisson?). So, using the numbers in my original post here are the 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year probabilities: Male-to-female: Avoid outbreaks only: 10%, 19%, 41%, 65% Suppressive therapy: 5%, 10%, 23%, 41% Suppressive therapy + condoms: 3-4%, 5-7%, 12-17%, 23-31% Female-to-male: Avoid outbreaks only: 4%, 8%, 18%, 34% Suppressive therapy: 2%, 4%, 10%, 18% Suppressive therapy + condoms: 1%, 2-3%, 5-7%, 10-13%              Bambina3        May 2016    edited May 2016       I'm just reading this and shaking my head....for me personally, when I leave work, that's where I like to leave my brain (lol) So to chime in and simplify, the transmission risk is so minimal that I sit here and think "why me??" I'm on to read next thread              hippyherpy        May 2016    edited May 2016       Yeah but Bambina I also know people who have been married for over thirty years with HSV2 in one partner, having unprotected sex with the spouse and not transmitting. I'm curious about the stats on thus forum membership. Shouldn't a place like this have many more members if herpes was such a common and debilitating virus? Wouldn't there be many more Ella Dawsons jumping in the herpes as identity politics bandwagon? Or do we represent the worst of the worst with regards to symptoms? I haven't had bad symptoms yet, but some people on here give horror stories.               hippyherpy        May 2016       aep001- you got to just move on to the next opportunity and yes there will be rejection and I had that feeling of "it could be so easy to not disclose" when I've gotten rejected, but my success rate dwarfs my rejection rate. The thing is, if you are talking to a lot of women simultaneously, any kind of rejection that one gives you won't matter at as much because there are others to mingle with. That's the closest I'm getting to math here with the physics genius posting hahah Having herpes will probably force you to improve your game even more, which can only be a good thing for you. Also, to keep things in perspective, there are so many other reasons why people get rejected that I don't consider herpes some special reason. This week I slept with two new sexy girls, and I also had two other previous lovers contact me to hang. All were disclosed to. What I'm saying is that is definitely possible to live the life. You have to make some mental adjustments at first, but it is definitely possible. I can tell you that when I started that thread, I didn't know what to expect. I did have a boost of confidence when I first got diagnosed because I had two of my lovers at the time who I told about it still sleep with me. One of them even went raw. That plus the mindset that I'm not going to let some fucking cold sores get in the way of me doing my thing, and that I saw it as a point of pride to prove to myself and to the world that it can be done- casual sex and disclosure are a very real and possible. I still get rejected but I want you to use and piggy back off my successes to keep your confidence. The self improvement opportunity that herpes presents is tremendous. I suggest everyone on this forum who is interested in having sex and disclosing do what they can to do to present the best possible versions of themselves to potential lovers.               janedoe        May 2016    edited May 2016        @hippyherpy I don't think people here represent the worst case scenerio. I figured so many people are ashamed and afraid abt this. That is why there are people here who don't post. Also, people in long term committed relationships may not have the urge to post here. So, this leaves us with newbies and the people who still trying to figure out this stuff. I'd like to do what Ella did but sadly, my days here are limited and my country is not some place that you can have STI talk openly without getting murdered or else... Maybe later in my life, when I finish my PhD, I will try that.               hippyherpy        May 2016       Wow that is intense. I wish you the best of luck dealing with that situation Jane. You are probably right about the reasons for this place being a smallish community.              MMissouri        May 2016       In regards to our members, you have to remember that most people don't even know they have it. If H were included in the STD panel, I'm sure our numbers would increase in accordance. @aep001 I don't think that people took this post as a way to get out of disclosure. And if they did, odds are they weren't going to disclose to begin with. I'm sorry your date didn't end as you hoped. Hang in there!              WCSDancer2010        May 2016        hippyherpy said: I'm curious about the stats on thus forum membership. Shouldn't a place like this have many more members if herpes was such a common and debilitating virus? Wouldn't there be many more Ella Dawsons jumping in the herpes as identity politics bandwagon? Or do we represent the worst of the worst with regards to symptoms? I haven't had bad symptoms yet, but some people on here give horror stories. 1) 80% of people with H don't know they have it...so why would they be here. 2) Out of the 20% who know they have H, there is a HUGE difference in experiences. Some got diagnosed and have never had an OB. While some have ongoing and unrelenting symptoms. 3) Whether they have no symptoms or "bad" symptoms, HOW they experience things is a very individual thing. So someone with no symptoms may be totally freaked out while someone with "bad" symptoms may just look up "How do I deal with Herpes", get lots of info, and go on a self-led journey. 4) And to be honest, many get some kind of info from their Dr, go home, just accept their fate (in a positive OR negative way) and never look for outside help often because of the misconception that they are alone in this, or they deserved it, or whatever. 5) Last time I talked to @Adrial about this, which was last year I think, we were getting over 50 THOUSAND hits here EVERY MONTH. So we DO reach a LOT of people. The vast majority never post and just lurk. I expect that number is larger now but that's the last number *I* have. 6) We are not the only resource/forum out there. Our style isn't for everyone. So people will go where they find the information and support that works for them. This is the problem with "statistics" ... if you only know one part of the equation, it's easy to make assumptions. We will never know how far our reach is because people may print out the handouts and give them to a friend who just got diagnosed, or to a potential partner and they may never come here. What I DO know is that this site has one of the largest impacts of any info/support group out there. As for more "Ella Dawsons"? Well, there ARE a number of us out there. Most of us are not *quite* as public as she is and she is only that public because she was kinda forced there by a single article that she wrote and that she didn't realize would make such a huge impact on her as well as the H community. It certainly wasn't her intention to go screaming into the limelight that fast               WCSDancer2010        May 2016        @aep001 Here's how I look at your "unsuccessful" disclosure. I think it was a HUGE success. First - you did it. Like most things in life, the first time is the hardest. So - pat yourself on the back. You did it. You stayed in your integrity. It just didn't end the way you wanted it to. Second... I tell women this, but it generally applies to men too: Odds are she was more interested in getting INTO you than getting into YOU. And at 3 dates, disclosure can go either way...the other person isn't invested in you or the relationship. Their hormones are raging but their head may not be in the equation until you disclose at which time if they are not into YOU... if they don't realize what an AMAZING, WONDERFUL potential partner you are, they may well ditch. I'm slowly learning that if I want a "longer term" relationship (ie, not a one night stand) that having sex early is a double edged sword. My desires may be dealt with at the moment, but I have often had sex *knowing* in the back of my mind that odds are this person isn't right for me, or the tables are reversed and *they* suddenly realize they don't see a LTR with me. And then it gets messy and someone gets hurt. Now, I know you are looking to "rebound". I beg you - don't. It's really not fair to do that to a woman when you are still raw and likely going to get in it, then realize you are not ready, and then bolt. Take it from someone who has been the "rebound chick" ... twice. IT SUCKS. They both went from crazy about me to disappearing when their reality kicked their ass and they found themselves still not complete about the past relationship. Fucking someone won't get you over your ex. Promise. You need to work on letting go of how you believe things "should" be. She's moved on... and it's up to you to move on as well. Read the Success Stories on here ... not just HH, but the ones who were like you, who were picking the wrong partners, and who will say they realize now that THEY were PICKING the wrong person before and H has helped them to make better choices so that they find love like they never knew was possible .... I think you need to see the perspectives of people who have found success finding RELATIONSHIPS with H as well... and not just one night stands. (((HUGS)))              hippyherpy        May 2016    edited May 2016       ^Those are good points. I think it's interesting that now we live in a time when there is a lot of emphasis placed on the importance of the experience of hanging out with someone (the "getting into") instead of the "you" part (like what you describe). For many people, relationships are just a thrill ride of sorts, or a form of an entertainment, like watching a movie but being part of it. We live in a time when the things that used to hold relationships together are starting to slide or lose their meaning. That said, it's more of a reason not to take rejections personally. It's not that they are rejecting "you" per se, but the experience that you might be offering them or that they are having. You are just the person who takes the admission ticket at the gate to the rollercoaster- the messenger. If you want to get more riders, then you can change the roller coaster. Herpes is another part of that ride now. That's why I say it's good to maximize any other aspects of who you are, or to at least clean up any loose ends to your presentation that might have been neglected before. Give the other person the clearest picture possible of who you are. Make it as easy as possible for them to get your vibe.

That said, the following article says that a study was done and the results showed that combining daily Valtrex with condoms resulted in a transmission rate of .04% I think this is pretty significant to the disclosure discussion. What this means is that there is probably a greater chance that the girl who's out looking to hook up that night will get herpes from some other guy she might have met at the bar who wasn't aware that he had it (1 out 4 people in my area have it, so that's probably something like 1/8 males, and 80% of them don't know they have it so they wouldn't be on Valtrex) than from someone who is taking Valtrex every day, using condoms for vaginal sex, and avoiding sex during breakouts. Can we really say that it would be reckless not to disclose with a .04 transmission possibility? Wouldn't I actually be doing her a favor by taking her "off the market" that night from potential partners who don't know they have it? Isn't she taking some responsibility from the get go by hooking up with "random" guys. Let's be honest, girls do that a lot these days in our current Tinder/hook-up culture. A few other questions: what about raw sex or blow jobs? Are they totally out of the question or does Valtrex allow them to be in the equation? Also, is it really necessary to see an Infectious Disease specialist after you get diagnosed? I think there is way too much stigma surrounding genital herpes. It's straight up nonsense that oral heroes people don't "have to" disclose but genital HSV people do. There is so much stigma that I'm not sure that disclosure is always the best way to think about moving forward with ones sex life because trying to explain all of this is probably not going to make sense on a one night stand.. consider that so many people are misinformed about the risks of getting it and how "bad" it is (it's not HIV but it gets treated in our culture as a social death sentence regardless). If you are taking the best precautions than why not just go about doing your thing? You aren't hooking up during breakouts. You are taking the daily supressive therapy and using condoms. The people who are out there who are living the hook up lifestyle are probably going to get it sooner or later anyway- I know because I'm one of them. Here is the article I mentioned: http://www.herpes.org/protecting-uninfected-partners/ The 2004 publication of the results of a major scientific study on genital herpes has given new hope to couples in which one partner has herpes and the other does not. In January, 2004, in the New England Journal of Medicine, the results of a multicenter, randomized, clinical trial was published. This landmark study has offered new hope to these “discordant” couples, in which person has genital herpes and the other does not. It is known that partners infected with genital herpes can transmit the infection to an uninfected partner BOTH when symptoms are present (such as redness and blisters) as well as when no symptoms are present (called “asymptomatic shedding”; see the paper on Asymptomatic Shedding at www.herpes.org ). Researchers have shown that viral shedding of herpes virus occurs very often from the genitals of the infected partner even when the infected partner has no symptoms: In some cases over 80% of the time. This means that an infected partner can transmit herpes to the uninfected partner even when no symptoms are present. Wald et al, as well as other authors, have previously described on many occasions that the use of an antiviral compound such as Valtrex or acyclovir promptly decreased the incidence of viral shedding, reducing the shedding by over 80% in many cases. This profound reduction of viral particles was so significant that it made sense to do a research study to see if, indeed, that fewer uninfected partners became infected when the infected partner took antiviral medication regularly. This important study enrolled 1484 discordant couples (again, “discordant” means that one partner had genital herpes and the other did not). The study ran for eight months. With half of the couples the infected partner took Valtrex, and in the other half the infected partner took placebo. The results were vitally important to discordant couples. The research team found that infections developed in the uninfected partner in only 4 of the 743 couples in which the infected partner took Valtrex, whereas 16 of 741 uninfected partners developed the infection when placebo was taken. This was a reduction in risk to the uninfected partners of about 50%, when the statistics were examined. Viral shedding was reduced by about 70% when Valtrex was taken. Close examination of the data indicates another important point. When partners wore condoms during intimate contact WHILE the infected partner took Valtrex every day, then only a single uninfected partner developed genital herpes. This, I think, is a very important take home point. Discordant couples should discuss whether the infected partner should take antiviral therapy. These results give scientific proof that a discordant couple that approaches intimate contact with care can protect the uninfected partner to a very high degree. As the data prove, the results suggest that the chance of the uninfected partner becoming infected is reduced from 8 incidences per 220 couples that nearly always wore condoms but NO Valtrex (about a 4% chance overall) to 1 incidence in 223 couples that nearly always wore condoms and Valtrex WAS taken daily (about a 0.4% chance). So, if the infected partner takes DAILY Valtrex AND the couple “nearly always” uses condoms, as well as avoiding intimate contact if any symptoms are present, the risk of contracting genital herpes during an eight month period goes from about four chances in a hundred all the way down to 4 chances in a thousand. This is a 90% risk reduction from NOT using medication and NOT using condoms. By the way, Valtrex is the drug that was studied in this case. Would other antivirals work, such as Famvir or generic acyclovir? We do know that viral shedding is also reduced for acyclovir. However, the pharmacokinetics of Valtrex show that it generates a four hundred percent higher level of acyclovir in the bloodstream than does generic acyclovir (Valtrex turns INTO acyclovir once it is absorbed). Thus, it is possible that Valtrex is a superior drug and might have greater protection. This study did not look at the other drugs, and chances are that such a study might not be undertaken, given the enormous cost of conducting this research. Finally, REMEMBER!! This study only looked at people who took the medication every single day during the study. There is NO PROOF that taking a pill right before intercourse – or for a few days before intimate contact – offers ANY protection to the uninfected partner at this time. Perhaps such a study will be done one day, but for now, to offer the best chance to the uninfected partner, then the infected partner must take the medication every day. As with all medical information, persons with herpes infections and their partners should make ALL medical decisions together with an informed and caring physician so that the right care is given. CONCLUSION: This important work sends a very clear message. As Corey et al pointed out in a recent edition of Herpes magazine, “the International Herpes Management Forum (IHMF) now recommends that physicians offer suppressive valaciclovir therapy to immunocompetent individuals concerned about transmitting genital herpes to a heterosexual partner, and advises safer sex behaviour, including the use of condoms, to prevent genital herpes transmission.”2 References        « 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 » Comments          hippyherpy        October 2015       Typo- autocorrect wrote "heroes" where I meant to say herpes.

I have a hunch that all the hysteria surrounding herpes was drummed up by pharmaceutical companies trying to make profit selling drugs for herpes. Why would we want to play into their frame by continuing to make a big deal out of this thing via "disclosure" talks? Just so that they can keep their pockets lined with ridiculously high profit margins? Do we really want want to feed the hype machine?              adrial        October 2015    edited October 2015       Hey hippyherpy. (Great name, by the way).  Welcome! Regardless of how low the % is — our handouts http://eepurl.com/b4IPP are based on the popular numbers — from 1-10% depending on medication and barrier methods. And the fact remains, no one gets 1% of herpes. People either get it or they don't. There's always a chance. Your point has been discussed at length on these forums before. Here's a blog I wrote about this double standard you're pointing to: https://herpeslife.com/disclosing-cold-sores-oral-herpes-hsv-1-to-potential-partners-before-kissing/ There is a preference that we have as a community here. That preference is for transparency and openness. Especially when it comes to the kind of intimacy that sex involves (even if it's only sex for one night). And you might be surprised that disclosing might actually make the sex that much hotter! (I know, it kind of blew my mind a bit, too.) Integrity, vulnerability and consideration of another human being is just super hot. And finding this out and practicing it in my life is what had me so inspired to share it and create this whole Herpes Opportunity thing in the first place. So the question becomes: Which feeds the hype and stigma more? Shamelessly talking about sex and the risks (and awesomeness) involved or not talking about anything and jumping straight into bed? I've seen so many examples of having the talk actually brings people CLOSER together because of the shared humanity that it brings (and yes, even one night stands). You might want to check out the e-book here: http://eepurl.com/b4IPP and Lifestyle Guide #3 that's all about how to have the talk that leads to super hot and connected sex. https://herpesopportunity.com/guides.php               2Legit2Quit        October 2015       TOUGH LOVE ALERT @hippyherpy one, I will start off saying, based on what you said on your post,  would it really even make a difference to your conscious if we told you it is wrong to do so, because I have a sneaking suspicion you will be deceitful despite what we tell you? In part of the article you shared the following:  Researchers have shown that viral shedding of herpes virus occurs very often from the genitals of the infected partner even when the infected partner has no symptoms: In some cases over 80% of the time. This means that an infected partner can transmit herpes to the uninfected partner even when no symptoms are present. ^^^^  W information like that, why would you think it is OK to not disclose? The risk is still there and while you feel it's not a big deal, for some it is. First off, the devastation it creates mentally for people is the biggest problem. I watch people come on forums devastated, become severely depressed and some talk of suicide. How selfish is that of you, to decide for someone else whether it is a big deal or not, because getting your rocks off is more important?   Secondly, for some people such as myself, this virus has wrecked havoc on their health. I have multiple autoimmune diseases, which not only made my primary OB horrific, it caused such severe neuropathy on my buttock, back of thighs, w electrical shooting pain to all 22 location's of my sores that I could see, but in my vagina, feet and rectum. I felt like a burn victim and had to go to the ER and be out on anticonvulsants for four months, which had horrific side effects. To this day, over a yr later, I have constant obs, despite taking meds daily, can no longer sit on hard surfaces, as I always have tenderness on my tailbone, back of  thighs and buttock. At my one yr mark, I had 8 back to back obs for two months straight. If someone has cancer, gets cancer and goes through treatment that suppresses their immune system, it will wreck havoc. People w diabetes will have a harder time w it and anyone w autoimmune disease for that matter. So are you going to ask for a run down of their medical history first, to know that it shouldn't be much trouble for them, if they get it? I got this from someone who lied to my face about having it and I find it highly inappropriate for you to treat others health so wrecklessly, as if you are God, to pick and choose that for another.there are plenty on here who have caught herpes, despite using protection and the number for reducing shedding by that study is pretty exaggerated, it is not that high and other studies will contest that number.  This hits home w me, because it was somebody w your same mentality, that has changed my health significantlysignificantly for life. If I even stop taking the meds, I develop severe chronic fatigue. One hr or more of physical activity will deplete me to the point I'm barely functioning, feel sick and will sleep for 15hrs and still need two more days to recover. You don't know if you are going to infect someone who has this type of reaction, not to mention, most seem to have a conscious and believe in disclosure and now you've made their life harder and have to deal w the fear of rejection. It is not OK to play God?  Just remember, KARMA....for me, those low transmission numbers don't apply to me, because I seem to be active the majority of a month and I cannot reassure a partner of low transmission.. That's not fair to do that to someone else . Lastly I will add, it is illegal to knowingly have sex w soneone and not disclose and they can take legal action if they catch it. Not only can they sue you for damages, but cost of medical treatment for the rest of their life for it AND it is public information, so it will be in the paper and people will know your name and face.  This is just my honest opinion, as I'm the face of someone who chose to lie to me.. I could be the girl you infect.              2Legit2Quit        October 2015       Also, in regards to bow many people of of x have it, your numbers are wrong. You say you're basically doing a girl a favor taking her home and saving her from others, but it is 1 in 4 women who have it, it is 1 in 8 men... So, you're not saving her if that's what you think and mentalities such as this, are why HSV is at epidemic proportions.              2Legit2Quit        October 2015       Also, I never have slept around. I went two yrs no sex and had sex once and got this. The assumption that being promiscuous us why you get it, is way off. There are more people I see that aren't promiscuous who get it, than are.       Ace "the Talk"! Download your free e-book & handouts now .         hippyherpy        October 2015       If someone asked me I wouldn't lie about. How many people out there have your condition? How many people out there with your condition would sleep around like one night stand knowing they had your condition and what could happen? I'd have no problem talking about it if they want to bring it up, but why should it be up to me to bring it up? Also compare .04 % transmission to 5-10% of viral shedding for that 1/8 people ( works out to possible 1.25% ) who don't know they have it- it's less of a chance. So, yes if this is the case, they have less of a chance of getting than with some random dude. People are rolling the dice when they go home with a stranger, and they might be rolling the dice even in a monogamous relationship. You missed the point of the article. It said, yes, in some cases 80% of the time viral shedding can occur, but with Valtrex- it reduces the shedding by 80%.. it didn't say that viral shedding will still be there 80% of the time with Valtrex- that the Valtrex works to supress it. I was shocked when I found out I had it, but the truth is I should have gotten it a long time ago. I didn't get the risks before. For me, it's been a few blisters that went away. I take a pill everyday, and I don't have any problems. Some one like yourself, in the situation that you are in, I can understand why you'd be mad if you knew about what you had and the person lied to you anyway. That is a true betrayal. However, that's very different from a situation in which the infected partner is doing the opposite of the reckless thing and taking all the measures to drop transmission rate down .04% which probably lower than the rate you'd expect from sharing a towel or whatever. Not to belittle your situation, but the legality of herpes is very screwed up. How you can prove that a particular person gave it to you, especially if you are sleeping around a lot? Someone with herpes can be taken to court for this and then think they are guilty even when they might not be. Check out this article: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/19/jail-herpes-sexually-transmitted-infection ".. given the widespread incidence of herpes infection in the general population (70% have facial herpes (cold sores) and 10% genital herpes according to the Herpes Viruses Association) and that people may pass on the virus through "asymptomatic shedding", millions of people have been rendered potential criminals, including, presumably, those who pass on cold sores through kissing (how is "sexually transmitted" to be defined?). Third, given that herpes may be dormant for a long time, people may assume that it is a current partner who has transmitted it when in fact it was a previous one (the science is insufficient to establish that this is not the case), and people may ill-advisedly plead guilty when confronted with an allegation."              Anna01        October 2015        @hippyherpy Well I first I want to say "Yay for the advancements in medicine". That is extremely exciting for us and potential partners in the future. The lower the risk of transmission the better right? As far as not disclosing, in my personal opinion, I would like to guide you away from that way of thinking. The truth is....like Adrial said...you perpetuate the stigma. Secrecy, betrayal, hiding things like this makes herpes seem worse than we know it is. You have a very open perspective on the matter. Which I do as well. I KNOW it is not a huge health risk for MOST. Unfortunately it is major for some people like @2Legit2Quit . Because there is a possibility of transmission (no matter how small) we have a responsibility to others and ourselves, to give potential partners a choice. You would be quite shocked at how many people are still interested in casual sex with you. I wouldn't say don't disclose because of the minimal risk but DO disclose because of it. Spread the word. Let people know the statistics. You control yourself. All I can do is hope to guide you in the right direction. I for one think it is extremely important to let someone know prior to sex. It shows you hold no shame in this. Why should you? So my vote is to be open. Be honest. Own your condition. You think that not disclosing is beating the stigma but it is not. It continues the cycle of people associating negative feelings with the infection. Also, are you sure you want people to look at you that way? Do you really want to be known as the guy who knew he had herpes, didn't say anything but gave it to a girl? I am on the receiving end of that guy and let me tell you.....I don't care for him very much. I hope this helps. -Anna              hippyherpy        October 2015       Adriel, you make a good point. How can someone disclose on a one night stand? In my experience so far, the minute someone hears "herpes" they are out the door. It happened to me recently. There's a lot of advice out there for women saying things like "herpes is great because it helps me screen out the guys who aren't into me" etc. There is very little advice for guys who want to have casual sex. Combine super low transmission rate of .04% with the fact that it is a shared responsibility- it takes two people to have sex. If one person doesn't ask, why should I have to bring it up? Here's another example to illustrate my point. Let's say you are a straight man (read: not gay at all and the thought of having sex with another man makes induces nausea) and you meet a girl who seems super attractive. You allow her to give you oral sex, then later you find out that she was really a man dressed as woman. Like Herpes, what's done is done, and you can't erase that memory. Like most cases of herpes, the actual physical problems that would come after the fellatio incident are negligible (or in the case of herpes, very manageable considering that anyone, even people with no money can get health insurance and get a Valtrex prescription now). It can even be argued that the psychological distress that someone who goes through that experience could be similar to the stress caused by the false stigma of herpes. The question is- is the man dressed like a woman really at fault? He/she was just doing his/her thing. The guy on the receiving end of the oral sex didn't ask if it was a man or a woman, so I think it's his responsibility to deal with the consequences and how he feels about the situation. That's how I think about my herpes infection.. it's not life threatening and I had it coming. I don't blame the person who gave it to me. ---- Also, on the topic of disclosure.. For famous people who are known to have it, like Derek Jeter.. does he have to have "the talk" with new girls? It's public knowledge that he has it, so doesn't that count as disclosure. Which makes me think- if there was an online database where people who have herpes could list their names for all the public to see.. would they still have to have "the talk"- since it would be out there in the public, wouldn't it be up to the person that was considering having sex with them to look it up?              hippyherpy        October 2015       Like you, Adriel- you're name is out there. You have a website that tells the world "I have herpes" Why should you have to have "the talk" If some girl is interested in having sex with you, she can you look you up online. A lot of girls do that kind of snooping/stalking when they are considering a man for a relationship beyond a one night stand anyway.              hippyherpy        October 2015       Anna, if I believed I had a significant risk of passing on herpes, I wouldn't have sex with people without disclosing. But that is not the case with a .04% risk of transmission. Also, I know that the power of the stigma because I believed it too before I got herpes. It's not a secret or betrayal if the other person doesn't ask. If they ask, then we can have the talk and I can tell them ".04%" and how billions of dollars have probably been spent trying to keep a false stigma alive so that big pharma can make a lot more money.

I just wanted to see how you'd disclose to me." It was super cute, hilarious and a beautiful moment. And it opened up an amazing conversation that was vulnerable, funny and deeply connecting. And why did I disclose? Because I care about the health and happiness of whoever I'm going to be intimate with. Because I want to treat others how I want to be treated. Because integrity is super important to me. And heck, it's just the decent thing to do. Ask any good woman out there what the sexiest thing is in a man ... One word: INTEGRITY. Try it out. All it takes is practice; and it's a fucking awesome feeling to live life in such deep integrity. And the *side effect* of living life like this is that it happens to be very attractive. To answer all your questions about how to do it, again, check out the links I gave above. It's a powerful perspective shift that can actually make the fact that you have herpes a good thing. It tends to force all these good qualities that you might have been suppressing to the forefront. You might think of it as your — ahem — opportunity. Here's what it comes down to: If sex is just for getting off and there's no need or desire for any human connection, then why not just masturbate or get a blow-up doll?              Sil88        October 2015    edited October 2015       At least you've come here to try and justify it, it shows there's still an element of indecision. Here's what bothers me.. my giver had a one-nighter with a guy. A few months on, I dated her with honest intentions and looking for a relationship - we had the std talk, she had tested clear recently and we used condoms, but I caught it anyway - within a couple of weeks. I didn't have it coming like you say you did, but transmission seems to be much easier shortly after infection. Your crowd aren't likely to wait a year before having the next one night stand are they? If you give it to one girl tomorrow, either she won't know and start her own family tree of + partners, or she'll face the same awkward dilemna and it's up to her to change instead. Honestly, I've had the same thoughts myself.. only with hypothetical ONS. But for me I'd rather be responsible, give my conscience an easy time, and impress serious prospects with some integrity. In my experience, all the girls who have heard "herpes" have all still been interested. (only 3, and I didn't just meet them on a night out, but still..) Btw, if you're from the UK I doubt we even have to discuss about legal implications.              hippyherpy        October 2015       I do want human connection- masturbation isn't the same. You can experience strong connections from casual sex. Also, I'm not looking for a girlfriend. That's a cool story though about her googling you. Girls love to snoop haha .04% is so small that I don't consider that a threat to their health- and if they are like the majority of people who don't have a condition like 2legit, then it's really not a "threat" to their health. That's thing- we keep framing herpes as being a threat to health or as dangerous, but it's generally not. It's cold sores on your genitals. Little kids give HSV to each other all the time. There are so many other things that can cause complications on the level of what 2legit is dealing with, yet they don't have the same stigma as herpes. If it was so dangerous, then they'd put us all in quarantine. They don't even do that for HIV patients. Off topic, but as life threatening as HIV is, it too can be managed to the point where I know of someone who has HIV who gets his levels checked and it often doesn't even show up in the test results because his medicine has knocked it out so much.               chikitta13        October 2015       There's a whole thread on hsv and casual sex. It's worth taking a look at. Generally speaking, the risk is minimal but it's still there. Just some food for thought, what happens if you do transmit the virus. Are you comfortable with that? And comfortable with saying to that person yeah I knew, but telling people was preventing me from getting laid? Idk but really it is about integrity. And that's your decision. For the record, I disclosed in a casual sex situation, and my partner wasn't particularly concerned. As long as protection was used.              chikitta13        October 2015        https://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/70/herpes-disclosure-and-casual-sex#latest        Ace "the Talk"!

Btw, if you're from the UK I doubt we even have to discuss about legal implications. Again, if I thought I was putting someone at a serious risk of getting dangerous disease, I wouldn't be having sex with them in the first place. I'm here because I'm new to this and want to get the real on what herpes is and what it means to have it. I'm betting we are going to see a huge rise in the number of people who have it in the near future. You can thank YOLO and hook-up culture for that. What's up with the UK and legal implications? I read that one article about the guy who went to jail for fourteen months. That's a damn shame and I completely disagree with that verdict. I posted the article earlier in this thread. All it is doing is feeding the wallets of the pharmaceutical companies who not only make money off of herpes medicine, but all the anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication that someone might decide to go on after finding out they got it thanks to the relatively recent (early 1980s) push to stigmatize the virus.              WCSDancer2010        October 2015       I'm heading out the door to work, so I can't give a full response (YET!) but I'm going to give you a bunch of links that will show you that your idea that no one will want to have sex with you if you disclose is waaay off base ... I think your problem is the fear of rejection, so you need to find a "reason" to avoid that possibility. WE have a lot of people who have discussed this on here and have told their "Success Stories" about their Casual Sex hookups And a quick reply to this: hippyherpy said: Again, if I thought I was putting someone at a serious risk of getting dangerous disease, I wouldn't be having sex with them in the first place. It's not that H is a dangerous disease, but not everyone accepts it like you have. You stand a really good chance of eventually passing this to *someone* if you are regular casual sex partaker ... and the EMOTIONAL damage that could be inflicted (thanks to the stupid stigma) usually FAR more painful than the OB's .. AND... not everyone has it as easy as you have... not everyone responds to the meds like you have. Some have had symptoms for over a year WITH the meds.

Risk is risk. No matter how small the percent of transmission is, the risk of giving this to another individual is there. You can make an excuse all you want...the risk is small, I used a condom, she didn't ask so I didn't tell. It isn't about the other person and whether or not they were responsible. It is about you. It is about the type of person you want to be. This isn't a bacteria. It is a virus and it sticks with you for life. So no matter how small it is in your mind, it is still kind of a big deal to a lot of people. So much to the point that we should give people a choice. If a girl doesn't ask you straight out, that doesn't mean you shouldn't tell her. You should tell her for her well being and for your own. Conscience is a powerful thing and you need to be careful with it. Don't do things that might weigh on you later. Also like Adrial said integrity is extremely attractive....extremely! My ex made a huge mistake when he didn't disclose to me. He underestimated my depth. If he would've been honest I wouldn't have dumped him over it. In my experience with disclosure I have told a few guys. One I am dating now and two are friends of mine. When I told them, I was extremely confident, I was honest and I held no shame. They both like me more now. They wonder why we never dated and they find me MORE attractive because of how I am handling this. My honesty lets them know they can trust me. Honesty is a beautiful thing. Honesty doesn't require a question. Someone I plan to be intimate with doesn't need to ask me if I have an STI because I will tell them. I will tell them without shame because there is nothing to be ashamed of. I feel THAT is how we can break the stigma.               hippyherpy        October 2015        WCSDancer2010 said: I'm heading out the door to work, so I can't give a full response (YET!) but I'm going to give you a bunch of links that will show you that your idea that no one will want to have sex with you if you disclose is waaay off base ...

And, what are the odds that if they do get it, that's it's going to be terrible or unmanageable? If the odds were high, then we'd see kids getting quarantined if they had cold sores- it would be treated like the plague. Here's a question for you guys who think this is such a bad disease: Why would you sleep with anyone at all, even if they consented, if you believed this was such a terrible disease? Especially if "not everyone responds to it" as well as I have. Who knows- they might consent to it, and then, if it's really so terrible, end up with some terrible complications do to herpes that they weren't aware was possible.. but wait a second, if that were the case then they'd put herpes up there with HIV legally. They haven't done that though. This is the problem with framing herpes as a terrible thing. In some ways, the hysteria around herpes reminds me of the hysteria surrounding marijuanna in the 1950s especially when we consider the fact that people who have oral herpes- almost the exact same thing and actually with more potential for complications, don't have to disclose. Something doesn't make sense.               hippyherpy        October 2015       It's not that I wouldn't disclose if asked, but I don't yet see the need to bring it up if the other person doesn't ask about it.              2Legit2Quit        October 2015       Well, first off, I was in the process of being tested for autoimmune disease's, I hadn't even made it to the rheumatologist, but was waiting, so I had no idea that my symptoms were autoimmune related, but had a suspicion. Many people walk around w autoimmune diseases and unaware of them and NOBODY knows that it was going to wreck havoc on someone w autoimmune diseases. Herpes is still a poorly misunderstood virus and we are just now learning that other herpes viruses we get as kids, are the cause and/or linked to other autoimmune diseases, including some cancers. Had I wanted to, I could prove the person who gave it to me. You see, w new infections, you will come up negative in blood which I did, but positive in swab... I have evidence to prove he gave it to me and lied, for me, everything I was going through at the moment wasn't worth the mental energy to take legal action. Sometimes that is not worth getting retribution, at least for me it wasn't. . You don't know if he was doing what he could to not transmit it  as I didn't share that part w you. Law doesn't care that you're taking preventive measures as you are, they care you did not discle and passing it knowingly, as you are taking the persons right to choose away. Any articles you find on it, I have already read BTW. :-) May I ask how old you are? Why not give the STD dating sites a shot? My buddy only goes there to meet girls and if he just wants casual sex and you'd be surprised how many are actually game for casual sex. Now you both know what you're dealing w and can feel safer about not catching something else, because these people are likely more aware now of their body now and willing to be more careful, after the lesson of Herp. @adrial this thread and the comments about that married man who was part of a swingers group, got it ans then gave it to his wife, who was not aware of his group activity and she got pregnant around the same time. I feel that thread would be a very informative one for @hippyherpy to read, especially because I believe that guy was trying to break down the statistics and numbers and you had to explain how it doesn't work that way. Hippyherpy, Actually yes, the man/woman is at fault and that is why some have had charges dismissed after they beat up the trans person or even killed them (at least on a lesser charge) such as a crime of passion or what not. Yes, they have even been addressing this issue when it comes to it and should there be legal recourse. That person is absolutely responsible for lying and not disclosing. There are plenty of people out there available who will accept that person's situation.  Nothing good comes from lies Actually, they are finding out more and more, that people have been misdiagnosed and mental disorders they have, are a result of an autoimmune disease, such as thyroid disease. Bipolar disorder and depression has been identified as this as well, so that shows you right there, more people have autoimmune issues or would eventually develop them, than we ever thought before. We are just now  learning these things and we can't make wreckless assumption about people's health status.  I don't feel that you should be assuming these wild assumptions about how serious H is, in regards to health, because yes for most it isn't a huge deal, but how do you know you're not going to infect that one person that it causes meningitis and other major complications and possibly get sick and die. You're playing Russian roulette.   You're playing God... Also, we have some recent conversations going on here w people who are out on their profilesprofiles and Dancer is another one. They all will tell you, that it has made them get even more responses and still be game for sex, even being they are negative. Now doing that, you put the ball in their court, to take the risk of contracting it. Since 1 in 4 women have it, you're likely to have some pretty good prospects numbers wise.              Anna01        October 2015       When I look at 1/223, one thing stands out to me...the number 1. That is 1 person. I would rather give that one person a choice vs keeping this info to myself and they come to me a couple weeks later, crying and sobbing because they are having their first OB. Just saying.              Sil88        October 2015       Can anybody guide me to the research behind the 0.4% figure? I've seen the figures but have a hard time believing them.              Nal        October 2015       I got it during my first ever time, with someone I'd known for 3 months, who tested negative across the board (I saw his results), who didn't know herpes wasn't tested, didn't recognise his incredibly mild symptoms, hence didn't know he had it. And we used condoms throughout. I've been in a lot of physical pain, my holiday was pretty much ruined for the most part and now I'm dealing with this for the rest of my life, not knowing how much pain I'll have to endure in the future. Now I already have much peace with this, because the man who gave it to me genuinely didn't know and is very sorry to do this to me and is having to get tested himself next Monday (I wish I could go with him and hold his and but sadly I can't). If he could've given me a choice on whether he was worth the risk he would've. And I'm 100% sure I would've taken the risk and not regretted it even if I'd been infected. I can live with what happened. Now, if I would have had a one-night-stand with someone who knew they had it and didn't tell me, I'd probably want to kick his balls out of his mouth. With as much pain and panic I've gone through the past 2 weeks, I would not want to risk contaminating someone without giving them the right to decide for themselves whether they want to take that risk or not. I don't know if you realise it, but your magic sex might not be worth it to some and they have the right to make that decision. You don't get to decide for someone else whether your sexy times are worth getting a lifelong skin condition for. Even if it's just a skin condition. It's also just casual sex. I would be livid and bitter and have a much harder time accepting all this than I do now. You really don't get to decide whether someone else thinks your penis is worth the risk. Once you know, it's sort of evil not to disclose, even if the risk is fairly low If I were not given a choice, that's not a person worthy of seeing me naked and I'd feel very betrayed if someone did this to me. I'd instantly regret having slept with that person. It's just really selfish. Even if it's manageable, you have to let people decide whether they want to risk having to manage anything.              hippyherpy        October 2015       Russian Roulette? If you could really compare it to putting a gun to someone's head, then why don't they lock up the millions of children that have cold sores to protect the others that don't? The person has a right to not have sex. If they ask if you have herpes and you say "no" then you are lying. I can see how that would be an illegal thing. If you are transparent, then can you really be to blame? If they don't ask or make an attempt to find out, why should that be your problem? It may sound callous, but logically speaking, it doesn't make sense that all of the responsibility should go on the infected person's shoulders. There is a difference between someone who goes around with a herpes outbreak and doesn't use condoms (or even with a condom) vs. someone who is sleeping with people on outbreaks and making an attempt to reduce the risk as much as possible. Regardless of how bad you think herpes is, the first person is being reckless and the second one is not. Can you really say that someone who is reducing the risk down to .4% is being reckless? Think about it like this- What are the chances that you are walking to the store and a car swerves out of control and hits you? The driver did everything right, but something he had no control over went wrong with the car which caused the crash. Can you call him reckless? If that was the case then everyone who is driving cars is reckless because they could be potentially be putting someone in danger because 10-12% of car accidents are due to mechanical failure.               Nal        October 2015       Having safe sex when you have no STIs is like driving a car. Having safe sex while having an STI that's not entirely prevented by condoms and not telling the other person is like driving a car and texting at the same time, hitting someone and then blaming them for not asking you not to text and drive at the same time. 'How did I know you didn't want me to drive and text, you didn't tell me up front.' Not my fault I hit you with my car.' You don't get to decide whether the risk is low enough or not for someone else. You just don't have that right. Just because you think it's low enough, doesn't mean someone else does too.              hippyherpy        October 2015        Sil88 said: Can anybody guide me to the research behind the 0.4% figure?

RunningScared        April 2014    edited April 2014   in General herpes discussion      Hi everyone, No easy way to say this so I'll just come right out...  I had unprotected sex yesterday with a girl I really like who has had genital herpes for well over 10 years.  She has been on antivirals (aciclovir?) for a long time and said she hasn't had an outbreak in over a year, and has never to her knowledge passed it on to any other partners.  To be honest, and much to her credit, she informed me in advance of her condition, but in a moment of passion I rather stupidly decided to just inspect her visually and then go for it.  I was under the impression that it was only contagious during the OB period, and wasn't aware of asymptomatic shedding until I started researching later. I wound up doing unprotected oral on her for over an hour, and for a few minutes later on we engaged in intercourse, along with plenty of other genital-to-genital contact, all unprotected. Now, the next day, I am of course freaking out and kicking myself for being so reckless...  I spent all night and all day today googling information, which led me here.  So my question is, what are the chances that I've picked up the virus from this event, taking into consideration the length of time she's had it, the constant medication, and long time since her last OB?  Am I fairly safe or am I hosed? I'd like to be in a relationship with her because we click really well and like each other a lot, but really don't want to pick up the disease for the sake of my future love interests, if we don't work out.  Not to mention for my own personal health.  If I stay with her it will be nearly impossible to resist more unprotected sex and oral... am I pretty much guaranteed to pick it up in this case? I'm a crazy jumble of thoughts right now and don't know what to think or do. Thanks in advance for your input.       Comments          alex08        April 2014       While it is contagious at any time, during OB is a definite no no. Everyone is different but my bf and I have been together 7 years and he has never had any symptons. Just keep an eye out. Doctors can also do a blood test if you don't have symptoms. Also just fyi it's still possible to contract it during protected sex. Btw I laughed out loud at 'inspect her visually'!       Ace "the Talk"! Download your free e-book & handouts now .         RunningScared        April 2014    edited April 2014       Haha... yeah I guess that was inadvertently a bit comical.  Shows you my level of ignorance though... ugh. Do you and your BF regularly have unprotected sex and oral?  According to my calculations, if the female-to-male transmission rate is 2% per year of regular sex when an antiviral but no condom is used, that equates to roughly a .0015% chance of transmission per round of sex (assuming sex 2-3 times per week). So "theoretically", there is roughly a .0015% chance that I contracted it last night?   I'm also guessing significantly less than that for the oral portion?  Does that sound accurate?              Sparklepony        April 2014       First, STAY OFF GOOGLE. It will make you crazy. Second, Yes there is a risk you could have had herpes passed along to you. There is ALWAYS a risk. Even with protected sex. However, if she is on suppressive meds then the chance is very small. If she was not experiencing prodome, an outbreak, or shedding then that risk is pretty much non existent. The thing is, she could be have a pending outbreak (prodome) and not know it. Every time it can be different in mildness and symptoms. Herpes is a no rule virus. It seems like you probably would not have gotten it passed to you though. The risk would be extremely small. The best thing you can do is just watch your body closely, and if it still bothers you after you've had time to think rationally again (totally normal to panic right now), get tested in about 3 months. That's all you can do really. You mentioned that the two of you really click and you could see it going somewhere. If so, know that you are always at risk and then decide if you are willing to take that risk.              WCSDancer2010        April 2014        @RunningScared Honey ... BREATHE!!! You are waaay overthinking this. So here is a reality check that @Unhappy1 came up with: Look, there were 135 Space Shuttle flights, two of them blew up. That means there was a 1.5% risk of death for going up in the shuttle. No man in the U.S. would ever say no if NASA gave him a seat on the shuttle, I assure you of that! Now if he's willing to take a 1.5% chance of death for a good ride, don't you think he would take a .015% chance of a skin infection for your ride? [Risk of transmission when no outbreak, on Valtrex, and with condoms is about 1.5% per year (which includes sex 2x week for 52 weeks about 100 occurrences).] Or as I like to point out, If we get in our car, we do certain things to reduce the risk of injury to ourselves and others. We get a license. We wear a seat belt. We buy a car with Airbags... some also have traction control/all-wheel drive/warning systems/etc. We maintain the tires and brakes. We obey traffic signals and laws. And hopefully we don't drive impaired. Now, in spite of all that, we might be in an accident some day. AND, some people take more precautions than others. Some barely pay any mind to any of them. The chance of you dying in a car accident in your lifetime is 2%... but that doesn't keep you from driving, does it? So- it would be useful to know which variety she has HSV1 or 2 ... if it's H1, it doesn't shed as much so with the antivirals your risk will be even lower than the 2% you rightly quoted. So here's the deal - you have a much better chance of getting it from someone else who believes they are H- but who likely hasn't been tested. Sounds like this young lady knows her body and is on the antivirals... as someone who has had this 35 yrs I have not knowingly passed it to anyone since I got divorced (I didn't know I had it and gave it to my ex hubby, but our split was over something completely unrelated). I would get tested now (because I assume you have never been tested for Herpes....and likely not chlamydia either because you have to ASK for both of them with your STD panel). Then if you are still worried, get tested in about 4-5 months if you don't have any symptoms. From now on, or at least until you feel more comfortable with the relationship and how she manages her Herpes, use a condom from now on. And if it doesn't work out, use this as a learning experience to at least use a condom in the early days of a relationship... for your own safety and theirs... until you are sure you want to be exclusive. Then go get tested together... that way you know for sure about your status and theirs (((HUGS)))              RunningScared        April 2014    edited April 2014       Thank you very much for the feedback and advice everyone.  It's going to be one heck of a decision, that's for sure.  We talked about it at length last night and she answered all of my questions.  Apparently she has both HSV-1 and HSV-2, but has only had several cold sores on her mouth over the last 15+ years.  The HSV-2 affects her lower labia. She is taking Acyclovir twice daily, but she said she only takes it once per day when she's single and there is no chance of her having sex.  Is that an acceptable way of taking it? Should *I* take it as a preventative?  Not sure if it will prevent contraction of the disease but might be worth it if it can. She has had several partners that she was with for years at a time, and apparently they never used any protection, nor was she on antivirals at the time, and she did not pass it on to any of them.  Even to this day she says she asks them about it whenever she talks to them and they say they're clean and to stop worrying... lol. Is it possible that some people might be less likely to pass it on than others?  As much as I like her I just don't know if I can justify the risk...  if it's not already too late for me. Thanks again all.              WCSDancer2010        April 2014    edited April 2014        She is taking Acyclovir twice daily, but she said she only takes it once per day when she's single and there is no chance of her having sex. Is that an acceptable way of taking it? Twice a day is the normal prescribed amount and I don't blame her for cutting to one a day when she's not with anyone. I don't take it at all except for OB's when I'm single. Should *I* take it as a preventative? It is not prescribed as a preventative I have also had 2 partners that were 3 yrs, used anti-virals for one because he was like you and was very scared of getting it... didn't for the other because he didn't care. Neither caught it from me. My ex hubby got it from me but I was having a lot of OB's then and thought it was heat rash because back then they tested even less for it then (30 years ago) than they do now I *personally* think you are in a way safer with someone who KNOWS they have it than with most other people who are blissfully ignorant and believe they have been tested when most of them have indeed never been tested for it. So unless you plan to DRASTICALLY change your sexual practices (Date for at LEAST 4 months with no sex and then skip to the STD clinic together to get tested before doing the deed) know that EVERY SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH A NEW PARTNER ASSUMES THE RISK OF AN STD AND/OR PREGNANCY. The CDC says we will ALL likely get HPV at some point in our lives. 80% of the population has Herpes and 80% of them don't know it. . If you are that worried, you better go out and buy the safest car you can find, wear a helmet, and wrap yourself in bubble wrap before you drive next time.... because your risk of just getting INJURED in a car accident is likely higher than you getting HSV from her if she's on the antivirals and you can reduce it even more by using condoms if you are that worried. (Which is not a bad idea if you don't want "Baby-daddy" added to your status on FB... I tell young guys all the time that my daughter got pregnant while on BC.... so if you don't want THAT responsibility, wrap it up!) Bottom line. LIFE.ASSUMES.RISK. Period. If she means enough to you, IMO she's worth the risk. If you are not sure, go back to dating until you are sure. But I believe as a carrier that I'm one hell of a catch and one day, the right guy will realize that... because I have waaay more integrity than most of the women out there both around my sexual life and my personal life. She sounds like she is another who is TRYING to be honest with you. If you choose to move on based on her HSV status, then do so knowing that your next partner may not be as honest and forthcoming (((HUGS)))        Ace "the Talk"!

I've decided to stick it out with this girl and see what happens.  I'm planning to take an HSV-1 & HSV-2 test in a couple weeks to get a baseline and make sure I don't already have anything to begin with.

EmmaLynn__Xx        April 2012    edited September 2013   in Herpes question(s)      Basically a simple question that I can never find an answer to. My doctor told me and a friend who also has H, that its fine to have sex with a partner when herpes symptoms aren't showing. So basically, when they're no blisters, you can't catch herpes? My friend has been having sex with guys when her blisters aren't there, but I've done my research and found out it can be caught..always! Basically my Doctor wasn't helpful, he told me the basics about herpes but never about sex & passing it on. I asked my friend again the other day and she said "Emma when the sores aren't there it's basically like the herpes isn't there!" So I thought wow I can actually have sex after a year of none. But I had to check here first. I even have a leaflet from the doctors about herpes that clearly reads this... "Can I pass the virus to a partner if I have no symptoms?" Here's the answer, "When the virus is dormant/inactive inside the nerve cells it cannot be caught by others, if the virus is on the skin, it may be passed on." This seems crazy, I'm sorry but my friend has the same booklet and she went on this information and has been having casual sex, have I done the right thing by not having sex at all ever since I found out? I wonder if I should have her attitude! She is loving life, lol. Tell me as much as you know about giving it to someone else please, thanks everyone x       « 1 2 3 » Comments          adrial        April 2012    edited September 2013       That's simply not true. Unfortunately the medical community seems to still be either clueless or simply not care enough to learn the basics of herpes. Here is a post on the blog I wrote about asymptomatic viral shedding . If sores aren't present, then there is about a 10% chance of spreading herpes from male to female and a 4% chance of spreading herpes from female to male (less mucous membrane on the penis, more on the vagina) due to viral shedding. And you never know when this viral shedding is occurring; it happens silently. These risks of spreading herpes are lessened by a large degree if you're taking daily suppressive therapy (Valtrex, Acyclovir, etc.), so consider doing that if you're having sex with someone who doesn't have herpes. But regardless of all the protective measures you're taking, new partners should know that you have herpes! Your friend should be telling her partners! She is risking passing herpes to them. (Not to mention, she's risking getting whatever they have if they aren't having an honest STD conversation before doin' the do!)

I have had friends told the same thing when i have encouraged them to get tested - they have been told all sorts of misinformation.  I am finding too that people over 40 who have it a long time are doing the same as your friend, they were told on diagnosis years ago that they won't pass it on without symptoms and of course they believe it - if they have had no symptoms they haven't needed to talk about it and still think that the advice is true.  This is how i caught it...I was as ignorant as my partner even though we had each talked to our doctors. That's why I think this site and others like it are invaluable...we learn from each other and help each other do the right thing by ourselves and those we are intimate with.

It hurts my heart. Holding yourself back because of fear of being rejected is pre-rejecting yourself from everyone, including all those guys who would be totally psyched to be with you — with or without herpes. Have you downloaded the free e-book on disclosure yet? It walks you through the mindset and the actual disclosure itself that happens when you're whole and love who you are. Let yourself heal and re-connect to loving yourself again, yes. But also realize when you're actually holding yourself back from moving on and letting someone love you for you.

It sounds strange but I've lived here all my life and I know everyone, if I was to tell a guy, he would freak and tell everyone. So I need to wait until I'm older to find someone mature enough to know what herpes actually is, and not judge me. If anybody was to find out I had herpes I would not be able to leave my house lol.

I have been pretty open with my family and close friends (both men and women)...yet i am not actively dating anyone close to home.  I have been amazed at the support from those I have told, even my adult kids (that was a tough one but i want them to be informed too and it was hard to hide how sick i kept getting for several months). I have discolsed to dates and it does get easier and the e book will help.  I think different age groups have different difficulties with disclosing and definitely as you get older the more mature and accepting people are.  But its getting it right with yourself first and accepting and loving yourself - that what I have found, I found myself again and then it got easier telling others. I'm sorry you are feeling so lonely...you aren't alone though and I am sending you good thoughts.              healing        April 2012       So that means I have to use condoms for the rest of my sexual life? Just the thought of it makes me want to be celibate forever.  Hi, I am new, I have been recently diagnosed through a routine std test, and I am asymptomatic. Never had an outbreak.              adrial        April 2012       Whoa, whoa, healing! Don't jump to extremes! Slow down, slow down! Yes, you'll have to be more careful than you once were, but think about it: it's just as much a precaution for YOU as it is for them! (You don't want to get anything else, right?) Ah, I remember my pre-herpes days ... I thought I was invincible. The whole "STDs will never happen to me" thing. And then blam, hello herpes! In a way, getting this silly little virus gives me a glimpse into my own lack of invincibility (which is a good thing to get) and allows me to be that much more careful about what I open myself up to (sexually or otherwise). And, aside from that, once you find someone who loves you for you, then herpes really takes a back seat (trust me). I'm in an awesome relationship now with my girlfriend who does NOT have herpes, and we decided together to not wear protection. I take daily suppressive therapy to keep the viral shedding and outbreaks down to minimize her chances of getting it, but when it comes down to it, she loves me for me and herpes doesn't get in the way of that. There are many risks people take in relationships, and herpes is just one of those things. So yes, you'll be more cautious and sexually aware than you once were (again, good thing) AND there's no telling what lies ahead for you as far as a relationship goes. Got it? Don't assume worst-case scenario. Your future hasn't happened yet.               healing        April 2012       Thanks, H_Opp. The thing is, I was always cautious but I guess not enough. I am recently divorced from a 11 year relationship. My ex had oral herpes and frequent outbreaks of it at the beginning of our relationship, which is probably how I unknowingly caught both genital and oral H.  We just assumed I was safe when he didn't have outbreaks. His outbreaks became less when he cleaned up his diet and in the last years of our relationship, he probably  had an outbreak once a year if at all... I have never had an outbreak, so I never had a clue that I was infected. It is hard for me. I just don't know how much more careful I am supposed to be. I don't know how to deal with relationships anymore. I don't want to have a "conversation" with potential partners and risk rejection, so I guess I will have to date people from Herpes dating sites. I work in the natural health field, so I will not be doing the usual suppressive therapy, though I will try to find alternative natural ones. Thank you all for listening. Yes, I am still grieving the loss of what I thought was my sexual purity and cleanliness. I will be okay. I am determine to love myself regardless, and some days are better than others, some nights are better than others.               rinapink76        April 2012       EmmaLynn__Xx ... Hey please Stop all the poohoo talk about u Not ever having Sex. If u are so concern with it. All U need to do Is be safe from now On. Use Condoms and u don't need to mention weather u have it or not. So when u get pressured to asking not to used it ... U may say .. 'I'm not ready for a child" "I'm in need for safety always" " No sex without it and that My final answer". Love U and Respect urself like no one will.

Even if condoms are involved there's still a chance of passing herpes. Nothing is ever 100%. Hell, even if suppressive therapy, condoms and a biohazard suit are involved, you're still sharing something. At least have the decency of sharing that you have herpes, too. This also brings up a whole other subject: If the other person doesn't ask if you have anything, are you obliged to be proactive and tell them that you do? My take on this is that if you're going to be intimate enough to have sex, you should be intimate enough to open up a sex conversation, too. AND ... who knows what sort of fun gifts they might have to give you? You're protecting yourself, too! What if the condom breaks and you end up with something more than a silly little herpes virus? Having the sex talk protects partners both ways. And it's just the cool thing to do.               EmmaLynn__Xx        April 2012    edited April 2012       I have come to realise that I cannot have sex until I wish to settle down with a long term partner, and this will not be until I am a lot older than 19. I met someone that I really like and I have been meeting him for months now, but I had to let him go. I am finding this really hard. Everyone has always said how me and him should be together and I am so upset, I cannot give him what someone else could give him so I've let him go. I think it was the right thing to do because at 19, he wouldn't of agreed to risk catching it from me and I dont think I have the right to put him in this horrible place that I am in. He has now found someone else and I wish I could be her so much. She is so lucky. I know I will forget him and move on, of course I will, but how many more people am I going to have to let slip away? I do concentrate on me now, I enjoy myself a lot and can do whatever I like whenever I like, but when you aren't looking for someone they just keep coming. I want my old life back so much!              rinapink76        May 2012    edited May 2012       the_H_Opp .. Yeah U are very right. its hard, plenty of ppl are not honest and how to know if they are being honest with me too, so I always carry female condoms, which I like more but of course if I get intimate with someone I do say so, Most guys they don't even care. That worries me a lot too. I have never had a condom break on me or the guy I had sex with. I understand you, I know nothing is 100% safe !!              Whatsthescoop        August 2012    edited August 2012       In need of some questions answered, A man I care dearly for has HSV1, and says he has it genitally, but has never had an outbreak down there--only oral cold sores. We've been dating since February, but only recently started having sex-- When telling me of his herpes (after our 3rd date) he explained that generally he gets one cold sore a year--however, he's now had an outbreak in July, and again this month I went to my OBGYN and am still testing negative for the virus--so I was finding your messages very informative--I didn't know of these Suppressives. They sound like a good idea for him, less outbreaks, and for me, slightly more protection from contracting the virus. When he has an active outbreak, as he does right now, kissing my forehead, neck, back, etc is alright, right? I'm under the impression that he would need to kiss my lips or other more intimate place for me to catch the virus!?!?!

Yes, if he takes suppressive therapy, you will decrease the chances by 50-80%, some studies say. Always a good thing to get on suppressive therapy to protect the partner who doesn't have herpes. Also, you're right that it's very unlikely he will pass herpes to you by kissing other parts of your body, but if he's having an outbreak, I would suggest he doesn't just in case. Herpes has been known to produce outbreaks in random places, so if there were a break in your skin, whether it's a cut or a popped zit, the virus could have an opening to the body. Better to play it safe and hold off on that until the virus is cleared up. And by the way, you can make it a game instead of an "ew gross" experience. Does that make sense? Playfully make the outbreak mean that he can touch you however he wants, but not with his mouth. My girlfriend and I play that game and it's pretty sexy. Switch the perspective and make it fun. Hold off on kissing anywhere until after the episode has passed, then reintroduce kissing ... the sparks will fly.        Ace "the Talk"!

My doctor and other counsellors have told me this.  I have never given it to anyone in 18 years.   Voila              hforumap        September 2012       Oh, only tell someone if you think the person really cares about you too.              hforumap        September 2012       If they care, and you let them know to make sure they are wearing a condomn and no outbreaks, the risk is very low.              adrial        September 2012    edited November 2013       hforumap - You should be telling ALL sexual partners that you have herpes and be clear on what the risks actually are (which are small with awareness and precautions). And yes, of course the more precautions, the less risk. AND taking suppressive therapy lessens (by anywhere from 50-80%, depending on what study you read) the risk that's still there with condoms and avoiding sex during an outbreak. And another thing to consider is what if where your outbreaks happen isn't covered by the condom? Even when an outbreak isn't present, there's still a risk due to asymptomatic viral shedding. All of these considerations are there so you can lessen the risk and then let it all go ... so you can enjoy yourself.               hforumap        September 2012    edited September 2012       Hi Adrial, I was told by a counsellor in a sex clinic that people can put a bandade on the area where outbreaks usually happen which prevents skin to skin contact helps.              lively        September 2012       Interesting  getting  down to  the nitty  gritty  on  this  page.  Just so  you  all  know, I have never  had  H  internally, ever.  This  suggests  to  me that  I  got  it from  a  guy  who  was wearing  a condom.  Pay  attention  people!  there's  plenty  external (for  a  woman)  or  non-penis (for  a  man)  skin  that  contacts  repeatedly under  pressure  when  you  are  engaged in  sex.  Definitely  not  100%  on  condoms and no  symptoms.  On  another  angle, I'm  surprised  so  many here  are  still  using  the term "outbreak"  for  symptoms.  Language  is  powerful,  could  choose  a gentler  word,  even  'symptoms' is  kinder  to your  body  and  selfimage  than  'outbreak'.  My  favourite  is  still  "episode".              lively        September 2012       When  I think  of  having  sex  with  a  bandaid  on  my  labia  I  laugh  out  loud!!  you  don't  really  think  it  would  stay  in  place  with  all  that  sliding and slipping do  you?              adrial        September 2012    edited November 2013       lively! I love it! Yes, I like episode. I also like occurrence. Anything other than a word that sounds like some dangerous criminal is trying to get out of a prison otherwise known as my body. (And FYI, why I tend to use the cliché terms is so people who are searching for those terms online can stumble upon this site. That's my excuse. AND thanks for the reminder.) And I GUFFAWED on that last one. Bandaid on my labia! That's a new rock band name waiting to happen! And seriously, a band-aid doesn't protect your partner from passing herpes. It wouldn't hurt, but definitely don't expect it to be the protection you need to keep your partner safe. Just avoid sex completely when there are any signs or symptoms of a herpes outbreak.              VirgoGirl        September 2012       labia band-aid! good one! definately sounds like a band name too! speaking of suppressives..it is something I would definately consider if I was going to be in an intimate relationship with someone, but what I am concerned about is the cost?

And I don't have regular insurance (one of the perks of being self-employed.) Valtrex is super expensive, especially if you don't have a nice insurance plan. But everything I've read and heard says that Acyclovir and Valtrex are practically the same, you just have to take Acyclovir 2x/day instead of taking Valtrex once (V is time-released). Anyway, point is, herpes medication is super cheap! (I just wonder about the long-term health effects of taking a daily medication like that. I have my eye more on that than the cost.)              boot_fist        September 2012       To VirgoGirl, I go to Walgreens for mine, and generic Valtrex (Valacyclovir) is $10 per refill, that I'm aware. I'm not in a relationship and kind of want to see how my body reacts before I decide to go on daily suppressive therapy, but if you can ger generics of anything they're usually way cheaper. I think brand-name Valtrex is $45 through Walgreens, which is ridiculous.              lively        September 2012       Hi  Adrial,  oh  of  course,  SEO,  help  all  those people  who  have  H  acting  like a  dangerous  criminal  find  a  haven  with  you  and  your  community,  like  we  all  have .

I'm supposed to take it twice a day 400mg but I only take it once a day.  I definitely need to supress. I paid 15.00 for a 90 day supply.  Valtrex is one of the most expensive meds out there.  Always ask if you do have insurance if you can do a 90 day supply its always cheaper than a one month. If I were to pay a one month supply its 7 dollars (generic) so, Its cheaper for me to get a 90 day supply but you have to ask your Dr. to write it out for you that way IF your health insurance will pay for it that way.

June 17, 2009 12:24 PM   Subscribe  What are my chances of contracting herpes?   I am moving out of the country in a couple weeks. I have reignited a romance with a former flame. He has genital herpes.  I knew about this before we slept together, and we always used condoms and avoided sex if he had an outbreak. I never contracted herpes while I was with him (I had a blood test after we broke up.)  We're not in any kind of relationship, we just have a special connection. I want to have some great memories and good times with him before I leave.  Is it too much of a risk to have sex, assuming we use a condom and he isn't having an outbreak? The information on the internet seems to be all over the map. One nurse I talked to seemed to think the risk was very minimal, a doctor told me she didn't think it was worth the risk.  Would anti-viral drugs be a possibility?  I'm not sure how to talk to him about this, given that we had sex before and I was fine with it.  I'm just trying to measure the risk before I make a decision. Thanks!  posted by anonymous to Health & Fitness (5 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite       I recently talked to my doctor about this, and she said the risk is pretty low (low, single percentage points, if even) if you do everything right (condoms, anti-virals, avoidance at the right times). You're more at risk as a girl, but condoms more effectively protect you as a female, too. Purely anecdotal, but I have a friend with HSV who was married for 10 years and had two long-term relationships and has never passed it to a partner. But really, it's about your own personal comfort with the risk, right? posted by lunalaguna at 12:35 PM on June 17, 2009 [ 1 favorite ]  Wikipedia : On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk of HSV-2 from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios—meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free—by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. So starting at a 10% risk (annual), if you assume the studied group had sex 100 times / year, the per-incidence trasmission risk would be 1 in 950 . Slap on a condom and have him down some antivirals and you'd looking at a ~1 in 4,000 risk. If you only care about symptomatic infections, then it's 1 in 8,000 per encounter . posted by 1VF5 at 1:08 PM on June 17, 2009  Here is a Savage Love question that is basically the same, with a reversal of genders.  I would recommend this piece of advice , for peace of mind: "Wash thoroughly with soap and water after sex; virii aren't very strong. Soap and hot water kill and/or wash away the herpes virus if it hasn't already made it through a break in your skin. "  Keep in mind that having careful sex with someone who you know the risks about is much safer than having less safe sex with a perfect stranger who could just as easily have something. If you picked up a random guy in the bar, you could be taking the exact same risk. But since you know from the start your partner has herpes, you'll be sure to take the precautions to prevent you from getting it.  Happy fuckin'! posted by Juliet Banana at 1:45 PM on June 17, 2009  Keep in mind that the virus can get into you a lot more easily if you have any breaks in your skin.  Regardless of whether he has any open sores, if you've got (for example) a nick or ingrown hair from bikini line maintenance, or tiny abrasions from the friction of sex, the virus can more easily get into your system.  So keep an eye on your own parts, and be gentle to them.  Use plenty of lube. posted by vytae at 2:09 PM on June 17, 2009  Juliet Banana has it, but obviously be aware that more vigorous washing or any kind of exfoliation is worse, not better. The most important thing is to avoid abrasions or any breaking of the skin. If your partner is not already on an anti-viral, eg Valtrex, daily therapy for him can reduce the odds of spreading the virus (even if he's already asymptomatic). posted by telegraph at 2:54 PM on June 17, 2009 [ 1 favorite ]   « Older Recomend some fund raising software.   |   Am I doomed to be a doormat forever?

Posted on September 30, 2013  by  Anna C.     Has your partner, or potential partner, recently informed you that he or she has been diagnosed with genital herpes? After thinking about it, did you decide to continue with the relationship, despite not being infected with the virus that causes genital herpes yourself? Congratulations — the two of you are now a “discordant couple,” which means that one of you has genital herpes and the other doesn’t. While you might have come to the conclusion that acquiring a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection below the belt won’t be the end of the world, you still might want to stay discordant — and do everything you can to minimize chances of virus transmission.    Condoms, medication, and abstinence during outbreaks can reduce risk for herpes transmission.    You can read all about herpes elsewhere on this blog, but here’s a quick rundown: Genital herpes can be caused by one of two strains of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 or HSV-2. While HSV-1 is more commonly associated with cold sores and HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital herpes, either virus can infect the genital area. One estimate states that 1 out of 6 Americans between 14 to 49 years of age has a genital HSV-2 infection. Since genital herpes infections can also be caused by HSV-1 , the number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.  Barring total abstinence from all sexual activity, you won’t be able to protect yourself completely from acquiring HSV — but there are many steps that you and your partner can take to decrease risk. Studies on discordant couples show that viral transmission can be reduced with condoms, antiviral herpes medications, practicing abstinence when symptoms are present, and patient education.  Condoms  Latex condoms protect against most STDs, especially fluid-borne infections like HIV and gonorrhea. But condoms also provide some protection against STDs that are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, including genital herpes. One large study found that condom usage was associated with lower rates of HSV-2 acquisition — the more frequently someone used condoms, the lower the risk. Unsurprisingly, risk was also associated with frequency of sex acts: People having vaginal or anal intercourse more than twice weekly were 77 percent more likely to acquire HSV-2 than people having less sex.  Other studies have reached similar conclusions, such as this study of monogamous, discordant couples, which found that HSV-2-positive men who used condoms were much less likely to transmit the virus to their female partners. Overall, for every 10,000 acts of vaginal or anal intercourse, 8.9 women acquired HSV-2 from their male partners, while 1.5 men acquired HSV-2 from their female partners. HSV-2 transmission also declined over the course of the study, possibly due to a decline in sexual activity between partners as well as counseling to use condoms and avoid sex during outbreaks.  It is difficult to perform good studies on the effect of condoms on disease transmission, because it’s unethical to ask one group of test subjects not to use condoms, and possibly not realistic to expect another group to use condoms consistently and correctly. Therefore, researchers must rely on self-reported data from their subjects and trust that the information they are providing is reliable and that they were using condoms correctly. However, researchers believe that these types of flaws lead to an underestimation of condoms’ effectiveness — so use ’em!  Herpes Medications (Suppressive Therapy)  A partner with genital herpes can consider daily herpes medications, such as acyclovir, which has been found to reduce viral shedding by as much as 94 percent . These medications, which are called “suppressive therapy” when taken daily, have not only been shown to reduce recurring outbreaks in symptomatic sufferers, but also to reduce asymptomatic shedding, offering another avenue for someone with genital herpes to protect his or her partner.  Other herpes medications include valacyclovir, whose efficacy was studied by a team that found a daily 500 mg. dose offered a 48 percent reduction in risk. Not only did this drug reduce the number of herpes outbreaks experienced by the partners with HSV infections, but it reduced risk for their HSV-negative partners, who were more than twice as likely to acquire HSV-2 from partners who were not taking suppressive therapy. For every 1,000 sex acts there were 0.60 cases of male-to-female herpes transmission and 0.23 female-to-male herpes transmissions. Transmission rates were even lower among couples who used condoms.  There are many alternative remedies , such as plant-based preparations or dietary supplements, touted as prevention against herpes outbreaks or transmission, but in general they are not supported by reliable evidence.  Abstinence During Outbreaks  When someone is experiencing symptoms of a genital herpes outbreak — blisters, itching, open or swollen sores, pain in the infected area — he or she is also “shedding virus,” meaning that HSV can be transmitted to others. Someone also might be able to recognize warning signs of an impending outbreak, such as burning, itching, or tingling sensations. When these types of symptoms are present, it is imperative to practice total abstinence until seven days after the sores heal. Because condoms do not cover the entire genital area, they do not provide adequate protection from the virus (condoms should always be used between outbreaks).  A partner with herpes should also avoid touching the sores, as he or she could transfer the virus to another place on the body (such as the facial area), to a contact lens, or to another person. If you have touched a herpes sore, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water immediately afterward.  Unfortunately, most HSV transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding — when there are no outbreaks.  Patient Education  In the 1980s, before the common use of herpes medications like acyclovir, one group of researchers conducted a study on HSV-2-discordant couples. This represented a “best-case scenario” in that the couples were educated on recognizing mild or atypical herpes outbreaks, were counseled to practice abstinence until four days after sores had healed, were taught about condom use, and were highly motivated to avoid HSV-2 transmission. They concluded that the risk of genital HSV transmission was:   10 percent per year, overall  20 percent per year if the partner without genital herpes had not been previously infected with HSV-1 (the virus most commonly associated with cold sores)  16 percent per year in women who already carried HSV-1  32 percent per year in women who did not carry HSV-1   Presumably, HSV transmission rates are higher in the absence of this education, safer sex practice, and desire to mitigate risk. In this study, the factors that made the biggest difference in whether or not someone caught a genital HSV-2 infection from her partner was the consistent use of condoms and spermicide, even during asymptomatic periods.  If you have a genital HSV infection, you can ask a sexual health expert, such as a provider at Planned Parenthood, to educate you on how to be more aware of any cues that the virus is flaring up. Although truly asymptomatic shedding does occur, patients can be made more aware of how to recognize mild or nonspecific symptoms that might signal an infectious period.  Other Strategies  A healthy immune system can help keep viral infections in check. While there are a lot of dietary supplements out there that claim to “boost” immunity , there actually aren’t any magic bullets to ensure a strong immune system. The best things you can do to boost your immunity are to quit smoking , eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and avoid stress.  Some conditions, like an HIV infection or receiving chemotherapy for cancer, can compromise the immune system, which can make it more difficult for your body to control a herpes infection.   Planned Parenthood health centers have condoms, can diagnose and treat herpes, offer patient education on herpes symptoms and transmission, and can help you decide if herpes medications are right for you.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 19, 2014 at 11:00 pm  said:    Those numbers are per sex act, so depending on how often a couple has sex, the chances per year would be much higher. The risk might be acceptable to some, unacceptable to others.  Here’s the relevant paragraph from the New England Journal of Medicine:  The median number of sexual contacts per couple during the study was 49 in the valacyclovir group and 46 in the placebo group (range, 0 to 482). The frequency of genital HSV-2 acquisition increased with the reported frequency of sexual activity and was 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of valacyclovir recipients, as compared with 0.68 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of placebo recipients. The respective rates of acquisition among susceptible women were 0.60 and 1.27 per 1000 sexual contacts and, among susceptible men, 0.23 and 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 20, 2014 at 1:03 am  said:    So, take this with a grain of salt, as I haven’t taken my biostats classes yet, but I believe these numbers would translate to a 3.07% chance of a female catching herpes from a male after 52 sex acts (say after a year of having sex once a week on average), while a male would have a 1.19% chance of catching herpes from his female partner after 52 sex acts, assuming the person with herpes was taking valacyclovir.  I used this cheat sheet , where the herpes was represented by 52 lottery tickets. T=1000, W=0.6 or W=0.23, and P=52. Take it with a grain of salt as I’m not a statistician!    Reply ↓           John C. on October 9, 2014 at 7:08 am  said:    Ann,  I believe the cheat sheet you used for your calculations would not  be the proper one to use for this example.  You are also using 52 for sex acts based on once a week.  If you were using this number, your number for W would be much less as .6 and .35 are based on 1000 sex acts.  Based on the numbers from the report, to me at least, its saying that for every 1000 sex acts for women susceptible to HSV-2, .6 women contracted the disease when their partner was on Valtrax while 1.27 women contracted it when their partner was not on Valtrax.  If you put this into a percentage, this means .6/1000 and 1.27/1000 for women and .23/1000 and .35/1000 are the only formulas you would need to use.  If it indeed cuts down viral shedding by up to 94%, that is a major factor in the reduction in transmission.  What the report doesn’t say though, is whether the couples abstained during outbreaks.  Now you add condoms to the mix, and its even lower.  I know people that have been on suppressive therapy for years and have not had any outbreaks during that entire time.  Most people who transmit the disease do not know they have it, therefore they are not taking medication to help control it.  I do believe a cure is on the way for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 as they have now determined what causes Herpes to go into latency in both versions of the disease which makes it impossible to kill.  Once a drug can be created and tested that will bring all herpes cells out of hibernation, it can be killed using the same drugs used for suppressive therapy.  Think of it as one massive outbreak bringing the condition to an end.  Its still a ways off due to lack of funding for clinical trials, but search for Duke University and University of Florida herpes research to learn more about this discovery.

If your girlfriend has an HSV-2 infection in her genital region, it can only be transmitted via contact with her genital region — not by kissing. The herpes virus doesn’t hang out in the blood. (According to Ask Alice , small amounts of virus might enter the bloodstream during the first herpes outbreak. So if your girlfriend has had HSV-2 for a while, you don’t have to worry about even that small possibility.)  According to the Red Cross , people with herpes can donate blood: “Chlamydia, venereal warts (human papilloma virus), or genital herpes are not a cause for deferral if you are feeling healthy and well and meet all other eligibility requirements.”    Reply ↓           karen on July 11, 2015 at 1:41 am  said:    Of the 267 Women 9 got it during the study period.  That suggests in active couple that woman likely have 3% chance of getting it after a sustained time period and sexual encounters.  I’d also suspect the results would be in the double digits if we were talking about a couple where they both didn’t know that one of them has it.  The risk is real over time but not a deal breaker if you think the person is the “one”.  Does suggest not to be too casual and have repeated acts with someone that you don’t deem to have long term relationship potential.  >> Participants A total of 528 monogamous couples discordant for HSV-2 infection, including an HSV-2–susceptible population of 261 men and 267 women.

I felt like my life had ended and was worried because we had broken up and I had sex with a new partner while I was on the last day of my period . After I was diagnosed I was paranoid I had passed the virus to my new partner but I had not. We have been having safe sex whilst I have no symptoms of an outbreak and everything has been gud until now. I was again on my last day of my period and we had unprotected sex in the shower with the water running and within less than 3hours of intercourse my parter started complaining about discomfort. Based on my research it says the virus cannot be passed on via the blood but I am concerned the only time my virus seems to b passing on is during my period.  We are going to the doctor tomorrow and I’m praying that he hasn’t contracted the virus from me .

However, some things can “trigger” the virus, including menstruation . To reduce risk of transmitting the virus to your partner, it’s important to use condoms each and every time, in combination with other risk-reducing strategies like medications (acyclovir).  Good luck, and the doctor should be able to answer your questions. Make sure to write them down first, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting to ask.

We been married for 22 yrs. now and I found out 2 yrs. ago I hve genital hsv2  from a past relationship like over 20 yrs. ago.  Can she get genital hsv2 from me if we continue to have unprotected sex?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on December 26, 2015 at 9:44 am  said:    Yes. Because HSV-2 can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, you can pass the virus to your wife during sex. Condoms will reduce the risk but are limited by how much skin they cover. If she has HSV-1 she has some , but not complete, protection from symptoms of an HSV-2 infection. Has your wife had a blood test for HSV-2? It’s possible she already has it, but never got symptoms. Most people with HSV-1 or HSV-2 don’t get symptoms.    Reply ↓         married couple on December 26, 2015 at 9:56 am  said:    Yes she’s been tested and she is negative.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on December 26, 2015 at 11:03 am  said:    I don’t remember seeing any studies on whether a person with a long-term asymptomatic HSV-2 infection can stop shedding the virus completely, but I’ll take another look and see if I can find one. But probably the best thing to do is to talk to a qualified health care provider for advice on whether you should start using condoms or taking suppressive medication. It also depends on how your wife feels about the possibility of getting HSV-2. Some people are willing to take the risk.

Unfortunately, it’s often impossible to know where an HSV infection came from. It also depends on how you found out about your HSV infection — did you have an outbreak that was confirmed as herpes, or did you have a blood test that showed you had been exposed to HSV? Most people will test positive for HSV-1 on a blood test, but if they don’t have symptoms they can’t know for sure if the infection is located in their facial area, genital area, or both. If you decide to tell your ex-boyfriend, you might find some of these tips helpful.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on February 28, 2016 at 9:00 pm  said:    Suppressive therapy dramatically reduces risk of HSV transmission, and there is less risk of transmission when symptoms are not present, but it is still possible to transmit HSV even when you have no symptoms and are on anti-herpes medications. Someone with an HSV-1 infection in the genitals might not have as severe symptoms if later infected in the genitals with HSV-2, though it is possible to be infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the same part of the body. You and your wife will have to decide what level of risk you’re OK with, and might want to talk to a knowledgeable doctor to get all of your questions answered. Good luck!

You would need to ask your health-care provider to look at your medical records to answer your specific questions, but most STD screening does not include blood tests for herpes, so it’s possible you hadn’t been tested until now. Also, since most people get HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) in childhood, most of us will test positive for it.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on April 1, 2016 at 3:10 pm  said:    Whether to disclose herpes status is a question that a lot of people have when first learning of their diagnosis, especially when they learn how common herpes is despite being stigmatized. People can reduce risk of transmitting the virus to a partner by taking FDA-approved herpes medications such as acyclovir, which decreases the amount of virus that a person can “shed” from their body. While this type of medication can be used along with other risk-reducing methods, like abstinence during outbreaks and condoms or dental dams during other sexual contact, it does not reduce the risk to zero.  However, healthy relationships are built on trust, and talking about HIV/STD status is an important conversation for people to have when first getting together. It might be a difficult conversation, but it’s an important one for all sexually active people to learn to do, regardless of their own HIV/STD status. It is a time to talk about health, boundaries, and what activities you’re into. Disclosing your status can be one part of a larger, and very important, conversation that can help form the foundation of a healthy relationship.

I’m so lost  and upset I want to know how can I not give it to my guy friend that I’m with now because he doesn’t like using condoms and I want to know when am I shedding and also we had unprotected sex 2 times . I felt disgusting with my self when I first found out so I’m asking what should I do?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 3, 2016 at 9:26 pm  said:    Unfortunately, you can’t know when you’re shedding, though sometimes there are signs (e.g., a tingling sensation) that people can recognize. But just because there are no symptoms doesn’t mean you’re not shedding — that can happen with no symptoms at all.  The best way to avoid transmission is to practice abstinence during outbreaks (until a week after sores have healed), to take anti-herpes medications, and to use condoms. Communication is also important. Your guy can decide for himself what risks he is comfortable taking, and he can also get a blood test (if he hasn’t already) to find out if he is already a carrier for either type of herpes. Most people have HSV-1, and HSV-2 is also very common, though the vast majority of people who have it don’t know it, because they never have symptoms.  Please don’t feel disgusting! You are not defined by the viruses in your cells. Everyone has viruses — they are a fact of life — but society chooses to view certain viruses as taboo. It is so unfortunate that so many of us are made to feel shame for our STD status. Shame doesn’t help anyone. Good luck!

Now, I have read a lot on the internet about infected people taking Valtrex as suppressive therapy to reduce the risk of transmission to healthy individuals, but what I would like to know is, what if *I* (HSV-free) choose to take valacyclovir to prevent my chance of getting infected from *her*? I could not find anything online to address the chance of contracting HSV from a known infected person if the *healthy* person decides to take the medication to lower their risk of infection. Any information would be appreciated.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 14, 2016 at 3:49 pm  said:    Hi Jeff! It’s a good question, but I’m unaware of any studies on using acyclovir to prevent HSV acquisition in people who don’t have the virus. Using Google, I found this webpage , which says that no research has been performed to answer this question (I’ve never heard of that website and don’t necessarily endorse it). Using PubMed, I wasn’t able to find any article addressing the question either. I did find an article assessing the effectiveness of a different drug (not acyclovir) in protecting HSV-negative people from acquiring the virus — while it had encouraging results, I don’t think this drug has been well-studied as pre-exposure prophylaxis either, but it’s worth a closer look.  The thing is, you would need a doctor to prescribe the acyclovir, and if you’re negative for HSV-2 or don’t have symptoms for HSV-1 (which most people will test positive for), a doctor might not prescribe it — the drawbacks (e.g., cost and side effects) might not be worth the benefits (e.g., avoiding HSV-2 acquisition, which is not a proven benefit). A good thing for sexual partners to do before getting together is to discuss their STD status, and go in for testing together. As I said in my reply to another comment to this post, healthy relationships are built on trust, and having “the talk” about your status is an important conversation to learn how to have. It may be a difficult conversation, but it can serve as an opportunity to talk not just about health, but also about boundaries, likes, dislikes, etc. Good communication is the foundation for healthy relationships, whether they are long-term or short-term.

We had a great talk about it, where she told me and I told her I would love to keep seeing her. But I am so new to this where as I only remember education from school. Protected sex thus far. But what about when she gives me oral sex, how high are risks? And what about sleeping throughout the night with no clothes on and “spoon” as we typically do? What about foreplay like using my hands and such? And last, what about towels that have her bodily fluids on them? Reading this article and the comments and replays have helped tremendously. Sorry if any of these questions are stupid, but I feel the more educated we are the better the relationship.

Even if you broke up with him to “spare” him from getting the virus from you, chances are that his next girlfriend would have the virus that causes cold sores as well. This seems like a decision for him to make on his own. Find some good information on cold sores to share with him so his decision can be informed. Good luck!

HSV-1 is usually associated with cold sores, and most people get it when they’re children, but it can easily be spread to the genitals by oral sex. Since HSV-1 is incredibly common (even in people who never get cold sores), the chances are high that your current husband already has HSV-1. If you tell your husband about your diagnosis, you can make sure to share all the important facts with him — the World Health Organization has an excellent webpage about herpes simplex virus.  If the doctor who diagnosed you with HSV-1 can’t answer your questions, you can make an appointment at a Planned Parenthood health center to talk to someone very well-versed in sexual health. Make sure you write all your questions down so you don’t forget them. Good luck!

Parameters are what we are ultimately seeking to discover in science. If you roll the dice in a specific way from a specific starting position you will always roll a 4. That is better than saying I have a 0.2 percent chance of contacted a disease this week. I know darn well that if there is oozing slime landing in my mouth I am pretty much gonna get infected.  For the love of reality, please give some more details on the virus. I think we all would benefit from more parameters about this virus.I am asking for something more quantitative:  Can you provide average and maximum lifetime of herpes virus in the blood? Can you provide some information on what maximum and minimum temperature will inactive/kill herpes virus and the amount of time required?  I am asking because I am tired of getting information that doesn’t help me. I am represented by parameters not statistics. Parameters represent the reality. Statistics represents everything we can’t fully describe yet but generalizes. In an age when we all want to believe we are exceptional and we all try to consume ourselves into being better than our neighbors can you provide some more scientific details.

Genital herpes is an STD caused by two types of viruses. The viruses are called herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).  What is oral herpes?  Oral herpes is usually caused by HSV-1 and can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes were infected during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva.  Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?  Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can be spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex . This is why some cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-1.  How common is genital herpes?  Genital herpes is common in the United States. More than one out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.  How is genital herpes spread?  You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the disease.  If you do not have herpes, you can get infected if you come into contact with the herpes virus in:   A herpes sore;  Saliva (if your partner has an oral herpes infection) or genital secretions (if your partner has a genital herpes infection);  Skin in the oral area if your partner has an oral herpes infection, or skin in the genital area if your partner has a genital herpes infection.   You can get herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or who may not know he or she is infected. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a sex partner who has oral herpes.  You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools, or from touching objects around you such as silverware, soap, or towels. If you have additional questions about how herpes is spread, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.    How can I reduce my risk of getting genital herpes?  The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:   Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results);  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.   Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that are covered by a latex condom. Also, herpes virus can be released (shed) from areas of the skin that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.  If you are in a relationship with a person known to have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting genital herpes if:   Your partner takes an anti-herpes medication every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her doctor.  You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., when your partner is having an outbreak).    I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?  If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, it is very important for you to go to prenatal care visits. Tell your doctor if you have ever had symptoms of, or have been diagnosed with, genital herpes. Also tell your doctor if you have ever been exposed to genital herpes. There is some research that suggests that genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage, or could make it more likely for you to deliver your baby too early.  Herpes infection can be passed from you to your unborn child before birth but is more commonly passed to your infant during delivery. This can lead to a potentially deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting herpes during pregnancy. If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, you may be offered anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes at the time of delivery. At the time of delivery, your doctor should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have herpes symptoms at delivery, a ‘C-section’ is usually performed.  How do I know if I have genital herpes?  Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms, or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people who have herpes do not know it.  Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. These symptoms are sometimes called “having an outbreak.” The first time someone has an outbreak they may also have flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, or swollen glands.  People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if they are infected with HSV-2. Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although the infection stays in the body for the rest of your life, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.  You should be examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms or if your partner has an STD or symptoms of an STD. STD symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when urinating, or (for women) bleeding between periods.  How will my doctor know if I have herpes?  Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at your symptoms. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. In certain situations, a blood test may be used to look for herpes antibodies. Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask whether you should be tested for herpes or other STDs.  Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or how long you have been infected.  Can herpes be cured?  There is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. One of these anti-herpes medicines can be taken daily, and makes it less likely that you will pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).  What happens if I don’t get treated?  Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.  If you touch your sores or the fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another part of your body, such as your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, immediately wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading your infection.  If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your developing fetus, or newborn baby. See “ I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby? ” above for information about this.  Can I still have sex if I have herpes?  If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) and let him or her know that you do and the risk involved. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.  You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your overall health, sex life, and relationships. It is best for you to talk to a health care provider about those concerns, but it also is important to recognize that while herpes is not curable, it can be managed with medication. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) for herpes can also lower your risk of spreading genital herpes to your sex partner. Be sure to discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. Since a genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships, it is important to understand how to talk to sexual partners about STDs .  What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?  Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, having genital herpes increases the number of CD4 cells (the cells that HIV targets for entry into the body) found in the lining of the genitals. When a person has both HIV and genital herpes, the chances are higher that HIV will be spread to an HIV-uninfected sex partner during sexual contact with their partner’s mouth, vagina, or rectum.

Genital Herpes is an STD caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2, although, mostly caused by HSV-2. Genital herpes is a contagious viral infection affecting primarily the genitals of men and women. Genital herpes is characterized by recurrent clusters of vesicles and lesions at the genital areas or below the waist. The female genital areas are on or near the pubis, vulva, labia, clitoris, buttocks or rectum.
    The areas for male genital herpes include on or around the penis, the inner thigh, buttocks, or rectum. Proctitis, or inflammation of the rectum, can be due to HSV. A person usually gets HSV-2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection. Transmission may occur even if there is no visible outbreak if the infected person is shedding . 80 percent of people don't even know they have it. In the United States alone, there are about 500,000 new cases of genital herpes infections annually. While generally not dangerous, it is a nuisance and can be emotionally traumatic, as there is no cure.  The number of HSV-1 genital herpes infections is rising. It is no longer the rule that HSV-1 is above the waist. If you receive unprotected oral sex from someone infected with cold sores, you can contract HSV-1 on your genitals. Do not give oral sex if you have an active cold sore or if you are feeling the prodromal symptoms .   Red Marine Algae and VIR-L-Lysine can help to suppress genital herpes outbreaks!      Facts About Genital Herpes:    Transmission is caused by close oral, anal, or genital contact, including intercourse, masturbation, kissing, or any direct skin-to-skin contact which allows for the transfer of bodily fluids.  A person is considered contagious when prodromal symptoms, active sores, and healing lesions are present.  Herpes is potentially contagious when no symptoms are present. That is, a person who has genital herpes is potentially always shedding active virus.  Approximately 1 in 6 members of the general infected population is thought to shed active virus occasionally without symptoms.  Some people do not get typical blister-like sores but harbor active virus in their saliva, vaginal, or penile secretions, and can shed the virus without knowing they have herpes.  Lesions can occur deep inside the vagina where they cannot be seen or felt, but can readily transmit the virus.  An uninfected individual has about a 75% chance of contracting herpes during intimate contact with someone actively shedding virus.  Oral herpes can be transmitted to the genitals, and vice versa. Symptoms are similar.  Auto-inoculation: An infected individual can spread the virus to other parts of his or her body by touching an area shedding virus and then touching, scratching, or rubbing another susceptible part of the body. Towels are especially conducive to this.  It is possible for a person to contract genital herpes if the partner with oral herpes performs oral sex. Oral herpes can be transmitted to the genitals, and vice versa. Symptoms are similar.  Environmental surfaces like toilet seats may be a source of contagion, but there is no evidence that this poses a real threat to the general population. Experts differ as to how long the virus can survive on its own. The primary cause of infection remains intimate contact.    Theory of Cause: ...Dr. C.N. Look  Herpes simplex viruses include two distinct but closely related viruses, namely, HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both viruses can cause genital herpes. Roughly speaking, HSV-2 causes 90% and HSV-1 causes 10% of all genital herpes. Herpes simplex virus is a linear double-stranded DNA virus. HSV-1 and HSV-2 share approximately 50% homology of their genetic materials and they even express type-common surface antigens. It accounts for the high degree of cross-reactivity and the technical difficulty in differentiating the 2 viruses. On the other hand, HSV-1 & HSV-2 antibodies offer some degree of cross protection. Cell-mediated immune responses is more important than humoral responses in determining the severity of HSV infections. Hence, AIDS patients often have chronic and severe anogenital herpes. Genital herpes is usually transmitted by sexual intercourse. Direct inoculation of virus occurs through contact with infected secretions or mucosal surfaces. Orogenital contact with a partner with type 1 herpes labialis can also result in genital herpes. Asymptomatic shedding of HSV is the most common mode of transmission of genital herpes infection. It is estimated that more than half of the HSV-2 genital infections are asymptomatic.

Posted on September 30, 2013  by  Anna C.     Has your partner, or potential partner, recently informed you that he or she has been diagnosed with genital herpes? After thinking about it, did you decide to continue with the relationship, despite not being infected with the virus that causes genital herpes yourself? Congratulations — the two of you are now a “discordant couple,” which means that one of you has genital herpes and the other doesn’t. While you might have come to the conclusion that acquiring a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection below the belt won’t be the end of the world, you still might want to stay discordant — and do everything you can to minimize chances of virus transmission.    Condoms, medication, and abstinence during outbreaks can reduce risk for herpes transmission.    You can read all about herpes elsewhere on this blog, but here’s a quick rundown: Genital herpes can be caused by one of two strains of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 or HSV-2. While HSV-1 is more commonly associated with cold sores and HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital herpes, either virus can infect the genital area. One estimate states that 1 out of 6 Americans between 14 to 49 years of age has a genital HSV-2 infection. Since genital herpes infections can also be caused by HSV-1 , the number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.  Barring total abstinence from all sexual activity, you won’t be able to protect yourself completely from acquiring HSV — but there are many steps that you and your partner can take to decrease risk. Studies on discordant couples show that viral transmission can be reduced with condoms, antiviral herpes medications, practicing abstinence when symptoms are present, and patient education.  Condoms  Latex condoms protect against most STDs, especially fluid-borne infections like HIV and gonorrhea. But condoms also provide some protection against STDs that are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, including genital herpes. One large study found that condom usage was associated with lower rates of HSV-2 acquisition — the more frequently someone used condoms, the lower the risk. Unsurprisingly, risk was also associated with frequency of sex acts: People having vaginal or anal intercourse more than twice weekly were 77 percent more likely to acquire HSV-2 than people having less sex.  Other studies have reached similar conclusions, such as this study of monogamous, discordant couples, which found that HSV-2-positive men who used condoms were much less likely to transmit the virus to their female partners. Overall, for every 10,000 acts of vaginal or anal intercourse, 8.9 women acquired HSV-2 from their male partners, while 1.5 men acquired HSV-2 from their female partners. HSV-2 transmission also declined over the course of the study, possibly due to a decline in sexual activity between partners as well as counseling to use condoms and avoid sex during outbreaks.  It is difficult to perform good studies on the effect of condoms on disease transmission, because it’s unethical to ask one group of test subjects not to use condoms, and possibly not realistic to expect another group to use condoms consistently and correctly. Therefore, researchers must rely on self-reported data from their subjects and trust that the information they are providing is reliable and that they were using condoms correctly. However, researchers believe that these types of flaws lead to an underestimation of condoms’ effectiveness — so use ’em!  Herpes Medications (Suppressive Therapy)  A partner with genital herpes can consider daily herpes medications, such as acyclovir, which has been found to reduce viral shedding by as much as 94 percent . These medications, which are called “suppressive therapy” when taken daily, have not only been shown to reduce recurring outbreaks in symptomatic sufferers, but also to reduce asymptomatic shedding, offering another avenue for someone with genital herpes to protect his or her partner.  Other herpes medications include valacyclovir, whose efficacy was studied by a team that found a daily 500 mg. dose offered a 48 percent reduction in risk. Not only did this drug reduce the number of herpes outbreaks experienced by the partners with HSV infections, but it reduced risk for their HSV-negative partners, who were more than twice as likely to acquire HSV-2 from partners who were not taking suppressive therapy. For every 1,000 sex acts there were 0.60 cases of male-to-female herpes transmission and 0.23 female-to-male herpes transmissions. Transmission rates were even lower among couples who used condoms.  There are many alternative remedies , such as plant-based preparations or dietary supplements, touted as prevention against herpes outbreaks or transmission, but in general they are not supported by reliable evidence.  Abstinence During Outbreaks  When someone is experiencing symptoms of a genital herpes outbreak — blisters, itching, open or swollen sores, pain in the infected area — he or she is also “shedding virus,” meaning that HSV can be transmitted to others. Someone also might be able to recognize warning signs of an impending outbreak, such as burning, itching, or tingling sensations. When these types of symptoms are present, it is imperative to practice total abstinence until seven days after the sores heal. Because condoms do not cover the entire genital area, they do not provide adequate protection from the virus (condoms should always be used between outbreaks).  A partner with herpes should also avoid touching the sores, as he or she could transfer the virus to another place on the body (such as the facial area), to a contact lens, or to another person. If you have touched a herpes sore, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water immediately afterward.  Unfortunately, most HSV transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding — when there are no outbreaks.  Patient Education  In the 1980s, before the common use of herpes medications like acyclovir, one group of researchers conducted a study on HSV-2-discordant couples. This represented a “best-case scenario” in that the couples were educated on recognizing mild or atypical herpes outbreaks, were counseled to practice abstinence until four days after sores had healed, were taught about condom use, and were highly motivated to avoid HSV-2 transmission. They concluded that the risk of genital HSV transmission was:   10 percent per year, overall  20 percent per year if the partner without genital herpes had not been previously infected with HSV-1 (the virus most commonly associated with cold sores)  16 percent per year in women who already carried HSV-1  32 percent per year in women who did not carry HSV-1   Presumably, HSV transmission rates are higher in the absence of this education, safer sex practice, and desire to mitigate risk. In this study, the factors that made the biggest difference in whether or not someone caught a genital HSV-2 infection from her partner was the consistent use of condoms and spermicide, even during asymptomatic periods.  If you have a genital HSV infection, you can ask a sexual health expert, such as a provider at Planned Parenthood, to educate you on how to be more aware of any cues that the virus is flaring up. Although truly asymptomatic shedding does occur, patients can be made more aware of how to recognize mild or nonspecific symptoms that might signal an infectious period.  Other Strategies  A healthy immune system can help keep viral infections in check. While there are a lot of dietary supplements out there that claim to “boost” immunity , there actually aren’t any magic bullets to ensure a strong immune system. The best things you can do to boost your immunity are to quit smoking , eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and avoid stress.  Some conditions, like an HIV infection or receiving chemotherapy for cancer, can compromise the immune system, which can make it more difficult for your body to control a herpes infection.   Planned Parenthood health centers have condoms, can diagnose and treat herpes, offer patient education on herpes symptoms and transmission, and can help you decide if herpes medications are right for you.

So an even less than 1 in 1,000 chance if one person is on meds?  What’s the big deal then?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 19, 2014 at 11:00 pm  said:    Those numbers are per sex act, so depending on how often a couple has sex, the chances per year would be much higher. The risk might be acceptable to some, unacceptable to others.  Here’s the relevant paragraph from the New England Journal of Medicine:  The median number of sexual contacts per couple during the study was 49 in the valacyclovir group and 46 in the placebo group (range, 0 to 482). The frequency of genital HSV-2 acquisition increased with the reported frequency of sexual activity and was 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of valacyclovir recipients, as compared with 0.68 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of placebo recipients. The respective rates of acquisition among susceptible women were 0.60 and 1.27 per 1000 sexual contacts and, among susceptible men, 0.23 and 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts.

I used this cheat sheet , where the herpes was represented by 52 lottery tickets. T=1000, W=0.6 or W=0.23, and P=52. Take it with a grain of salt as I’m not a statistician!    Reply ↓           John C. on October 9, 2014 at 7:08 am  said:    Ann,  I believe the cheat sheet you used for your calculations would not  be the proper one to use for this example.  You are also using 52 for sex acts based on once a week.  If you were using this number, your number for W would be much less as .6 and .35 are based on 1000 sex acts.  Based on the numbers from the report, to me at least, its saying that for every 1000 sex acts for women susceptible to HSV-2, .6 women contracted the disease when their partner was on Valtrax while 1.27 women contracted it when their partner was not on Valtrax.  If you put this into a percentage, this means .6/1000 and 1.27/1000 for women and .23/1000 and .35/1000 are the only formulas you would need to use.  If it indeed cuts down viral shedding by up to 94%, that is a major factor in the reduction in transmission.  What the report doesn’t say though, is whether the couples abstained during outbreaks.  Now you add condoms to the mix, and its even lower.  I know people that have been on suppressive therapy for years and have not had any outbreaks during that entire time.  Most people who transmit the disease do not know they have it, therefore they are not taking medication to help control it.  I do believe a cure is on the way for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 as they have now determined what causes Herpes to go into latency in both versions of the disease which makes it impossible to kill.  Once a drug can be created and tested that will bring all herpes cells out of hibernation, it can be killed using the same drugs used for suppressive therapy.  Think of it as one massive outbreak bringing the condition to an end.  Its still a ways off due to lack of funding for clinical trials, but search for Duke University and University of Florida herpes research to learn more about this discovery.

If your girlfriend has an HSV-2 infection in her genital region, it can only be transmitted via contact with her genital region — not by kissing. The herpes virus doesn’t hang out in the blood. (According to Ask Alice , small amounts of virus might enter the bloodstream during the first herpes outbreak. So if your girlfriend has had HSV-2 for a while, you don’t have to worry about even that small possibility.)  According to the Red Cross , people with herpes can donate blood: “Chlamydia, venereal warts (human papilloma virus), or genital herpes are not a cause for deferral if you are feeling healthy and well and meet all other eligibility requirements.”    Reply ↓           karen on July 11, 2015 at 1:41 am  said:    Of the 267 Women 9 got it during the study period.  That suggests in active couple that woman likely have 3% chance of getting it after a sustained time period and sexual encounters.  I’d also suspect the results would be in the double digits if we were talking about a couple where they both didn’t know that one of them has it.  The risk is real over time but not a deal breaker if you think the person is the “one”.  Does suggest not to be too casual and have repeated acts with someone that you don’t deem to have long term relationship potential.  >> Participants A total of 528 monogamous couples discordant for HSV-2 infection, including an HSV-2–susceptible population of 261 men and 267 women.

My partner complained of discomfort after sex with me and when I checked it out a week later I had the virus and a blister on my anus. I felt like my life had ended and was worried because we had broken up and I had sex with a new partner while I was on the last day of my period . After I was diagnosed I was paranoid I had passed the virus to my new partner but I had not. We have been having safe sex whilst I have no symptoms of an outbreak and everything has been gud until now. I was again on my last day of my period and we had unprotected sex in the shower with the water running and within less than 3hours of intercourse my parter started complaining about discomfort. Based on my research it says the virus cannot be passed on via the blood but I am concerned the only time my virus seems to b passing on is during my period.  We are going to the doctor tomorrow and I’m praying that he hasn’t contracted the virus from me .

However, some things can “trigger” the virus, including menstruation . To reduce risk of transmitting the virus to your partner, it’s important to use condoms each and every time, in combination with other risk-reducing strategies like medications (acyclovir).  Good luck, and the doctor should be able to answer your questions. Make sure to write them down first, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting to ask.

Because HSV-2 can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, you can pass the virus to your wife during sex. Condoms will reduce the risk but are limited by how much skin they cover. If she has HSV-1 she has some , but not complete, protection from symptoms of an HSV-2 infection. Has your wife had a blood test for HSV-2? It’s possible she already has it, but never got symptoms. Most people with HSV-1 or HSV-2 don’t get symptoms.    Reply ↓         married couple on December 26, 2015 at 9:56 am  said:    Yes she’s been tested and she is negative.

But probably the best thing to do is to talk to a qualified health care provider for advice on whether you should start using condoms or taking suppressive medication. It also depends on how your wife feels about the possibility of getting HSV-2. Some people are willing to take the risk.

Unfortunately, it’s often impossible to know where an HSV infection came from. It also depends on how you found out about your HSV infection — did you have an outbreak that was confirmed as herpes, or did you have a blood test that showed you had been exposed to HSV? Most people will test positive for HSV-1 on a blood test, but if they don’t have symptoms they can’t know for sure if the infection is located in their facial area, genital area, or both.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on February 28, 2016 at 9:00 pm  said:    Suppressive therapy dramatically reduces risk of HSV transmission, and there is less risk of transmission when symptoms are not present, but it is still possible to transmit HSV even when you have no symptoms and are on anti-herpes medications. Someone with an HSV-1 infection in the genitals might not have as severe symptoms if later infected in the genitals with HSV-2, though it is possible to be infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the same part of the body. You and your wife will have to decide what level of risk you’re OK with, and might want to talk to a knowledgeable doctor to get all of your questions answered. Good luck!

You would need to ask your health-care provider to look at your medical records to answer your specific questions, but most STD screening does not include blood tests for herpes, so it’s possible you hadn’t been tested until now. Also, since most people get HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) in childhood, most of us will test positive for it.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on April 1, 2016 at 3:10 pm  said:    Whether to disclose herpes status is a question that a lot of people have when first learning of their diagnosis, especially when they learn how common herpes is despite being stigmatized. People can reduce risk of transmitting the virus to a partner by taking FDA-approved herpes medications such as acyclovir, which decreases the amount of virus that a person can “shed” from their body. While this type of medication can be used along with other risk-reducing methods, like abstinence during outbreaks and condoms or dental dams during other sexual contact, it does not reduce the risk to zero.  However, healthy relationships are built on trust, and talking about HIV/STD status is an important conversation for people to have when first getting together. It might be a difficult conversation, but it’s an important one for all sexually active people to learn to do, regardless of their own HIV/STD status. It is a time to talk about health, boundaries, and what activities you’re into. Disclosing your status can be one part of a larger, and very important, conversation that can help form the foundation of a healthy relationship.

But just because there are no symptoms doesn’t mean you’re not shedding — that can happen with no symptoms at all.  The best way to avoid transmission is to practice abstinence during outbreaks (until a week after sores have healed), to take anti-herpes medications, and to use condoms. Communication is also important. Your guy can decide for himself what risks he is comfortable taking, and he can also get a blood test (if he hasn’t already) to find out if he is already a carrier for either type of herpes. Most people have HSV-1, and HSV-2 is also very common, though the vast majority of people who have it don’t know it, because they never have symptoms.  Please don’t feel disgusting! You are not defined by the viruses in your cells. Everyone has viruses — they are a fact of life — but society chooses to view certain viruses as taboo. It is so unfortunate that so many of us are made to feel shame for our STD status. Shame doesn’t help anyone. Good luck!

I could not find anything online to address the chance of contracting HSV from a known infected person if the *healthy* person decides to take the medication to lower their risk of infection. Any information would be appreciated.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 14, 2016 at 3:49 pm  said:    Hi Jeff! It’s a good question, but I’m unaware of any studies on using acyclovir to prevent HSV acquisition in people who don’t have the virus. Using Google, I found this webpage , which says that no research has been performed to answer this question (I’ve never heard of that website and don’t necessarily endorse it). Using PubMed, I wasn’t able to find any article addressing the question either. I did find an article assessing the effectiveness of a different drug (not acyclovir) in protecting HSV-negative people from acquiring the virus — while it had encouraging results, I don’t think this drug has been well-studied as pre-exposure prophylaxis either, but it’s worth a closer look.  The thing is, you would need a doctor to prescribe the acyclovir, and if you’re negative for HSV-2 or don’t have symptoms for HSV-1 (which most people will test positive for), a doctor might not prescribe it — the drawbacks (e.g., cost and side effects) might not be worth the benefits (e.g., avoiding HSV-2 acquisition, which is not a proven benefit). A good thing for sexual partners to do before getting together is to discuss their STD status, and go in for testing together. As I said in my reply to another comment to this post, healthy relationships are built on trust, and having “the talk” about your status is an important conversation to learn how to have. It may be a difficult conversation, but it can serve as an opportunity to talk not just about health, but also about boundaries, likes, dislikes, etc. Good communication is the foundation for healthy relationships, whether they are long-term or short-term.

HSV-1 is usually associated with cold sores, and most people get it when they’re children, but it can easily be spread to the genitals by oral sex. Since HSV-1 is incredibly common (even in people who never get cold sores), the chances are high that your current husband already has HSV-1. If you tell your husband about your diagnosis, you can make sure to share all the important facts with him — the World Health Organization has an excellent webpage about herpes simplex virus.  If the doctor who diagnosed you with HSV-1 can’t answer your questions, you can make an appointment at a Planned Parenthood health center to talk to someone very well-versed in sexual health. Make sure you write all your questions down so you don’t forget them. Good luck!

Posted on September 30, 2013  by  Anna C.     Has your partner, or potential partner, recently informed you that he or she has been diagnosed with genital herpes? After thinking about it, did you decide to continue with the relationship, despite not being infected with the virus that causes genital herpes yourself? Congratulations — the two of you are now a “discordant couple,” which means that one of you has genital herpes and the other doesn’t. While you might have come to the conclusion that acquiring a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection below the belt won’t be the end of the world, you still might want to stay discordant — and do everything you can to minimize chances of virus transmission.    Condoms, medication, and abstinence during outbreaks can reduce risk for herpes transmission.    You can read all about herpes elsewhere on this blog, but here’s a quick rundown: Genital herpes can be caused by one of two strains of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 or HSV-2. While HSV-1 is more commonly associated with cold sores and HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital herpes, either virus can infect the genital area. One estimate states that 1 out of 6 Americans between 14 to 49 years of age has a genital HSV-2 infection. Since genital herpes infections can also be caused by HSV-1 , the number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.  Barring total abstinence from all sexual activity, you won’t be able to protect yourself completely from acquiring HSV — but there are many steps that you and your partner can take to decrease risk. Studies on discordant couples show that viral transmission can be reduced with condoms, antiviral herpes medications, practicing abstinence when symptoms are present, and patient education.  Condoms  Latex condoms protect against most STDs, especially fluid-borne infections like HIV and gonorrhea. But condoms also provide some protection against STDs that are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, including genital herpes. One large study found that condom usage was associated with lower rates of HSV-2 acquisition — the more frequently someone used condoms, the lower the risk. Unsurprisingly, risk was also associated with frequency of sex acts: People having vaginal or anal intercourse more than twice weekly were 77 percent more likely to acquire HSV-2 than people having less sex.  Other studies have reached similar conclusions, such as this study of monogamous, discordant couples, which found that HSV-2-positive men who used condoms were much less likely to transmit the virus to their female partners. Overall, for every 10,000 acts of vaginal or anal intercourse, 8.9 women acquired HSV-2 from their male partners, while 1.5 men acquired HSV-2 from their female partners. HSV-2 transmission also declined over the course of the study, possibly due to a decline in sexual activity between partners as well as counseling to use condoms and avoid sex during outbreaks.  It is difficult to perform good studies on the effect of condoms on disease transmission, because it’s unethical to ask one group of test subjects not to use condoms, and possibly not realistic to expect another group to use condoms consistently and correctly. Therefore, researchers must rely on self-reported data from their subjects and trust that the information they are providing is reliable and that they were using condoms correctly. However, researchers believe that these types of flaws lead to an underestimation of condoms’ effectiveness — so use ’em!  Herpes Medications (Suppressive Therapy)  A partner with genital herpes can consider daily herpes medications, such as acyclovir, which has been found to reduce viral shedding by as much as 94 percent . These medications, which are called “suppressive therapy” when taken daily, have not only been shown to reduce recurring outbreaks in symptomatic sufferers, but also to reduce asymptomatic shedding, offering another avenue for someone with genital herpes to protect his or her partner.  Other herpes medications include valacyclovir, whose efficacy was studied by a team that found a daily 500 mg. dose offered a 48 percent reduction in risk. Not only did this drug reduce the number of herpes outbreaks experienced by the partners with HSV infections, but it reduced risk for their HSV-negative partners, who were more than twice as likely to acquire HSV-2 from partners who were not taking suppressive therapy. For every 1,000 sex acts there were 0.60 cases of male-to-female herpes transmission and 0.23 female-to-male herpes transmissions. Transmission rates were even lower among couples who used condoms.  There are many alternative remedies , such as plant-based preparations or dietary supplements, touted as prevention against herpes outbreaks or transmission, but in general they are not supported by reliable evidence.  Abstinence During Outbreaks  When someone is experiencing symptoms of a genital herpes outbreak — blisters, itching, open or swollen sores, pain in the infected area — he or she is also “shedding virus,” meaning that HSV can be transmitted to others. Someone also might be able to recognize warning signs of an impending outbreak, such as burning, itching, or tingling sensations. When these types of symptoms are present, it is imperative to practice total abstinence until seven days after the sores heal. Because condoms do not cover the entire genital area, they do not provide adequate protection from the virus (condoms should always be used between outbreaks).  A partner with herpes should also avoid touching the sores, as he or she could transfer the virus to another place on the body (such as the facial area), to a contact lens, or to another person. If you have touched a herpes sore, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water immediately afterward.  Unfortunately, most HSV transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding — when there are no outbreaks.  Patient Education  In the 1980s, before the common use of herpes medications like acyclovir, one group of researchers conducted a study on HSV-2-discordant couples. This represented a “best-case scenario” in that the couples were educated on recognizing mild or atypical herpes outbreaks, were counseled to practice abstinence until four days after sores had healed, were taught about condom use, and were highly motivated to avoid HSV-2 transmission. They concluded that the risk of genital HSV transmission was:   10 percent per year, overall  20 percent per year if the partner without genital herpes had not been previously infected with HSV-1 (the virus most commonly associated with cold sores)  16 percent per year in women who already carried HSV-1  32 percent per year in women who did not carry HSV-1   Presumably, HSV transmission rates are higher in the absence of this education, safer sex practice, and desire to mitigate risk. In this study, the factors that made the biggest difference in whether or not someone caught a genital HSV-2 infection from her partner was the consistent use of condoms and spermicide, even during asymptomatic periods.  If you have a genital HSV infection, you can ask a sexual health expert, such as a provider at Planned Parenthood, to educate you on how to be more aware of any cues that the virus is flaring up. Although truly asymptomatic shedding does occur, patients can be made more aware of how to recognize mild or nonspecific symptoms that might signal an infectious period.  Other Strategies  A healthy immune system can help keep viral infections in check. While there are a lot of dietary supplements out there that claim to “boost” immunity , there actually aren’t any magic bullets to ensure a strong immune system. The best things you can do to boost your immunity are to quit smoking , eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and avoid stress.  Some conditions, like an HIV infection or receiving chemotherapy for cancer, can compromise the immune system, which can make it more difficult for your body to control a herpes infection.   Planned Parenthood health centers have condoms, can diagnose and treat herpes, offer patient education on herpes symptoms and transmission, and can help you decide if herpes medications are right for you.

So an even less than 1 in 1,000 chance if one person is on meds?  What’s the big deal then?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 19, 2014 at 11:00 pm  said:    Those numbers are per sex act, so depending on how often a couple has sex, the chances per year would be much higher. The risk might be acceptable to some, unacceptable to others.  Here’s the relevant paragraph from the New England Journal of Medicine:  The median number of sexual contacts per couple during the study was 49 in the valacyclovir group and 46 in the placebo group (range, 0 to 482). The frequency of genital HSV-2 acquisition increased with the reported frequency of sexual activity and was 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of valacyclovir recipients, as compared with 0.68 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of placebo recipients. The respective rates of acquisition among susceptible women were 0.60 and 1.27 per 1000 sexual contacts and, among susceptible men, 0.23 and 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 20, 2014 at 1:03 am  said:    So, take this with a grain of salt, as I haven’t taken my biostats classes yet, but I believe these numbers would translate to a 3.07% chance of a female catching herpes from a male after 52 sex acts (say after a year of having sex once a week on average), while a male would have a 1.19% chance of catching herpes from his female partner after 52 sex acts, assuming the person with herpes was taking valacyclovir.  I used this cheat sheet , where the herpes was represented by 52 lottery tickets. T=1000, W=0.6 or W=0.23, and P=52. Take it with a grain of salt as I’m not a statistician!    Reply ↓           John C. on October 9, 2014 at 7:08 am  said:    Ann,  I believe the cheat sheet you used for your calculations would not  be the proper one to use for this example.  You are also using 52 for sex acts based on once a week.  If you were using this number, your number for W would be much less as .6 and .35 are based on 1000 sex acts.  Based on the numbers from the report, to me at least, its saying that for every 1000 sex acts for women susceptible to HSV-2, .6 women contracted the disease when their partner was on Valtrax while 1.27 women contracted it when their partner was not on Valtrax.  If you put this into a percentage, this means .6/1000 and 1.27/1000 for women and .23/1000 and .35/1000 are the only formulas you would need to use.  If it indeed cuts down viral shedding by up to 94%, that is a major factor in the reduction in transmission.  What the report doesn’t say though, is whether the couples abstained during outbreaks.  Now you add condoms to the mix, and its even lower.  I know people that have been on suppressive therapy for years and have not had any outbreaks during that entire time.  Most people who transmit the disease do not know they have it, therefore they are not taking medication to help control it.  I do believe a cure is on the way for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 as they have now determined what causes Herpes to go into latency in both versions of the disease which makes it impossible to kill.  Once a drug can be created and tested that will bring all herpes cells out of hibernation, it can be killed using the same drugs used for suppressive therapy.  Think of it as one massive outbreak bringing the condition to an end.  Its still a ways off due to lack of funding for clinical trials, but search for Duke University and University of Florida herpes research to learn more about this discovery.

If your girlfriend has an HSV-2 infection in her genital region, it can only be transmitted via contact with her genital region — not by kissing. The herpes virus doesn’t hang out in the blood. (According to Ask Alice , small amounts of virus might enter the bloodstream during the first herpes outbreak. So if your girlfriend has had HSV-2 for a while, you don’t have to worry about even that small possibility.)  According to the Red Cross , people with herpes can donate blood: “Chlamydia, venereal warts (human papilloma virus), or genital herpes are not a cause for deferral if you are feeling healthy and well and meet all other eligibility requirements.”    Reply ↓           karen on July 11, 2015 at 1:41 am  said:    Of the 267 Women 9 got it during the study period.  That suggests in active couple that woman likely have 3% chance of getting it after a sustained time period and sexual encounters.  I’d also suspect the results would be in the double digits if we were talking about a couple where they both didn’t know that one of them has it.  The risk is real over time but not a deal breaker if you think the person is the “one”.  Does suggest not to be too casual and have repeated acts with someone that you don’t deem to have long term relationship potential.  >> Participants A total of 528 monogamous couples discordant for HSV-2 infection, including an HSV-2–susceptible population of 261 men and 267 women.

My partner complained of discomfort after sex with me and when I checked it out a week later I had the virus and a blister on my anus. I felt like my life had ended and was worried because we had broken up and I had sex with a new partner while I was on the last day of my period . After I was diagnosed I was paranoid I had passed the virus to my new partner but I had not. We have been having safe sex whilst I have no symptoms of an outbreak and everything has been gud until now. I was again on my last day of my period and we had unprotected sex in the shower with the water running and within less than 3hours of intercourse my parter started complaining about discomfort. Based on my research it says the virus cannot be passed on via the blood but I am concerned the only time my virus seems to b passing on is during my period.  We are going to the doctor tomorrow and I’m praying that he hasn’t contracted the virus from me .    Reply ↓         Anna C. on December 18, 2015 at 2:19 pm  said:    Herpes can be transmitted even when no symptoms are present, because the virus can be “shed” from your body without symptoms. However, some things can “trigger” the virus, including menstruation . To reduce risk of transmitting the virus to your partner, it’s important to use condoms each and every time, in combination with other risk-reducing strategies like medications (acyclovir).  Good luck, and the doctor should be able to answer your questions. Make sure to write them down first, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting to ask.

Because HSV-2 can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, you can pass the virus to your wife during sex. Condoms will reduce the risk but are limited by how much skin they cover. If she has HSV-1 she has some , but not complete, protection from symptoms of an HSV-2 infection. Has your wife had a blood test for HSV-2? It’s possible she already has it, but never got symptoms. Most people with HSV-1 or HSV-2 don’t get symptoms.    Reply ↓         married couple on December 26, 2015 at 9:56 am  said:    Yes she’s been tested and she is negative.

But probably the best thing to do is to talk to a qualified health care provider for advice on whether you should start using condoms or taking suppressive medication. It also depends on how your wife feels about the possibility of getting HSV-2. Some people are willing to take the risk.

Unfortunately, it’s often impossible to know where an HSV infection came from. It also depends on how you found out about your HSV infection — did you have an outbreak that was confirmed as herpes, or did you have a blood test that showed you had been exposed to HSV? Most people will test positive for HSV-1 on a blood test, but if they don’t have symptoms they can’t know for sure if the infection is located in their facial area, genital area, or both. If you decide to tell your ex-boyfriend, you might find some of these tips helpful.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on February 28, 2016 at 9:00 pm  said:    Suppressive therapy dramatically reduces risk of HSV transmission, and there is less risk of transmission when symptoms are not present, but it is still possible to transmit HSV even when you have no symptoms and are on anti-herpes medications. Someone with an HSV-1 infection in the genitals might not have as severe symptoms if later infected in the genitals with HSV-2, though it is possible to be infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the same part of the body. You and your wife will have to decide what level of risk you’re OK with, and might want to talk to a knowledgeable doctor to get all of your questions answered. Good luck!

You would need to ask your health-care provider to look at your medical records to answer your specific questions, but most STD screening does not include blood tests for herpes, so it’s possible you hadn’t been tested until now. Also, since most people get HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) in childhood, most of us will test positive for it.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on April 1, 2016 at 3:10 pm  said:    Whether to disclose herpes status is a question that a lot of people have when first learning of their diagnosis, especially when they learn how common herpes is despite being stigmatized. People can reduce risk of transmitting the virus to a partner by taking FDA-approved herpes medications such as acyclovir, which decreases the amount of virus that a person can “shed” from their body. While this type of medication can be used along with other risk-reducing methods, like abstinence during outbreaks and condoms or dental dams during other sexual contact, it does not reduce the risk to zero.  However, healthy relationships are built on trust, and talking about HIV/STD status is an important conversation for people to have when first getting together. It might be a difficult conversation, but it’s an important one for all sexually active people to learn to do, regardless of their own HIV/STD status. It is a time to talk about health, boundaries, and what activities you’re into. Disclosing your status can be one part of a larger, and very important, conversation that can help form the foundation of a healthy relationship.

But just because there are no symptoms doesn’t mean you’re not shedding — that can happen with no symptoms at all.  The best way to avoid transmission is to practice abstinence during outbreaks (until a week after sores have healed), to take anti-herpes medications, and to use condoms. Communication is also important. Your guy can decide for himself what risks he is comfortable taking, and he can also get a blood test (if he hasn’t already) to find out if he is already a carrier for either type of herpes. Most people have HSV-1, and HSV-2 is also very common, though the vast majority of people who have it don’t know it, because they never have symptoms.  Please don’t feel disgusting! You are not defined by the viruses in your cells. Everyone has viruses — they are a fact of life — but society chooses to view certain viruses as taboo. It is so unfortunate that so many of us are made to feel shame for our STD status. Shame doesn’t help anyone. Good luck!

It’s a good question, but I’m unaware of any studies on using acyclovir to prevent HSV acquisition in people who don’t have the virus. Using Google, I found this webpage , which says that no research has been performed to answer this question (I’ve never heard of that website and don’t necessarily endorse it). Using PubMed, I wasn’t able to find any article addressing the question either. I did find an article assessing the effectiveness of a different drug (not acyclovir) in protecting HSV-negative people from acquiring the virus — while it had encouraging results, I don’t think this drug has been well-studied as pre-exposure prophylaxis either, but it’s worth a closer look.  The thing is, you would need a doctor to prescribe the acyclovir, and if you’re negative for HSV-2 or don’t have symptoms for HSV-1 (which most people will test positive for), a doctor might not prescribe it — the drawbacks (e.g., cost and side effects) might not be worth the benefits (e.g., avoiding HSV-2 acquisition, which is not a proven benefit). A good thing for sexual partners to do before getting together is to discuss their STD status, and go in for testing together. As I said in my reply to another comment to this post, healthy relationships are built on trust, and having “the talk” about your status is an important conversation to learn how to have. It may be a difficult conversation, but it can serve as an opportunity to talk not just about health, but also about boundaries, likes, dislikes, etc. Good communication is the foundation for healthy relationships, whether they are long-term or short-term.

We had a great talk about it, where she told me and I told her I would love to keep seeing her. But I am so new to this where as I only remember education from school. Protected sex thus far. But what about when she gives me oral sex, how high are risks? And what about sleeping throughout the night with no clothes on and “spoon” as we typically do? What about foreplay like using my hands and such? And last, what about towels that have her bodily fluids on them? Reading this article and the comments and replays have helped tremendously. Sorry if any of these questions are stupid, but I feel the more educated we are the better the relationship.

Even if you broke up with him to “spare” him from getting the virus from you, chances are that his next girlfriend would have the virus that causes cold sores as well. This seems like a decision for him to make on his own. Find some good information on cold sores to share with him so his decision can be informed. Good luck!

HSV-1 is usually associated with cold sores, and most people get it when they’re children, but it can easily be spread to the genitals by oral sex. Since HSV-1 is incredibly common (even in people who never get cold sores), the chances are high that your current husband already has HSV-1. If you tell your husband about your diagnosis, you can make sure to share all the important facts with him — the World Health Organization has an excellent webpage about herpes simplex virus.  If the doctor who diagnosed you with HSV-1 can’t answer your questions, you can make an appointment at a Planned Parenthood health center to talk to someone very well-versed in sexual health. Make sure you write all your questions down so you don’t forget them. Good luck!

Parameters are what we are ultimately seeking to discover in science. If you roll the dice in a specific way from a specific starting position you will always roll a 4. That is better than saying I have a 0.2 percent chance of contacted a disease this week. I know darn well that if there is oozing slime landing in my mouth I am pretty much gonna get infected.  For the love of reality, please give some more details on the virus. I think we all would benefit from more parameters about this virus.I am asking for something more quantitative:  Can you provide average and maximum lifetime of herpes virus in the blood? Can you provide some information on what maximum and minimum temperature will inactive/kill herpes virus and the amount of time required?  I am asking because I am tired of getting information that doesn’t help me. I am represented by parameters not statistics. Parameters represent the reality. Statistics represents everything we can’t fully describe yet but generalizes. In an age when we all want to believe we are exceptional and we all try to consume ourselves into being better than our neighbors can you provide some more scientific details.

Since it is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, condoms are limited by how much skin they can cover. Lambskin condoms are not recommended for STD prevention, as they are porous and can allow viruses through (viruses are smaller than sperm).

I tried them some years back and found them much more sensitive and satisfying than latex. Having said that they are much more fiddling as they do not have a reservoir tip to collect the cum. I have used them sometimes for anal but not every time. Back to latex for me.    Reply ↓           Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

What You Need to Know About Herpes Transmission Medically reviewed by Alana Biggers, MD on  April 13, 2017 — Written by Corey Whelan HSV2 and oral transmission HSV1 and oral transmission Symptoms Prevention Overview  Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) is one of two types of the herpes virus and is rarely transmitted orally. However, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. People with compromised immune systems in particular may be at risk.  HSV2 is a sexually transmitted virus that causes sores and blisters known as herpes lesions. In order to be infected with HSV2, there has to be skin-to-skin contact between an infected person and a partner. HSV2 is not transmitted through semen.  Once HSV2 enters the body, it travels through the nervous system to the spinal nerves, where it typically comes to rest in the sacral ganglia, a cluster of nerve tissue located near the base of the spine. After the initial infection, HSV2 lies dormant in your nerves. When it becomes activated, a process known as viral shedding occurs. Viral shedding is when the virus replicates. Viral shedding may cause a herpes outbreak and symptoms such as herpes lesions. These usually occur in the genitals or rectum. However, it’s also possible for the virus to be activated and for no visible symptoms to occur.  HSV2 can be asymptomatic, which means it causes no apparent symptoms. That’s why it’s important to use protection during sexual activity and to get tested regularly by a doctor if you are sexually active. You can still transmit the virus to a partner even if you don’t have any apparent symptoms.  HSV2 and oral transmission HSV1 and oral
transmission  The other commonly transmitted strain of the herpes simplex virus , HSV1, typically results in oral herpes, or cold sores around the mouth. This form of HSV is more readily transmitted via oral contact, such as kissing, than through genital contact. HSV1 can be transmitted through both giving and receiving oral sex. It can cause both mouth and genital sores. You can also get HSV1 through vaginal and anal intercourse, and through the use of sex toys.  Unlike HSV2, which usually lies dormant between outbreaks at the base of the spine, HSV1’s latency periods are typically spent in nerve endings near the ear. That is why it is more likely to cause oral herpes than genital herpes.  HSV1 and HSV2 are genetically similar to each other. For this reason, having one form of the virus sometimes reduces risk of contracting the other form. This is because your body actively produces antibodies to fight the virus once you have it. However, it is possible to contract both forms.  Symptoms Symptoms to look out
for  HSV1 and HSV2 can both have no symptoms or very mild symptoms that you might not notice. Not having symptoms does not mean you do not have the virus.  If you do have symptoms of HSV1, they may include:  a tingling sensation, itching, or pain, anywhere in the genital area or around the mouth one or more small, white blisters that may become oozy, or bloody one or more small, red bumps or irritated-looking skin  It is important to see a doctor if you suspect you have contracted HSV1 or HSV2. There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications can help reduce the number and severity of your outbreaks.  Prevention How to prevent HSV transmission  HSV2 can often be prevented with some proactive strategies. These include:  Prevention tips Always use a condom during any type of sexual activity. Avoid having sex during herpes outbreaks, but be aware that people with herpes may have no symptoms and still transmit the virus. Maintain a mutually monogamous relationship with an infection-free person. Communicate with your sexual partner or partners if you have HSV, and ask if they have it themselves. Abstaining from all forms of sexual activity or reducing the number of sexual partners you have also reduces risk.

What's a Cold Sore? What Causes a Cold Sore? How Do Cold Sores Spread? How Are Cold Sores Diagnosed and Treated?     Print en español Herpes labial Neal knew something weird was going on. A few days before, his lip started tingling and felt a little numb. He didn't pay much attention to it then, but now there was a certain throbbing something on his lip and it wasn't pretty. At first Neal thought it was a zit because it was red and tender, but then it blistered and opened up. Neal had a cold sore.      Maybe you've heard of a fever blister — a cold sore is the same thing. They're pretty common and lots of people get them. So what exactly are cold sores and what causes them?  What's a Cold Sore?  Cold sores, which are small and somewhat painful blisters that usually show up on or around a person's lips, are caused by herpes simplex virus-1  (HSV-1) . But they don't just show up on the lips. They can sometimes be inside the mouth, on the face, or even inside or on the nose. These places are the most common, but sores can appear anywhere on the body, including the genital area.  Genital herpes isn't typically caused by HSV-1; it's caused by another type of the herpes simplex virus called herpes simplex virus-2  (HSV-2) and is spread by sexual contact. But even though HSV-1 typically causes sores around the mouth and HSV-2 causes genital sores, these viruses can cause sores in either place. What Causes a Cold Sore?  HSV-1 is very common. If you have it, chances are you picked it up when you were a kid — most likely from direct contact with someone who has it or getting kissed by an adult with the virus.  Although a person who has HSV-1 doesn't always have sores, the virus stays in the body and there's no permanent cure.  When someone gets infected with HSV-1, the virus makes its way through the skin and into a group of nerve cells called a ganglion (pronounced: GANG-glee-in). The virus moves in here, takes a long snooze, and every now and then decides to wake up and cause a cold sore. But not everyone who gets the herpes simplex virus develops cold sores. In some people, the virus stays dormant (asleep) permanently.  What causes the virus to "wake up" or reactivate? No one knows for sure. A person doesn't need to have a cold to get a cold sore. Cold sores can be brought on by other infections, fever, stress, sunlight, cold weather, hormone changes in menstruation or pregnancy, tooth extractions, and certain foods and drugs. In a lot of people, the cause is unpredictable.  Here's how a cold sore develops:   The herpes simplex virus-1, which has been lying dormant in the body, reactivates or "wakes up."  The virus travels toward the area that was originally infected (like a person's lip) via the nerve endings.  The area below the skin's surface, where the cold sore is going to appear, starts to tingle, itch, or burn.  A red bump appears in the area about a day or so after the tingling.  The bump becomes a blister.  The blister dries up and a yellow crust appears in its place.  The scab-like yellow crust falls off and leaves behind a pinkish area where it once was.  The herpes simplex virus travels back to the ganglion (nerve cells), where it goes back to "sleep."  How Do Cold Sores Spread?  Cold sores are really  contagious . If you have a cold sore, it's very easy to infect another person with HSV-1. The virus spreads through  direct_contact — through skin contact or contact with oral or genital secretions (like through kissing). Although the virus is most contagious when a sore is present, it can still be passed on even if you can't see a sore. HSV-1 can also be spread by sharing a cup, eating utensils, or lip balm or lipstick with someone who has it.  In addition, if you or your partner gets cold sores on the mouth, the herpes simplex virus-1 can be transmitted during oral sex and cause herpes in the genital area.  Herpes simplex virus-1 also can spread if a person touches the cold sore and then touches a  mucous_membrane or an area of the skin with a cut on it. So it's best to not mess with a cold sore — don't pick, pinch, or squeeze it.  Actually, it's a good idea to not even touch active cold sores. If you do touch an active cold sore, don't touch other parts of your body. Wash your hands as soon as possible.  Be especially careful not to touch your eyes. If HSV-1 gets into the eyes, it can cause a lot of damage. In fact, if you have a cold sore or you're around someone with a cold sore, try to wash your hands often.  Cold sores can be dangerous for people whose immune systems are weakened (such as infants and people who have cancer or HIV/AIDS ) as well as those with eczema . For people with any of these conditions, an infection triggered by a cold sore can even be life threatening.  How Are Cold Sores Diagnosed and Treated?  Cold sores normally go away on their own within 7 to 10 days. Although no medicines can make the infection go away, special prescription medicines and creams can shorten the length of an outbreak and make the cold sore less painful.  If you have a cold sore, it's important to see your doctor if:   you have another health condition that has weakened your immune system  the sores don't heal by themselves within 7 to 10 days  you get cold sores often  you have signs of a bacterial infection, such as fever, pus, or spreading redness   To make yourself more comfortable when you have a cold sore, you can apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel or anything cool to the area. You also can take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Reviewed by: Mary L.

Aikea        December 2013    edited December 2013   in Herpes question(s)      Hi there I'm completely new here. Was feeling really down after being single for the first time while having this. Reading the information on here has made me feel so much more positive about this. So thank you so much everyone. My question is.. If its a 4% chance for a male to catch this with unprotected sex with a herpes + person then what is the percentage of anybody catching it from anyone? And same with using a condom..? Hope that makes sense.       Comments          adrial        December 2013       Hi Aikea! Welcome to the Herpes Opportunity forums! Good to have you. All the percentages of passing herpes are gone over in detail on this handout here: http://bit.ly/h-opp-disclosure-handout The reason there is 2.5x greater chances of females getting herpes than for males is because a vagina has more mucous membrane than a penis. It's easier to transmit herpes when there is easier access to the person's body since herpes is passed from skin-to-skin contact. Mucous membrane is way more permeable to the virus than the skin.

Download your free e-book & handouts now .         Aikea        December 2013       Thanks for the reply Adrial. Sorry I wasn't very clear.. I meant what is the chance of the average person catching herpes in general - say from someone who didn't know they had it etc. I mean like if someone went out and had a one night stand.              adrial        December 2013    edited December 2013       I'm still unclear on your question.  Did you have a one night stand and are worrying that you might have passed herpes to him? What your asking would still carry the same percentages that are on that handout whether it's sex via one night stand or in a relationship or if the person knows they have it or not. I do believe the chances of passing herpes drops considerably when you know your body well because you can avoid sex during herpes outbreaks and when you feel an outbreak might be coming on. But as far as when there isn't an active outbreak, the percentages break down to what's on that handout. Those percentages are aggregates of all the people who have gotten herpes vs all the people who haven't. They're averages. You can't quite say to someone "You're going to get 4% herpes." Either they're going to get herpes or not, but the chances of them getting herpes are much smaller than the chances of them getting herpes, especially when you take basic precautions and are safe and knowledgeable about your prodrome symptoms. Was that more clear?              Aikea        December 2013       Lol ok hmm... What I think I mean is. What is the chance/percentage of anyone catching herpes?               adrial        December 2013    edited December 2013       Have you ever seen the "Who's on first?" sketch? I feel like that's what we're playing now.  To answer your question directly: It depends. The chance of anyone catching herpes depends on if they are a man/woman, whether the person with herpes knows they have herpes or not, whether a condom is used or not, whether suppressive medication is used or not and other factors. The full range in all of that falls between roughly a 1-10% chance of anyone catching herpes at any given time.              WCSDancer2010        December 2013       I would add that a lowered immune system and rough sex (which could cause small tears to form an make it easier for the virus to get in) would put the numbers at the higher end too.

Your right thats us Thanks for answering my questions And answers to questions I didnt ask! By the way I just disclosed and he was really lovely about it.   Whew!              WCSDancer2010        January 2014       YAY Aikea! Another success story               abc123        January 2014       Love the "Who's On First" reference....thanks for asking/answering these questions... And making it funny, too!              Mermaid2349        January 2014       WCSDancer2010, I apologize in advance for hijacking this post, but something you said was exactly what I came to the forum today looking for. Just disclosed, and like Aikea he was great about everything. My question is this, he takes medication that has the side effect of lowering his immune system. And I am wondering what that means in terms of risks to him. I do not want to proceed without doing a bit of research, asking my doctor and the folks on here (who are a lot more knowledgeable than a lot of MD's about the topic) so that he can make an informed choice. I want to keep him safe and herpes free!!! Thanks everyone! Mermaid2349              WCSDancer2010        January 2014       Well, I'm not a doctor so I can't really advise on that. Really, he should talk to HIS doctor about what his risks are. There are many reasons people are on those drugs and some might be more likely to have issues with getting Herpes than others. All we can tell you here is with supressant meds and a condom you can get his risks down to no more than 2% .... and really, I think if you are really, really in tune with your body, perhaps more..... The GOOD thing is that you will have a great excuse to find all kinds of wonderful ways to pleasure each other when you *might* be having an OB that you might not explore otherwise.

I'm new and it has helped a lot. I'm a physicist who now works in infectious disease research (irony!), and one thing I've been reading about is the single-exposure probability calculation present in many posts, most comprehensively here . Though they get to the right answer eventually, I'd like to try my shot at consolidating and simplifying the problem. I think the clear take away from all the analysis is that you can feel comfortable stating the following - anything more or less is over or understating it: "The chances of transmitting genital herpes (HSV2) from a single sex act is much lower than 1%." PLEASE do not state anything more than this. I'll do the calculations below, and they will shock you. But please resist the temptation to cite the actual results that arise from them. I'll go into details at the end. I think the more pedagogical way to do this is to assume the transmission rate is 1% and prove it is wrong ("rejecting the null hypothesis"). This is equivalent to saying we have a 100-sided die, and we roll it twice a week for a year (I assume Friday and Saturday nights!). What are the chances you never roll a 69? The first time you roll it you have a 1 in 100 chance of rolling a 69. The next time you roll it, what are the chances of rolling a 69? You guessed it - 1 in 100. You can say this because each roll is an independent event (a huge assumption that we will discuss later and I believe the reason why health professionals don't share these calculations). During the two rolls, how many total combinations of rolls could we have had? We have 100 possibilities for the first roll and 100 for the second, so the total number of combinations is 100*100 = 10,000. How many of them have at least one 69 in them? Well, if we first roll a 69 then it doesn't matter what we roll next - all one hundred possibilities will give us a case in which there was at least one 69 rolled. Conversely, if we roll a 69 on the second roll, it didn't matter what we rolled in the first roll. Thus the probability is 200/10,000 = 1/50. (Yes, we did double-count the case in which you roll two 69s, so the true probability is 199/10,000). An easier way to do this is to ask, what is the probability of rolling no 69s in two rolls. There is a 99 in 100 chance, per roll, that you will not roll a 69. So the probability of not rolling any 69s in two rolls is the chance of not rolling it in the first roll times the chance of not rolling in the second role, or 99/100 * 99/100 = 9801/10,000 = 0.9801. So you have a 98% chance of not getting a 69 in either of two rolls. How about if you roll this die twice a week for a year? That's 104 times. So the probability of not rolling any 69s in a year is (99/100)^104 = 0.35. What's the probability you will roll at least one 69 in that year? Well, it is 100% minus the probability you will not roll any. 100%-35% = 65%. So let's get back to the H. The calculation I just did states that, if the chances of a single-exposure transmission were 1%, the annual transmission rate would be 65%. But the number from Adrial's handout is 10% for male-to-female transmission with avoidance of outbreaks (Adrial - it is crucial that you change "Unprotected Transmission Rates" to " Annual Unprotected Transmission Rates" in your handout. I'd also add the "sex twice a week" to the "assumes the following" section). So we can do the reverse calculation. What is the per-exposure probability (I'll call this value x ) given the annual transmission rate is 10%? x ^104 = 0.9 This makes x = 0.999. There's a 99.9% chance we won't transmit during a one-night stand. What's the probability of transmission? You guessed it, 1-0.999 = 0.001. There's 0.1% chance of transmitting. Now, we know condoms and suppressive therapy reduces the annual rates, and they are likely multiplicative in their effect. So here are the numbers in that case, using the numbers in Adrial's handout: Male-to-female: Avoid outbreaks only: Annual, 10%, per-exposure, 0.1% Suppressive therapy: 48% reduction. Annual, 5.2%, per-exposure, 0.05% Suppressive therapy + condoms: An additional 30-50% reduction. Annual, 2.6-3.6%, per-exposure 0.03-0.04% Female-to-male: Avoid outbreaks only: Annual, 4%, per-exposure, 0.04% Suppressive therapy: 48% reduction. Annual, 2%, per-exposure, 0.02% Suppressive therapy + condoms: An additional 30-50% reduction. Annual, 1-1.4%, per-exposure 0.01% Why not to cite these exact numbers: Here I assumed every roll is the same. Every die is the same. In the statistics parlance we assumed each roll was "independent and independently distributed." But we know this is not the case with the H. Rough sex may open micro-tears and increase your chances. Your shedding rate varies over time and so each sex act is a roll with a completely different die. People are different and not "independently distributed." So just go with it and tell your partner the chances for tonight are "much less than 1%." Besides, I'm not sure putting on your spectacles, speaking like Urkel, and stating "there is a zero point zero four percent chance I will give you herpes in this encounter" would have the desired effect anyway. (But hey, if that's your thing, run with it. If you are courting a super nerd you may even want to amp it up to "given an aggregate annual transmission rate of 3.6% assuming two sex acts per week, condom use, suppressive therapy, and avoidance of outbreaks, our per-act transmission probability, assuming it is independent and independently distributed, is 3 times 10 to the negative fourth power. The expectation value of the number of sex acts we will have before transmission is 2805.3.") Is this justification to not disclose? There's so much about this on this forum (e.g. here and here ), so I doubt I can add anything new to that subject. I will say it's been 3.5 months since I've had sex - since leaving a lying, cheating girlfriend that I stayed with for 3 months too long because of this stupid disease - and the temptation for me is large. I've had at least three chances to have my "rebound," and this is important because not only do I need to get over the trauma of the H diagnosis, but also the trauma of being so unbelievably deceived, cheated on, and lied to. But have stayed strong and not done it, for I pride myself on being a moral person who struggles to always better myself. Not disclosing would be a betrayal to myself. Another note, I really love @hippyherpy 's thread entitled " The Ladies' Man's Disclosure Success Thread ." It has, at least temporarily, snapped me out of the depression of thinking I'll never have sex again (or at least I have to wait for love to have it again). His work was the real inspiration for me to write this, and to hopefully have my first real disclosure this weekend (besides to the cheating GF who probably had it anyway). We shall see. Well, this was a monster first post. Apologies for the tome - I suppose it was a bit of a catharsis. But thank you all once again, especially Adrial, for creating such a supportive and informative group. If people have questions, concerns, corrections, or comments, I'd love to hear them.       « 1 2 » Comments          janedoe        May 2016    edited May 2016       When I asked the transmission rate per sex act question, I assumed that researchers assume a sex act as a discrete event like you did in your calculations. After some researching I concluded that they just assumed a continious probability distribution (I haven't read journal articles abt H but I am planing to) - that is why they cannot estimate a transmission rate per sex act (I was kind of wrong apparently). Your calculations are to the point (I have a B.S. in Mathematics), and they finally answer my question. Thanks for this. Seeing the calculations made me feel a lot better.       Ace "the Talk"!

WCSDancer2010        May 2016       First off, Thank you @aep001for this ... we actually had a similar reply here from Dr Leone but without all the extended mathematics.. http://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/5255/from-dr-peter-leone-herpes-transmission-risk-per-sex-act-explained  BTW.... this was funny as hell - I kinda wanna make a Meme or a GIF with it...LOL "given an aggregate annual transmission rate of 3.6% assuming two sex acts per week, condom use, suppressive therapy, and avoidance of outbreaks, our per-act transmission probability, assuming it is independent and independently distributed, is 3 times 10 to the negative fourth power. The expectation value of the number of sex acts we will have before transmission is 2805.3." That's HAWT...LOL As for you finding love, you need to read this guy's story... I've watched him through most of his journey and he had quite the ride but what a beautiful ending http://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/3439/tonight-is-my-night Glad to have you aboard               hippyherpy        May 2016    edited May 2016       I'm glad to see my cad ways having some mathematical resonance. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the takeaway here is that compared to Adrial's handout, the risk of giving it to your long term girlfriend over the course of the year is higher (like almost 4% instead of 2%) and the risk of giving it to a one night stand girl is much smaller (.03 % compared to 2%)? It's interesting because the smaller the percent brings disclosure and non-disclosure closer together for the one night stand. At zero percent risk they do come together. What about even longer term than a year. Two years? Three, five, ten, etc.? Does the risk of transmitting to your partner increase as you add more years? Does it bottom out at some point to a percent and not get bigger from there? We talk a lot about the stigma of herpes here, but there is also a stigma of non-disclosure which probably a lot of people are feeling, "I didn't disclose, so therefore I'm going to stay silent" for guilt reasons or fear of litigation. I've had doctors tell me it's ok not to disclose on a one night stand and only if I'm going to get into a relationship. Your math could back that up. The math you present also bolsters disclosure on a one night stand because it really is almost impossible to transmit- to me .03 is getting close to zero. Now all we need is a funny video showing this like the " Adam Ruins Herpes " video. Also some more analogies along the lines of the "car accident" risk but ones that go even further to explain how little the risk is for a one night stand. I deduced a similar number, .02% from the stats I found on line that said it was something like 1/233 chance of passing it.              MMissouri        May 2016        @hippyherpy if you take the disclosure away, where's the challenge in you getting laid? It sounds like it happens pretty frequently even with your H disclosures. It'd just be too easy for you then. Where's the fun in that! LOL              hippyherpy        May 2016       Ha Good question. It's just a different thing now.

Two things: @aep001 suggested that if you want to talk about a "per sex act" number on things to say "less than 1% chance"... HOWEVER - if you are having sex with different women over the course of weeks or months, your risk factor is by all rights, INCREASING that *someone* will be the "unlucky one".... in which case *IF* you happened to give it to someone after sugar coating things with the "less than 1%" concept, there's a good chance she will come back and rip you a new asshole (if not worse) if she sees that the risk to her starts at 10% (before condoms and meds). My point is: PLEASE STOP looking for excuses to not disclose by trying to find a low enough number to justify not telling. Once again, our policy here is always disclose. It's really disconcerting to have you constantly challenging the disclosure issue. There's a thing called INTEGRITY. We believe in that here. If you can't accept that and need to keep challenging this please, find another forum that will tell you what you WANT to hear. Because you won't get it here. Bottom line: every sex act brings a risk... that we pass it on AND that we get something else. Having H (as you have discovered) gives us the excuse to have the STD talk so that (hopefully) our partners will be honest with us about anything they know about (as you have seen with HPV). That alone is a good reason to disclose - not that they will know or even be honest but at least it opens the conversation and may save you a lot of angst some day *if* you happen to get unlucky and pass it on. The more honest you are about the risks, the less comeback anyone would have... just as if you got HPV/warts from a girl who told you she had them 6 months ago and you chose to go ahead anyway. You made an adult choice based on certain knowledge and you couldn't blame her if it happened....but if you didn't know better and she said "you risk is .004%" and you got it, odds are you might not be as accepting of the situation. Please refer to the link I posted above: http://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/5255/from-dr-peter-leone-herpes-transmission-risk-per-sex-act-explained               Allyb1123        May 2016       My ex never disclosed that he had H to me. We were together for two years before he came to me and said he thinks he might have herpes. When we first started dating I told him I had been raped about 6 months prior and I got tested for everything because of that, about a month before I met him. I had been dating someone prior to the rape and we hooked up a few times before I met my ex, the situation was too much for him. So when I was with my ex for about 4 months he was always bringing up things about std's and said his best friend had H. I remember the feeling I had when he told me his friend had it and that he was out there having sex with women and not disclosing it with them. It was truly disgusting to me. Then here we were building our lives together and bam! He tells me that, at first he says you go get tested and hopefully you don't have it, when I came back positive his whole attitude changed he said I have it to him. Then it was well who knows which one gave it to who. But it always came back to me being the one. He knew my past and played it against me and I took it all and desperately tried to make it up to him for the next 3 years as my despise for him grew stronger. He started treating me like his own personal sex slave and I did it because I was already so beat down in life, I thought he was my only happiness, I was wiling to do whatever to make him happy and stay with me. I finally opened my eyes to everything and I left him. He screamed " you gave me herpes!!" I said how do I know you didn't give it to me mf! And he never mentioned it again. I have since spoken to the man I was with prior to him and he said neither him nor his now wife have anything. The whole point being he eithe cheated on me and got this or he had it the whole time and was on suppression therapy and it took two years for it to come out. I let the herpes be a death sentence, like well I guess I'm stuck with a man who treats me like crap! Now I'm trying to heal from all those things I haven't dealt with and its so hard. Single for the first time in 5 years with a std and baggage!! Winner winner right here! I'm trying to figure it out and I'm glad that there is a place like this I can learn and grow in myself and my knowledge of H. The hardest thing for me is the disclosure part. How do I tell someone!? I have went on some dates with people I have really felt a connection with, and I push them away the min sex is either brought up or I feel like I have to push them away because they don't deserve to have herpes. Is this a normal reaction? How to I help stop that train of thought?              hippyherpy        May 2016        WCSDancer2010 said:  hippyherpy said: I'm glad to see my cad ways having some mathematical resonance.

HOWEVER - if you are having sex with different women over the course of weeks or months, your risk factor is by all rights, INCREASING that *someone* will be the "unlucky one".... in which case *IF* you happened to give it to someone after sugar coating things with the "less than 1%" concept, there's a good chance she will come back and rip you a new asshole (if not worse) if she sees that the risk to her starts at 10% (before condoms and meds). My point is: PLEASE STOP looking for excuses to not disclose by trying to find a low enough number to justify not telling. Once again, our policy here is always disclose. It's really disconcerting to have you constantly challenging the disclosure issue. There's a thing called INTEGRITY. We believe in that here. If you can't accept that and need to keep challenging this please, find another forum that will tell you what you WANT to hear. Because you won't get it here. Bottom line: every sex act brings a risk... that we pass it on AND that we get something else. Having H (as you have discovered) gives us the excuse to have the STD talk so that (hopefully) our partners will be honest with us about anything they know about (as you have seen with HPV). That alone is a good reason to disclose - not that they will know or even be honest but at least it opens the conversation and may save you a lot of angst some day *if* you happen to get unlucky and pass it on. The more honest you are about the risks, the less comeback anyone would have... just as if you got HPV/warts from a girl who told you she had them 6 months ago and you chose to go ahead anyway. You made an adult choice based on certain knowledge and you couldn't blame her if it happened....but if you didn't know better and she said "you risk is .004%" and you got it, odds are you might not be as accepting of the situation. Please refer to the link I posted above: http://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/5255/from-dr-peter-leone-herpes-transmission-risk-per-sex-act-explained I'm not looking for excuses to not disclose and have been disclosing to every girl. It's so bad to talk about things? I thought we were all about having open discussions here. I'm interested in why herpes disclosure is so necessary compared to other viruses. It can't hurt to at least be able to discuss this.. if anything this discussion would bolster the disclosure side, as it did for me. It seems as if a few things come into play with disclosure necessity - Risk of transmission - How prevalent the disease is in society - Potential harm of virus for giver and receiver If the risk of transmission drops down to a significant number like .004%, and the prevalence of the virus in society goes up to as much HSV1 oral or HPV, and the potential harm of herpes is actually lower than HPV or some of the other viruses, it does make the question of why we have to disclose worthy of discussion. Also, I don't sugar coat anything. I tell the girls I have herpes. I tell them I take pills and we use condoms and that's not 10% risk. This thread is telling me that the risk is even lower than Adrial's handout. When you start getting into 2% vs. 1% or . 04% that's very low risk in my mind. That's not hiding anything. I don't see how someone could "rip a new asshole" if you've disclosed. Once you've disclosed, you've done your part. For me, I give more info because I think the info actually works in my favor and it's good for people to be educated, but I don't think people are even obligated to anything like that so long as they disclose. I don't believe that a disclosure without providing some info will have a high likelyhood of a "success" The handout says 2% risk of transmission, this thread says less than one percent. I wouldn't go around saying .04% or whatever because I don't think has meaning for most people.              janedoe        May 2016        @hippyherpy The calculations assume iid. which is the same as rolling the same dice everytime. But when you have sex, you are NOT rolling the same dice... You might be shedding virus more on some days, other person might have a tear in his/her genitals, you might have rough sex, your immune system or your partner's immune system might be down when you are having sex... All these possibilities bumps up the transmission rate. So let's say your t.r is 0.04% but tomorrow it might be 1% etc. So, 1% transmission rate is sort of like an upper limit. It might be a good idea to disclose that upper limit.       Ace "the Talk"!

And these are the days that I don't have symptoms?              WCSDancer2010        May 2016        @hippyherpy You said It's interesting because the smaller the percent brings disclosure and non-disclosure closer together for the one night stand. At zero percent risk they do come together. That sounds a lot to me like you are still looking for a reason to not disclose. Again, IMO, if you have the HPV strains for genital warts or cancer, you should disclose ... at least if you are within the 2 yr post "all clear" point when (as *I* understand it) it's safe to consider that it's either gone dormant or disappeared (last I checked there are are still conflicting info on this). As for the other 36 strains - they seem to be harmless AND only we women will know that we have them ... you guys get off the hook on all the HPV except warts as far as knowing what you have (unless you get it in your throat... but that seems to be later in life and they don't seem to think it's important enough to swab you guys for it). So not sure what good it would do to disclose about them. Herpes doesn't affect most people badly... but it DOES affect a small amount of the population and a small number of those people get some pretty rough symptoms. THAT is why we disclose.... for the (my guesstimate) 1% of the population that bets the nerve pain, constant OB's, or other longer term symptoms. We don't know which partner may get symptoms like that. Or if they will get any at all. If you had had a really rough ride with this I bet your POV would be different. But you guys mostly don't get it that bad and the few who do still don't have the kind of folds and areas we have (unless, perhaps, you are uncircumcised) to create the immensely painful sores we women can get. I got a bad OB once when I was planning the last weeks of my wedding. Had to sit on a plane for a few hours. You have NO IDEA of the pain of having a crusted over scab sticking to your underwear and rubbing every time you move. Back then I didn't have access to Valtrex. I was hardly able to move for a week without wanting to cry. THAT is why I'm so adamant about disclosure. I got H on my first sexual experience and in THAT instance, if I had known that guy had H, I probably wouldn't have had sex with him because I really did it to get it over with and see what it was like. Now, knowing what I know now, I would proceed with caution with a partner.... use condoms and such... and for *me*, I can only enjoy sex with someone I see some kind of longer term relationship with...so disclosure would make me really look at whether I saw any kind of long or even short term future with the person. Yes - we are here to discuss things but one thing that we are adamant about is our POV that people should disclose about Herpes. If you want to discuss whether people should disclose about HPV perhaps you should join a forum for that and put in your 10 cents worth..... And I think it's a great thing that people who like the casual sex lifestyle can see that you CAN still find plenty of partners with disclosure. So I appreciate what you bring to us with regards to that discussion. We are not going to change our stance on disclosure here, no matter what stats you come up with. We can't TELL you what to do... but we don't want people to start looking for every excuse to not disclose.... there's a thing called INTEGRITY and we value that here. For that 1% who, like myself, *might* have a tough start with H. hippyherpy said: Let me get this straight, if I have sex 365 days out of the year, don't take meds or use condoms, then about 36 of those days I will give my partner herpes? And these are the days that I don't have symptoms? Again... there's no way to know YOUR shedding rates... and the 10% for women is our RISK .. **Shedding Rates for GHSV2** are 15-30% of the time ... which can be for 1 hr or sustained for days at a time. Rough sex, illness, certain foods, stress, etc can take you from hardly shedding at all to shedding a whole lot for days or weeks at a time. And those are likely the days you don't have symptoms. The CDC says *most people* get HSV from someone who doesn't have symptoms and likely doesn't even know they have H. So to answer your question - it's not that you WILL give your partner H 36 days of the year ... but 15-30% OF THE TIME there's a **higher risk** of you shedding enough to POTENTIALLY pass it to your partner. And again, go read the Dr Leone link ... none of the Dr's that I know who are specialists in the H world support any kind of "per act" stats ... because, as @janedoe said, YOU don't know when you might be shedding heavily asymptomatically ... and stats are only useful in this kind of thing (ie: per act) if you can exactly replicate the data. Because of the variability of the issues of shedding, micro-tears, the other person's immune issues, etc, you CAN'T go on a per-act stat.               hippyherpy        May 2016       Sorry to eat about your outbreak. I definitely do disclose, as you can see in that other thread. Knowing that the risk of transmission is lower than I thought only gives me more confidence in disclosing that I'm less likely to pass it on, not that I wouldn't disclose. Even when I'm buzzed I disclose. It's been baked into my ways at this point.              Katidid        May 2016    edited May 2016       I think often times, we are so inquisitive about the "per sex act" rate of transmission  because we want to keep our partners more safe and have better stats to share with them (and to feel better ourselves about having herpies to begin with)  rather than hoping to not have to disclose. Disclosing, in my opinion,  (thankfully I've only had to do it twice and both were successful) is a very personal choice and it's equally the responsibility of the "other" person to ask....after all, its a shared partership even if for a one night stand. It's all very tricky anyway...... the "other" person may even have it and not know all the while they are asking if you are STD free...or they knowingly  have cold sores and don't give that a second thought!  Really, it's a small wonder it's not 1 out of every 2 people have this.

Really, it's a small wonder it's not 1 out of every 2 people have this. Totally agree that it's a 2 way thing but sadly *we* are the ones in the know. We were likely "that person" on the other side that should have asked the other person about their status. (I know *I* was! LOL ) Because we are here, discussing this, getting educated, we now know better. So *more* of the burden, IMO, is on us to start the conversation... both because we know AND because we need to know how educated they are and whether THEY are a risk for *us* to get involved with. I briefly dated a guy who just could not get in his head that he couldn't "tell" if a person carried an STD.... he was convinced he would "know" by how they acted, or that he would see/smell something that would tell him they were not "safe". The concept of silent carriers (of HPV/Herpes/Aids/etc) just wouldn't enter his head. We parted before things got too sexual but I wouldn't have got into a relationship with him without him getting a test simply because I felt that odds were he had likely been exposed to at least 1 STD along the way....LOL       Ace "the Talk"! Download your free e-book & handouts now .         janedoe        May 2016        @WCSDancer2010 I was like him before my diagnosis. When I had my first OB, I went to the doctor just to ease my mind and get some medication for the itching... I could never have suspected that those paper cut things were herpes... anyway the second guy that I disclosed to is the same. I think that is because of those google images. They are kind of extreme, it makes you think that if I had those, I would know.              hippyherpy        May 2016       It doesn't have to be "sad" and you don't have to be thankful that you've only had to disclose a couple of times. In my experience, the disclosure is not any where as scary or bad as people might think. I think it has it's own kind of stigma in that sense. The rejections aren't that bad either. If the person doesn't like it, then you move on to someone else. I've had many more successes with disclosure than rejections so far. What I'm saying is that, in general, having herpes isn't a big deal, and neither is disclosing. It's just something you do. It doesn't have to be this big dramatic event.              aep001        May 2016       Sorry for my absence. It has been a wild ride since my last post. I did my first real disclosure on Friday night - third date, girl takes me back to her place and jumps on me. Thanks to @hippyherpy and his ladies man's posts, I assumed it would go fine. I stated things in total confidence, and was in an Uber, crushed, within the hour. I've been pretty depressed ever since. I shall rise again, but not yet. But that is a post for a different forum. I have also been chewed out by an epidemiologist I work with, after a few-hours long conversation that recapitulates much of what is on this thread. It was dangerous for me to do the per-exposure calculation because people will just take that with them (even though I warn them not to), and use it as an excuse to not disclose. On the other hand, I saw it as a chance to try to answer a question everyone was asking, and maybe teach people some probability theory along the way. The take away from this post and my other conversation is, however, that the per-exposure risk can swing drastically. It can be orders of magnitude more or less depending on the person - their diet, immune system, random chance, etc. I thought the "much less than 1%" number balanced those things, and I stand by that, but we should all realize that for any given particular act the odds can be much higher than 1% . So why am I still comfortable telling a girl the chances are much lower than 1% (if I ever have the chance again )? Because life is probabilistic. Whenever you do anything you run the risk of getting hurt, and in our minds we call make the calculation of risk vs. reward. But we should know that those aggregate risks (e.g. 0.04% of transmission, or 0.01% chance of dying in a car crash ) are indeed aggregate. There will be times when the risks are much greater and you just don't know. All we can do is disclose as much of the known risk as we can, hope that others understand the risks and how they are aggregate, and go about living our lives. In this case, by saying the risk is "much less than 1%" (maybe we should take out "much"), we are actually multiplying the aggregate risk by 25. So I think that is safe and cautious to our partners, but would love to hear others' thoughts. I think everyone has struggled with the disclosure question. Goodness knows, all I need is a rebound right now so I can move on instead of thinking about how my cheating ex-GF is doing fine and in a relationship, and that has proven difficult. If I had just not disclosed Friday night my life would be so much better and the girl would probably never have known. But at the end of the day I want to be able to call myself a good person, an honest, open, and moral person. And that oftentimes requires courage, perseverance, and sacrifice. @hippyherpy's successes hearten me that the sacrifice will not be too severe, that one can have his cake (sex) and eat it too (the peace that comes with disclosure). We shall see.              aep001        May 2016        hippyherpy said: What about even longer term than a year. Two years? Three, five, ten, etc.? Does the risk of transmitting to your partner increase as you add more years? Does it bottom out at some point to a percent and not get bigger from there? To answer this let's stay away from the per-act conversation and rely on the more reputable annual numbers. If there is a 10% chance of giving someone herpes in a year, what's the chance of not giving it to them in a year? 90%. In two years what's the chance of not giving it to them? 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. Thus the chances of giving someone herpes in two years is 19%, again assuming sex twice a week. To get geeky, the % transmission is: T = 1-(Q^N) Where Q is the chance of *not* transmitting in a year (1-the annual chance of transmission), and T is the overall chance of transmission in N years. If you were to draw that it would be a curve that is always increasing ("monotonic upward"), but with the slope decreasing ("negative concavity"). It "asymptotically" reaches 100%, that is, there is never a 100% chance of giving your partner herpes, unless you live (and have sex with them) forever. However, there is a 99% chance you will give it to them in 44 years (N = log(1-T)/log(Q), Q=90%). Yes, I am not using the continuous distribution calculations, but I don't think there will be a large difference here. I'm happy to re-work all the numbers if people can tell what distribution they used (Poisson?). So, using the numbers in my original post here are the 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year probabilities: Male-to-female: Avoid outbreaks only: 10%, 19%, 41%, 65% Suppressive therapy: 5%, 10%, 23%, 41% Suppressive therapy + condoms: 3-4%, 5-7%, 12-17%, 23-31% Female-to-male: Avoid outbreaks only: 4%, 8%, 18%, 34% Suppressive therapy: 2%, 4%, 10%, 18% Suppressive therapy + condoms: 1%, 2-3%, 5-7%, 10-13%              Bambina3        May 2016    edited May 2016       I'm just reading this and shaking my head....for me personally, when I leave work, that's where I like to leave my brain (lol) So to chime in and simplify, the transmission risk is so minimal that I sit here and think "why me??" I'm on to read next thread              hippyherpy        May 2016    edited May 2016       Yeah but Bambina I also know people who have been married for over thirty years with HSV2 in one partner, having unprotected sex with the spouse and not transmitting. I'm curious about the stats on thus forum membership. Shouldn't a place like this have many more members if herpes was such a common and debilitating virus? Wouldn't there be many more Ella Dawsons jumping in the herpes as identity politics bandwagon? Or do we represent the worst of the worst with regards to symptoms? I haven't had bad symptoms yet, but some people on here give horror stories.               hippyherpy        May 2016       aep001- you got to just move on to the next opportunity and yes there will be rejection and I had that feeling of "it could be so easy to not disclose" when I've gotten rejected, but my success rate dwarfs my rejection rate. The thing is, if you are talking to a lot of women simultaneously, any kind of rejection that one gives you won't matter at as much because there are others to mingle with. That's the closest I'm getting to math here with the physics genius posting hahah Having herpes will probably force you to improve your game even more, which can only be a good thing for you. Also, to keep things in perspective, there are so many other reasons why people get rejected that I don't consider herpes some special reason. This week I slept with two new sexy girls, and I also had two other previous lovers contact me to hang. All were disclosed to. What I'm saying is that is definitely possible to live the life. You have to make some mental adjustments at first, but it is definitely possible. I can tell you that when I started that thread, I didn't know what to expect. I did have a boost of confidence when I first got diagnosed because I had two of my lovers at the time who I told about it still sleep with me. One of them even went raw. That plus the mindset that I'm not going to let some fucking cold sores get in the way of me doing my thing, and that I saw it as a point of pride to prove to myself and to the world that it can be done- casual sex and disclosure are a very real and possible. I still get rejected but I want you to use and piggy back off my successes to keep your confidence. The self improvement opportunity that herpes presents is tremendous. I suggest everyone on this forum who is interested in having sex and disclosing do what they can to do to present the best possible versions of themselves to potential lovers.               janedoe        May 2016    edited May 2016        @hippyherpy I don't think people here represent the worst case scenerio. I figured so many people are ashamed and afraid abt this. That is why there are people here who don't post. Also, people in long term committed relationships may not have the urge to post here. So, this leaves us with newbies and the people who still trying to figure out this stuff. I'd like to do what Ella did but sadly, my days here are limited and my country is not some place that you can have STI talk openly without getting murdered or else... Maybe later in my life, when I finish my PhD, I will try that.               hippyherpy        May 2016       Wow that is intense. I wish you the best of luck dealing with that situation Jane. You are probably right about the reasons for this place being a smallish community.              MMissouri        May 2016       In regards to our members, you have to remember that most people don't even know they have it. If H were included in the STD panel, I'm sure our numbers would increase in accordance. @aep001 I don't think that people took this post as a way to get out of disclosure. And if they did, odds are they weren't going to disclose to begin with. I'm sorry your date didn't end as you hoped. Hang in there!

Or do we represent the worst of the worst with regards to symptoms? I haven't had bad symptoms yet, but some people on here give horror stories. 1) 80% of people with H don't know they have it...so why would they be here. 2) Out of the 20% who know they have H, there is a HUGE difference in experiences. Some got diagnosed and have never had an OB. While some have ongoing and unrelenting symptoms. 3) Whether they have no symptoms or "bad" symptoms, HOW they experience things is a very individual thing. So someone with no symptoms may be totally freaked out while someone with "bad" symptoms may just look up "How do I deal with Herpes", get lots of info, and go on a self-led journey. 4) And to be honest, many get some kind of info from their Dr, go home, just accept their fate (in a positive OR negative way) and never look for outside help often because of the misconception that they are alone in this, or they deserved it, or whatever. 5) Last time I talked to @Adrial about this, which was last year I think, we were getting over 50 THOUSAND hits here EVERY MONTH. So we DO reach a LOT of people. The vast majority never post and just lurk. I expect that number is larger now but that's the last number *I* have. 6) We are not the only resource/forum out there. Our style isn't for everyone. So people will go where they find the information and support that works for them. This is the problem with "statistics" ... if you only know one part of the equation, it's easy to make assumptions. We will never know how far our reach is because people may print out the handouts and give them to a friend who just got diagnosed, or to a potential partner and they may never come here. What I DO know is that this site has one of the largest impacts of any info/support group out there. As for more "Ella Dawsons"? Well, there ARE a number of us out there. Most of us are not *quite* as public as she is and she is only that public because she was kinda forced there by a single article that she wrote and that she didn't realize would make such a huge impact on her as well as the H community. It certainly wasn't her intention to go screaming into the limelight that fast               WCSDancer2010        May 2016        @aep001 Here's how I look at your "unsuccessful" disclosure. I think it was a HUGE success. First - you did it. Like most things in life, the first time is the hardest. So - pat yourself on the back. You did it. You stayed in your integrity. It just didn't end the way you wanted it to. Second... I tell women this, but it generally applies to men too: Odds are she was more interested in getting INTO you than getting into YOU. And at 3 dates, disclosure can go either way...the other person isn't invested in you or the relationship. Their hormones are raging but their head may not be in the equation until you disclose at which time if they are not into YOU... if they don't realize what an AMAZING, WONDERFUL potential partner you are, they may well ditch. I'm slowly learning that if I want a "longer term" relationship (ie, not a one night stand) that having sex early is a double edged sword. My desires may be dealt with at the moment, but I have often had sex *knowing* in the back of my mind that odds are this person isn't right for me, or the tables are reversed and *they* suddenly realize they don't see a LTR with me. And then it gets messy and someone gets hurt. Now, I know you are looking to "rebound". I beg you - don't. It's really not fair to do that to a woman when you are still raw and likely going to get in it, then realize you are not ready, and then bolt. Take it from someone who has been the "rebound chick" ... twice. IT SUCKS. They both went from crazy about me to disappearing when their reality kicked their ass and they found themselves still not complete about the past relationship. Fucking someone won't get you over your ex. Promise. You need to work on letting go of how you believe things "should" be. She's moved on... and it's up to you to move on as well. Read the Success Stories on here ... not just HH, but the ones who were like you, who were picking the wrong partners, and who will say they realize now that THEY were PICKING the wrong person before and H has helped them to make better choices so that they find love like they never knew was possible .... I think you need to see the perspectives of people who have found success finding RELATIONSHIPS with H as well... and not just one night stands. (((HUGS)))              hippyherpy        May 2016    edited May 2016       ^Those are good points. I think it's interesting that now we live in a time when there is a lot of emphasis placed on the importance of the experience of hanging out with someone (the "getting into") instead of the "you" part (like what you describe). For many people, relationships are just a thrill ride of sorts, or a form of an entertainment, like watching a movie but being part of it. We live in a time when the things that used to hold relationships together are starting to slide or lose their meaning. That said, it's more of a reason not to take rejections personally. It's not that they are rejecting "you" per se, but the experience that you might be offering them or that they are having. You are just the person who takes the admission ticket at the gate to the rollercoaster- the messenger. If you want to get more riders, then you can change the roller coaster. Herpes is another part of that ride now. That's why I say it's good to maximize any other aspects of who you are, or to at least clean up any loose ends to your presentation that might have been neglected before. Give the other person the clearest picture possible of who you are. Make it as easy as possible for them to get your vibe.               Bambina3        May 2016       Touching one life....is worth it, so the number  participating on this site is not a factor to me.         « 1 2 »   Sign In or Register to comment.

That said, the following article says that a study was done and the results showed that combining daily Valtrex with condoms resulted in a transmission rate of .04% I think this is pretty significant to the disclosure discussion. What this means is that there is probably a greater chance that the girl who's out looking to hook up that night will get herpes from some other guy she might have met at the bar who wasn't aware that he had it (1 out 4 people in my area have it, so that's probably something like 1/8 males, and 80% of them don't know they have it so they wouldn't be on Valtrex) than from someone who is taking Valtrex every day, using condoms for vaginal sex, and avoiding sex during breakouts. Can we really say that it would be reckless not to disclose with a .04 transmission possibility? Wouldn't I actually be doing her a favor by taking her "off the market" that night from potential partners who don't know they have it? Isn't she taking some responsibility from the get go by hooking up with "random" guys. Let's be honest, girls do that a lot these days in our current Tinder/hook-up culture. A few other questions: what about raw sex or blow jobs? Are they totally out of the question or does Valtrex allow them to be in the equation? Also, is it really necessary to see an Infectious Disease specialist after you get diagnosed? I think there is way too much stigma surrounding genital herpes. It's straight up nonsense that oral heroes people don't "have to" disclose but genital HSV people do. There is so much stigma that I'm not sure that disclosure is always the best way to think about moving forward with ones sex life because trying to explain all of this is probably not going to make sense on a one night stand.. consider that so many people are misinformed about the risks of getting it and how "bad" it is (it's not HIV but it gets treated in our culture as a social death sentence regardless). If you are taking the best precautions than why not just go about doing your thing? You aren't hooking up during breakouts. You are taking the daily supressive therapy and using condoms. The people who are out there who are living the hook up lifestyle are probably going to get it sooner or later anyway- I know because I'm one of them. Here is the article I mentioned: http://www.herpes.org/protecting-uninfected-partners/ The 2004 publication of the results of a major scientific study on genital herpes has given new hope to couples in which one partner has herpes and the other does not. In January, 2004, in the New England Journal of Medicine, the results of a multicenter, randomized, clinical trial was published. This landmark study has offered new hope to these “discordant” couples, in which person has genital herpes and the other does not. It is known that partners infected with genital herpes can transmit the infection to an uninfected partner BOTH when symptoms are present (such as redness and blisters) as well as when no symptoms are present (called “asymptomatic shedding”; see the paper on Asymptomatic Shedding at www.herpes.org ). Researchers have shown that viral shedding of herpes virus occurs very often from the genitals of the infected partner even when the infected partner has no symptoms: In some cases over 80% of the time. This means that an infected partner can transmit herpes to the uninfected partner even when no symptoms are present. Wald et al, as well as other authors, have previously described on many occasions that the use of an antiviral compound such as Valtrex or acyclovir promptly decreased the incidence of viral shedding, reducing the shedding by over 80% in many cases. This profound reduction of viral particles was so significant that it made sense to do a research study to see if, indeed, that fewer uninfected partners became infected when the infected partner took antiviral medication regularly. This important study enrolled 1484 discordant couples (again, “discordant” means that one partner had genital herpes and the other did not). The study ran for eight months. With half of the couples the infected partner took Valtrex, and in the other half the infected partner took placebo. The results were vitally important to discordant couples. The research team found that infections developed in the uninfected partner in only 4 of the 743 couples in which the infected partner took Valtrex, whereas 16 of 741 uninfected partners developed the infection when placebo was taken. This was a reduction in risk to the uninfected partners of about 50%, when the statistics were examined. Viral shedding was reduced by about 70% when Valtrex was taken. Close examination of the data indicates another important point. When partners wore condoms during intimate contact WHILE the infected partner took Valtrex every day, then only a single uninfected partner developed genital herpes. This, I think, is a very important take home point. Discordant couples should discuss whether the infected partner should take antiviral therapy. These results give scientific proof that a discordant couple that approaches intimate contact with care can protect the uninfected partner to a very high degree. As the data prove, the results suggest that the chance of the uninfected partner becoming infected is reduced from 8 incidences per 220 couples that nearly always wore condoms but NO Valtrex (about a 4% chance overall) to 1 incidence in 223 couples that nearly always wore condoms and Valtrex WAS taken daily (about a 0.4% chance). So, if the infected partner takes DAILY Valtrex AND the couple “nearly always” uses condoms, as well as avoiding intimate contact if any symptoms are present, the risk of contracting genital herpes during an eight month period goes from about four chances in a hundred all the way down to 4 chances in a thousand. This is a 90% risk reduction from NOT using medication and NOT using condoms. By the way, Valtrex is the drug that was studied in this case. Would other antivirals work, such as Famvir or generic acyclovir? We do know that viral shedding is also reduced for acyclovir. However, the pharmacokinetics of Valtrex show that it generates a four hundred percent higher level of acyclovir in the bloodstream than does generic acyclovir (Valtrex turns INTO acyclovir once it is absorbed). Thus, it is possible that Valtrex is a superior drug and might have greater protection. This study did not look at the other drugs, and chances are that such a study might not be undertaken, given the enormous cost of conducting this research. Finally, REMEMBER!! This study only looked at people who took the medication every single day during the study. There is NO PROOF that taking a pill right before intercourse – or for a few days before intimate contact – offers ANY protection to the uninfected partner at this time. Perhaps such a study will be done one day, but for now, to offer the best chance to the uninfected partner, then the infected partner must take the medication every day. As with all medical information, persons with herpes infections and their partners should make ALL medical decisions together with an informed and caring physician so that the right care is given. CONCLUSION: This important work sends a very clear message. As Corey et al pointed out in a recent edition of Herpes magazine, “the International Herpes Management Forum (IHMF) now recommends that physicians offer suppressive valaciclovir therapy to immunocompetent individuals concerned about transmitting genital herpes to a heterosexual partner, and advises safer sex behaviour, including the use of condoms, to prevent genital herpes transmission.”2 References        « 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 » Comments          hippyherpy        October 2015       Typo- autocorrect wrote "heroes" where I meant to say herpes.

I have a hunch that all the hysteria surrounding herpes was drummed up by pharmaceutical companies trying to make profit selling drugs for herpes. Why would we want to play into their frame by continuing to make a big deal out of this thing via "disclosure" talks? Just so that they can keep their pockets lined with ridiculously high profit margins? Do we really want want to feed the hype machine?              adrial        October 2015    edited October 2015       Hey hippyherpy. (Great name, by the way).  Welcome! Regardless of how low the % is — our handouts http://eepurl.com/b4IPP are based on the popular numbers — from 1-10% depending on medication and barrier methods. And the fact remains, no one gets 1% of herpes. People either get it or they don't. There's always a chance. Your point has been discussed at length on these forums before. Here's a blog I wrote about this double standard you're pointing to: https://herpeslife.com/disclosing-cold-sores-oral-herpes-hsv-1-to-potential-partners-before-kissing/ There is a preference that we have as a community here. That preference is for transparency and openness. Especially when it comes to the kind of intimacy that sex involves (even if it's only sex for one night). And you might be surprised that disclosing might actually make the sex that much hotter! (I know, it kind of blew my mind a bit, too.) Integrity, vulnerability and consideration of another human being is just super hot. And finding this out and practicing it in my life is what had me so inspired to share it and create this whole Herpes Opportunity thing in the first place. So the question becomes: Which feeds the hype and stigma more? Shamelessly talking about sex and the risks (and awesomeness) involved or not talking about anything and jumping straight into bed? I've seen so many examples of having the talk actually brings people CLOSER together because of the shared humanity that it brings (and yes, even one night stands). You might want to check out the e-book here: http://eepurl.com/b4IPP and Lifestyle Guide #3 that's all about how to have the talk that leads to super hot and connected sex. https://herpesopportunity.com/guides.php               2Legit2Quit        October 2015       TOUGH LOVE ALERT @hippyherpy one, I will start off saying, based on what you said on your post,  would it really even make a difference to your conscious if we told you it is wrong to do so, because I have a sneaking suspicion you will be deceitful despite what we tell you? In part of the article you shared the following:  Researchers have shown that viral shedding of herpes virus occurs very often from the genitals of the infected partner even when the infected partner has no symptoms: In some cases over 80% of the time. This means that an infected partner can transmit herpes to the uninfected partner even when no symptoms are present. ^^^^  W information like that, why would you think it is OK to not disclose? The risk is still there and while you feel it's not a big deal, for some it is. First off, the devastation it creates mentally for people is the biggest problem. I watch people come on forums devastated, become severely depressed and some talk of suicide. How selfish is that of you, to decide for someone else whether it is a big deal or not, because getting your rocks off is more important?   Secondly, for some people such as myself, this virus has wrecked havoc on their health. I have multiple autoimmune diseases, which not only made my primary OB horrific, it caused such severe neuropathy on my buttock, back of thighs, w electrical shooting pain to all 22 location's of my sores that I could see, but in my vagina, feet and rectum. I felt like a burn victim and had to go to the ER and be out on anticonvulsants for four months, which had horrific side effects. To this day, over a yr later, I have constant obs, despite taking meds daily, can no longer sit on hard surfaces, as I always have tenderness on my tailbone, back of  thighs and buttock. At my one yr mark, I had 8 back to back obs for two months straight. If someone has cancer, gets cancer and goes through treatment that suppresses their immune system, it will wreck havoc. People w diabetes will have a harder time w it and anyone w autoimmune disease for that matter. So are you going to ask for a run down of their medical history first, to know that it shouldn't be much trouble for them, if they get it? I got this from someone who lied to my face about having it and I find it highly inappropriate for you to treat others health so wrecklessly, as if you are God, to pick and choose that for another.there are plenty on here who have caught herpes, despite using protection and the number for reducing shedding by that study is pretty exaggerated, it is not that high and other studies will contest that number.  This hits home w me, because it was somebody w your same mentality, that has changed my health significantlysignificantly for life. If I even stop taking the meds, I develop severe chronic fatigue. One hr or more of physical activity will deplete me to the point I'm barely functioning, feel sick and will sleep for 15hrs and still need two more days to recover. You don't know if you are going to infect someone who has this type of reaction, not to mention, most seem to have a conscious and believe in disclosure and now you've made their life harder and have to deal w the fear of rejection. It is not OK to play God?  Just remember, KARMA....for me, those low transmission numbers don't apply to me, because I seem to be active the majority of a month and I cannot reassure a partner of low transmission.. That's not fair to do that to someone else . Lastly I will add, it is illegal to knowingly have sex w soneone and not disclose and they can take legal action if they catch it. Not only can they sue you for damages, but cost of medical treatment for the rest of their life for it AND it is public information, so it will be in the paper and people will know your name and face.  This is just my honest opinion, as I'm the face of someone who chose to lie to me.. I could be the girl you infect.              2Legit2Quit        October 2015       Also, in regards to bow many people of of x have it, your numbers are wrong. You say you're basically doing a girl a favor taking her home and saving her from others, but it is 1 in 4 women who have it, it is 1 in 8 men... So, you're not saving her if that's what you think and mentalities such as this, are why HSV is at epidemic proportions.              2Legit2Quit        October 2015       Also, I never have slept around. I went two yrs no sex and had sex once and got this. The assumption that being promiscuous us why you get it, is way off. There are more people I see that aren't promiscuous who get it, than are.       Ace "the Talk"! Download your free e-book & handouts now .         hippyherpy        October 2015       If someone asked me I wouldn't lie about. How many people out there have your condition? How many people out there with your condition would sleep around like one night stand knowing they had your condition and what could happen? I'd have no problem talking about it if they want to bring it up, but why should it be up to me to bring it up? Also compare .04 % transmission to 5-10% of viral shedding for that 1/8 people ( works out to possible 1.25% ) who don't know they have it- it's less of a chance. So, yes if this is the case, they have less of a chance of getting than with some random dude. People are rolling the dice when they go home with a stranger, and they might be rolling the dice even in a monogamous relationship. You missed the point of the article. It said, yes, in some cases 80% of the time viral shedding can occur, but with Valtrex- it reduces the shedding by 80%.. it didn't say that viral shedding will still be there 80% of the time with Valtrex- that the Valtrex works to supress it. I was shocked when I found out I had it, but the truth is I should have gotten it a long time ago. I didn't get the risks before. For me, it's been a few blisters that went away. I take a pill everyday, and I don't have any problems. Some one like yourself, in the situation that you are in, I can understand why you'd be mad if you knew about what you had and the person lied to you anyway. That is a true betrayal. However, that's very different from a situation in which the infected partner is doing the opposite of the reckless thing and taking all the measures to drop transmission rate down .04% which probably lower than the rate you'd expect from sharing a towel or whatever. Not to belittle your situation, but the legality of herpes is very screwed up. How you can prove that a particular person gave it to you, especially if you are sleeping around a lot? Someone with herpes can be taken to court for this and then think they are guilty even when they might not be. Check out this article: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/19/jail-herpes-sexually-transmitted-infection ".. given the widespread incidence of herpes infection in the general population (70% have facial herpes (cold sores) and 10% genital herpes according to the Herpes Viruses Association) and that people may pass on the virus through "asymptomatic shedding", millions of people have been rendered potential criminals, including, presumably, those who pass on cold sores through kissing (how is "sexually transmitted" to be defined?). Third, given that herpes may be dormant for a long time, people may assume that it is a current partner who has transmitted it when in fact it was a previous one (the science is insufficient to establish that this is not the case), and people may ill-advisedly plead guilty when confronted with an allegation."              Anna01        October 2015        @hippyherpy Well I first I want to say "Yay for the advancements in medicine". That is extremely exciting for us and potential partners in the future. The lower the risk of transmission the better right? As far as not disclosing, in my personal opinion, I would like to guide you away from that way of thinking. The truth is....like Adrial said...you perpetuate the stigma. Secrecy, betrayal, hiding things like this makes herpes seem worse than we know it is. You have a very open perspective on the matter. Which I do as well. I KNOW it is not a huge health risk for MOST. Unfortunately it is major for some people like @2Legit2Quit . Because there is a possibility of transmission (no matter how small) we have a responsibility to others and ourselves, to give potential partners a choice. You would be quite shocked at how many people are still interested in casual sex with you. I wouldn't say don't disclose because of the minimal risk but DO disclose because of it. Spread the word. Let people know the statistics. You control yourself. All I can do is hope to guide you in the right direction. I for one think it is extremely important to let someone know prior to sex. It shows you hold no shame in this. Why should you? So my vote is to be open. Be honest. Own your condition. You think that not disclosing is beating the stigma but it is not. It continues the cycle of people associating negative feelings with the infection. Also, are you sure you want people to look at you that way? Do you really want to be known as the guy who knew he had herpes, didn't say anything but gave it to a girl? I am on the receiving end of that guy and let me tell you.....I don't care for him very much. I hope this helps. -Anna              hippyherpy        October 2015       Adriel, you make a good point. How can someone disclose on a one night stand? In my experience so far, the minute someone hears "herpes" they are out the door. It happened to me recently. There's a lot of advice out there for women saying things like "herpes is great because it helps me screen out the guys who aren't into me" etc. There is very little advice for guys who want to have casual sex. Combine super low transmission rate of .04% with the fact that it is a shared responsibility- it takes two people to have sex. If one person doesn't ask, why should I have to bring it up? Here's another example to illustrate my point. Let's say you are a straight man (read: not gay at all and the thought of having sex with another man makes induces nausea) and you meet a girl who seems super attractive. You allow her to give you oral sex, then later you find out that she was really a man dressed as woman. Like Herpes, what's done is done, and you can't erase that memory. Like most cases of herpes, the actual physical problems that would come after the fellatio incident are negligible (or in the case of herpes, very manageable considering that anyone, even people with no money can get health insurance and get a Valtrex prescription now). It can even be argued that the psychological distress that someone who goes through that experience could be similar to the stress caused by the false stigma of herpes. The question is- is the man dressed like a woman really at fault? He/she was just doing his/her thing. The guy on the receiving end of the oral sex didn't ask if it was a man or a woman, so I think it's his responsibility to deal with the consequences and how he feels about the situation. That's how I think about my herpes infection.. it's not life threatening and I had it coming. I don't blame the person who gave it to me. ---- Also, on the topic of disclosure.. For famous people who are known to have it, like Derek Jeter.. does he have to have "the talk" with new girls? It's public knowledge that he has it, so doesn't that count as disclosure. Which makes me think- if there was an online database where people who have herpes could list their names for all the public to see.. would they still have to have "the talk"- since it would be out there in the public, wouldn't it be up to the person that was considering having sex with them to look it up?              hippyherpy        October 2015       Like you, Adriel- you're name is out there. You have a website that tells the world "I have herpes" Why should you have to have "the talk" If some girl is interested in having sex with you, she can you look you up online. A lot of girls do that kind of snooping/stalking when they are considering a man for a relationship beyond a one night stand anyway.              hippyherpy        October 2015       Anna, if I believed I had a significant risk of passing on herpes, I wouldn't have sex with people without disclosing. But that is not the case with a .04% risk of transmission. Also, I know that the power of the stigma because I believed it too before I got herpes. It's not a secret or betrayal if the other person doesn't ask. If they ask, then we can have the talk and I can tell them ".04%" and how billions of dollars have probably been spent trying to keep a false stigma alive so that big pharma can make a lot more money.

I just wanted to see how you'd disclose to me." It was super cute, hilarious and a beautiful moment. And it opened up an amazing conversation that was vulnerable, funny and deeply connecting. And why did I disclose? Because I care about the health and happiness of whoever I'm going to be intimate with. Because I want to treat others how I want to be treated. Because integrity is super important to me. And heck, it's just the decent thing to do. Ask any good woman out there what the sexiest thing is in a man ... One word: INTEGRITY. Try it out. All it takes is practice; and it's a fucking awesome feeling to live life in such deep integrity. And the *side effect* of living life like this is that it happens to be very attractive. To answer all your questions about how to do it, again, check out the links I gave above. It's a powerful perspective shift that can actually make the fact that you have herpes a good thing. It tends to force all these good qualities that you might have been suppressing to the forefront. You might think of it as your — ahem — opportunity. Here's what it comes down to: If sex is just for getting off and there's no need or desire for any human connection, then why not just masturbate or get a blow-up doll?              Sil88        October 2015    edited October 2015       At least you've come here to try and justify it, it shows there's still an element of indecision. Here's what bothers me.. my giver had a one-nighter with a guy. A few months on, I dated her with honest intentions and looking for a relationship - we had the std talk, she had tested clear recently and we used condoms, but I caught it anyway - within a couple of weeks. I didn't have it coming like you say you did, but transmission seems to be much easier shortly after infection. Your crowd aren't likely to wait a year before having the next one night stand are they? If you give it to one girl tomorrow, either she won't know and start her own family tree of + partners, or she'll face the same awkward dilemna and it's up to her to change instead. Honestly, I've had the same thoughts myself.. only with hypothetical ONS. But for me I'd rather be responsible, give my conscience an easy time, and impress serious prospects with some integrity. In my experience, all the girls who have heard "herpes" have all still been interested. (only 3, and I didn't just meet them on a night out, but still..) Btw, if you're from the UK I doubt we even have to discuss about legal implications.              hippyherpy        October 2015       I do want human connection- masturbation isn't the same. You can experience strong connections from casual sex. Also, I'm not looking for a girlfriend. That's a cool story though about her googling you. Girls love to snoop haha .04% is so small that I don't consider that a threat to their health- and if they are like the majority of people who don't have a condition like 2legit, then it's really not a "threat" to their health. That's thing- we keep framing herpes as being a threat to health or as dangerous, but it's generally not. It's cold sores on your genitals. Little kids give HSV to each other all the time. There are so many other things that can cause complications on the level of what 2legit is dealing with, yet they don't have the same stigma as herpes. If it was so dangerous, then they'd put us all in quarantine. They don't even do that for HIV patients. Off topic, but as life threatening as HIV is, it too can be managed to the point where I know of someone who has HIV who gets his levels checked and it often doesn't even show up in the test results because his medicine has knocked it out so much.               chikitta13        October 2015       There's a whole thread on hsv and casual sex. It's worth taking a look at. Generally speaking, the risk is minimal but it's still there. Just some food for thought, what happens if you do transmit the virus. Are you comfortable with that? And comfortable with saying to that person yeah I knew, but telling people was preventing me from getting laid? Idk but really it is about integrity. And that's your decision. For the record, I disclosed in a casual sex situation, and my partner wasn't particularly concerned. As long as protection was used.              chikitta13        October 2015        https://herpeslife.com/herpes-forum/discussion/70/herpes-disclosure-and-casual-sex#latest        Ace "the Talk"!

Again, if I thought I was putting someone at a serious risk of getting dangerous disease, I wouldn't be having sex with them in the first place. I'm here because I'm new to this and want to get the real on what herpes is and what it means to have it. I'm betting we are going to see a huge rise in the number of people who have it in the near future. You can thank YOLO and hook-up culture for that. What's up with the UK and legal implications? I read that one article about the guy who went to jail for fourteen months. That's a damn shame and I completely disagree with that verdict. I posted the article earlier in this thread. All it is doing is feeding the wallets of the pharmaceutical companies who not only make money off of herpes medicine, but all the anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication that someone might decide to go on after finding out they got it thanks to the relatively recent (early 1980s) push to stigmatize the virus.

Risk is risk. No matter how small the percent of transmission is, the risk of giving this to another individual is there. You can make an excuse all you want...the risk is small, I used a condom, she didn't ask so I didn't tell. It isn't about the other person and whether or not they were responsible. It is about you. It is about the type of person you want to be. This isn't a bacteria. It is a virus and it sticks with you for life. So no matter how small it is in your mind, it is still kind of a big deal to a lot of people. So much to the point that we should give people a choice. If a girl doesn't ask you straight out, that doesn't mean you shouldn't tell her. You should tell her for her well being and for your own. Conscience is a powerful thing and you need to be careful with it. Don't do things that might weigh on you later. Also like Adrial said integrity is extremely attractive....extremely! My ex made a huge mistake when he didn't disclose to me. He underestimated my depth. If he would've been honest I wouldn't have dumped him over it. In my experience with disclosure I have told a few guys. One I am dating now and two are friends of mine. When I told them, I was extremely confident, I was honest and I held no shame. They both like me more now. They wonder why we never dated and they find me MORE attractive because of how I am handling this. My honesty lets them know they can trust me. Honesty is a beautiful thing. Honesty doesn't require a question. Someone I plan to be intimate with doesn't need to ask me if I have an STI because I will tell them. I will tell them without shame because there is nothing to be ashamed of. I feel THAT is how we can break the stigma.               hippyherpy        October 2015        WCSDancer2010 said: I'm heading out the door to work, so I can't give a full response (YET!) but I'm going to give you a bunch of links that will show you that your idea that no one will want to have sex with you if you disclose is waaay off base ...

And, what are the odds that if they do get it, that's it's going to be terrible or unmanageable? If the odds were high, then we'd see kids getting quarantined if they had cold sores- it would be treated like the plague. Here's a question for you guys who think this is such a bad disease: Why would you sleep with anyone at all, even if they consented, if you believed this was such a terrible disease? Especially if "not everyone responds to it" as well as I have. Who knows- they might consent to it, and then, if it's really so terrible, end up with some terrible complications do to herpes that they weren't aware was possible.. but wait a second, if that were the case then they'd put herpes up there with HIV legally. They haven't done that though. This is the problem with framing herpes as a terrible thing. In some ways, the hysteria around herpes reminds me of the hysteria surrounding marijuanna in the 1950s especially when we consider the fact that people who have oral herpes- almost the exact same thing and actually with more potential for complications, don't have to disclose. Something doesn't make sense.               hippyherpy        October 2015       It's not that I wouldn't disclose if asked, but I don't yet see the need to bring it up if the other person doesn't ask about it.              2Legit2Quit        October 2015       Well, first off, I was in the process of being tested for autoimmune disease's, I hadn't even made it to the rheumatologist, but was waiting, so I had no idea that my symptoms were autoimmune related, but had a suspicion. Many people walk around w autoimmune diseases and unaware of them and NOBODY knows that it was going to wreck havoc on someone w autoimmune diseases. Herpes is still a poorly misunderstood virus and we are just now learning that other herpes viruses we get as kids, are the cause and/or linked to other autoimmune diseases, including some cancers. Had I wanted to, I could prove the person who gave it to me. You see, w new infections, you will come up negative in blood which I did, but positive in swab... I have evidence to prove he gave it to me and lied, for me, everything I was going through at the moment wasn't worth the mental energy to take legal action. Sometimes that is not worth getting retribution, at least for me it wasn't. . You don't know if he was doing what he could to not transmit it  as I didn't share that part w you. Law doesn't care that you're taking preventive measures as you are, they care you did not discle and passing it knowingly, as you are taking the persons right to choose away. Any articles you find on it, I have already read BTW. :-) May I ask how old you are? Why not give the STD dating sites a shot? My buddy only goes there to meet girls and if he just wants casual sex and you'd be surprised how many are actually game for casual sex. Now you both know what you're dealing w and can feel safer about not catching something else, because these people are likely more aware now of their body now and willing to be more careful, after the lesson of Herp. @adrial this thread and the comments about that married man who was part of a swingers group, got it ans then gave it to his wife, who was not aware of his group activity and she got pregnant around the same time. I feel that thread would be a very informative one for @hippyherpy to read, especially because I believe that guy was trying to break down the statistics and numbers and you had to explain how it doesn't work that way. Hippyherpy, Actually yes, the man/woman is at fault and that is why some have had charges dismissed after they beat up the trans person or even killed them (at least on a lesser charge) such as a crime of passion or what not. Yes, they have even been addressing this issue when it comes to it and should there be legal recourse. That person is absolutely responsible for lying and not disclosing. There are plenty of people out there available who will accept that person's situation.  Nothing good comes from lies Actually, they are finding out more and more, that people have been misdiagnosed and mental disorders they have, are a result of an autoimmune disease, such as thyroid disease. Bipolar disorder and depression has been identified as this as well, so that shows you right there, more people have autoimmune issues or would eventually develop them, than we ever thought before. We are just now  learning these things and we can't make wreckless assumption about people's health status.  I don't feel that you should be assuming these wild assumptions about how serious H is, in regards to health, because yes for most it isn't a huge deal, but how do you know you're not going to infect that one person that it causes meningitis and other major complications and possibly get sick and die. You're playing Russian roulette.   You're playing God... Also, we have some recent conversations going on here w people who are out on their profilesprofiles and Dancer is another one. They all will tell you, that it has made them get even more responses and still be game for sex, even being they are negative. Now doing that, you put the ball in their court, to take the risk of contracting it. Since 1 in 4 women have it, you're likely to have some pretty good prospects numbers wise.              Anna01        October 2015       When I look at 1/223, one thing stands out to me...the number 1. That is 1 person. I would rather give that one person a choice vs keeping this info to myself and they come to me a couple weeks later, crying and sobbing because they are having their first OB. Just saying.              Sil88        October 2015       Can anybody guide me to the research behind the 0.4% figure? I've seen the figures but have a hard time believing them.              Nal        October 2015       I got it during my first ever time, with someone I'd known for 3 months, who tested negative across the board (I saw his results), who didn't know herpes wasn't tested, didn't recognise his incredibly mild symptoms, hence didn't know he had it. And we used condoms throughout. I've been in a lot of physical pain, my holiday was pretty much ruined for the most part and now I'm dealing with this for the rest of my life, not knowing how much pain I'll have to endure in the future. Now I already have much peace with this, because the man who gave it to me genuinely didn't know and is very sorry to do this to me and is having to get tested himself next Monday (I wish I could go with him and hold his and but sadly I can't). If he could've given me a choice on whether he was worth the risk he would've. And I'm 100% sure I would've taken the risk and not regretted it even if I'd been infected. I can live with what happened. Now, if I would have had a one-night-stand with someone who knew they had it and didn't tell me, I'd probably want to kick his balls out of his mouth. With as much pain and panic I've gone through the past 2 weeks, I would not want to risk contaminating someone without giving them the right to decide for themselves whether they want to take that risk or not. I don't know if you realise it, but your magic sex might not be worth it to some and they have the right to make that decision. You don't get to decide for someone else whether your sexy times are worth getting a lifelong skin condition for. Even if it's just a skin condition. It's also just casual sex. I would be livid and bitter and have a much harder time accepting all this than I do now. You really don't get to decide whether someone else thinks your penis is worth the risk. Once you know, it's sort of evil not to disclose, even if the risk is fairly low If I were not given a choice, that's not a person worthy of seeing me naked and I'd feel very betrayed if someone did this to me. I'd instantly regret having slept with that person. It's just really selfish. Even if it's manageable, you have to let people decide whether they want to risk having to manage anything.              hippyherpy        October 2015       Russian Roulette? If you could really compare it to putting a gun to someone's head, then why don't they lock up the millions of children that have cold sores to protect the others that don't? The person has a right to not have sex. If they ask if you have herpes and you say "no" then you are lying. I can see how that would be an illegal thing. If you are transparent, then can you really be to blame? If they don't ask or make an attempt to find out, why should that be your problem? It may sound callous, but logically speaking, it doesn't make sense that all of the responsibility should go on the infected person's shoulders. There is a difference between someone who goes around with a herpes outbreak and doesn't use condoms (or even with a condom) vs. someone who is sleeping with people on outbreaks and making an attempt to reduce the risk as much as possible. Regardless of how bad you think herpes is, the first person is being reckless and the second one is not. Can you really say that someone who is reducing the risk down to .4% is being reckless? Think about it like this- What are the chances that you are walking to the store and a car swerves out of control and hits you? The driver did everything right, but something he had no control over went wrong with the car which caused the crash. Can you call him reckless? If that was the case then everyone who is driving cars is reckless because they could be potentially be putting someone in danger because 10-12% of car accidents are due to mechanical failure.               Nal        October 2015       Having safe sex when you have no STIs is like driving a car. Having safe sex while having an STI that's not entirely prevented by condoms and not telling the other person is like driving a car and texting at the same time, hitting someone and then blaming them for not asking you not to text and drive at the same time. 'How did I know you didn't want me to drive and text, you didn't tell me up front.' Not my fault I hit you with my car.' You don't get to decide whether the risk is low enough or not for someone else. You just don't have that right. Just because you think it's low enough, doesn't mean someone else does too.              hippyherpy        October 2015        Sil88 said: Can anybody guide me to the research behind the 0.4% figure?

That's a load of bull.         « 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 »   Sign In or Register to comment.        Powered by Vanilla               Informational Blog  Support Forum  Start Here!

RunningScared        April 2014    edited April 2014   in General herpes discussion      Hi everyone, No easy way to say this so I'll just come right out...  I had unprotected sex yesterday with a girl I really like who has had genital herpes for well over 10 years.  She has been on antivirals (aciclovir?) for a long time and said she hasn't had an outbreak in over a year, and has never to her knowledge passed it on to any other partners.  To be honest, and much to her credit, she informed me in advance of her condition, but in a moment of passion I rather stupidly decided to just inspect her visually and then go for it.  I was under the impression that it was only contagious during the OB period, and wasn't aware of asymptomatic shedding until I started researching later. I wound up doing unprotected oral on her for over an hour, and for a few minutes later on we engaged in intercourse, along with plenty of other genital-to-genital contact, all unprotected. Now, the next day, I am of course freaking out and kicking myself for being so reckless...  I spent all night and all day today googling information, which led me here.  So my question is, what are the chances that I've picked up the virus from this event, taking into consideration the length of time she's had it, the constant medication, and long time since her last OB?  Am I fairly safe or am I hosed? I'd like to be in a relationship with her because we click really well and like each other a lot, but really don't want to pick up the disease for the sake of my future love interests, if we don't work out.  Not to mention for my own personal health.  If I stay with her it will be nearly impossible to resist more unprotected sex and oral... am I pretty much guaranteed to pick it up in this case? I'm a crazy jumble of thoughts right now and don't know what to think or do. Thanks in advance for your input.       Comments          alex08        April 2014       While it is contagious at any time, during OB is a definite no no. Everyone is different but my bf and I have been together 7 years and he has never had any symptons. Just keep an eye out. Doctors can also do a blood test if you don't have symptoms. Also just fyi it's still possible to contract it during protected sex. Btw I laughed out loud at 'inspect her visually'!       Ace "the Talk"! Download your free e-book & handouts now .         RunningScared        April 2014    edited April 2014       Haha... yeah I guess that was inadvertently a bit comical.  Shows you my level of ignorance though... ugh. Do you and your BF regularly have unprotected sex and oral?  According to my calculations, if the female-to-male transmission rate is 2% per year of regular sex when an antiviral but no condom is used, that equates to roughly a .0015% chance of transmission per round of sex (assuming sex 2-3 times per week). So "theoretically", there is roughly a .0015% chance that I contracted it last night?   I'm also guessing significantly less than that for the oral portion?  Does that sound accurate?              Sparklepony        April 2014       First, STAY OFF GOOGLE. It will make you crazy. Second, Yes there is a risk you could have had herpes passed along to you. There is ALWAYS a risk. Even with protected sex. However, if she is on suppressive meds then the chance is very small. If she was not experiencing prodome, an outbreak, or shedding then that risk is pretty much non existent. The thing is, she could be have a pending outbreak (prodome) and not know it. Every time it can be different in mildness and symptoms. Herpes is a no rule virus. It seems like you probably would not have gotten it passed to you though. The risk would be extremely small. The best thing you can do is just watch your body closely, and if it still bothers you after you've had time to think rationally again (totally normal to panic right now), get tested in about 3 months. That's all you can do really. You mentioned that the two of you really click and you could see it going somewhere. If so, know that you are always at risk and then decide if you are willing to take that risk.              WCSDancer2010        April 2014        @RunningScared Honey ... BREATHE!!! You are waaay overthinking this. So here is a reality check that @Unhappy1 came up with: Look, there were 135 Space Shuttle flights, two of them blew up. That means there was a 1.5% risk of death for going up in the shuttle. No man in the U.S. would ever say no if NASA gave him a seat on the shuttle, I assure you of that! Now if he's willing to take a 1.5% chance of death for a good ride, don't you think he would take a .015% chance of a skin infection for your ride? [Risk of transmission when no outbreak, on Valtrex, and with condoms is about 1.5% per year (which includes sex 2x week for 52 weeks about 100 occurrences).] Or as I like to point out, If we get in our car, we do certain things to reduce the risk of injury to ourselves and others. We get a license. We wear a seat belt. We buy a car with Airbags... some also have traction control/all-wheel drive/warning systems/etc. We maintain the tires and brakes. We obey traffic signals and laws. And hopefully we don't drive impaired. Now, in spite of all that, we might be in an accident some day. AND, some people take more precautions than others. Some barely pay any mind to any of them. The chance of you dying in a car accident in your lifetime is 2%... but that doesn't keep you from driving, does it? So- it would be useful to know which variety she has HSV1 or 2 ... if it's H1, it doesn't shed as much so with the antivirals your risk will be even lower than the 2% you rightly quoted. So here's the deal - you have a much better chance of getting it from someone else who believes they are H- but who likely hasn't been tested. Sounds like this young lady knows her body and is on the antivirals... as someone who has had this 35 yrs I have not knowingly passed it to anyone since I got divorced (I didn't know I had it and gave it to my ex hubby, but our split was over something completely unrelated). I would get tested now (because I assume you have never been tested for Herpes....and likely not chlamydia either because you have to ASK for both of them with your STD panel). Then if you are still worried, get tested in about 4-5 months if you don't have any symptoms. From now on, or at least until you feel more comfortable with the relationship and how she manages her Herpes, use a condom from now on. And if it doesn't work out, use this as a learning experience to at least use a condom in the early days of a relationship... for your own safety and theirs... until you are sure you want to be exclusive. Then go get tested together... that way you know for sure about your status and theirs (((HUGS)))              RunningScared        April 2014    edited April 2014       Thank you very much for the feedback and advice everyone.  It's going to be one heck of a decision, that's for sure.  We talked about it at length last night and she answered all of my questions.  Apparently she has both HSV-1 and HSV-2, but has only had several cold sores on her mouth over the last 15+ years.  The HSV-2 affects her lower labia. She is taking Acyclovir twice daily, but she said she only takes it once per day when she's single and there is no chance of her having sex.  Is that an acceptable way of taking it? Should *I* take it as a preventative?  Not sure if it will prevent contraction of the disease but might be worth it if it can. She has had several partners that she was with for years at a time, and apparently they never used any protection, nor was she on antivirals at the time, and she did not pass it on to any of them.  Even to this day she says she asks them about it whenever she talks to them and they say they're clean and to stop worrying... lol. Is it possible that some people might be less likely to pass it on than others?  As much as I like her I just don't know if I can justify the risk...  if it's not already too late for me. Thanks again all.              WCSDancer2010        April 2014    edited April 2014        She is taking Acyclovir twice daily, but she said she only takes it once per day when she's single and there is no chance of her having sex. Is that an acceptable way of taking it? Twice a day is the normal prescribed amount and I don't blame her for cutting to one a day when she's not with anyone. I don't take it at all except for OB's when I'm single. Should *I* take it as a preventative? It is not prescribed as a preventative I have also had 2 partners that were 3 yrs, used anti-virals for one because he was like you and was very scared of getting it... didn't for the other because he didn't care. Neither caught it from me. My ex hubby got it from me but I was having a lot of OB's then and thought it was heat rash because back then they tested even less for it then (30 years ago) than they do now I *personally* think you are in a way safer with someone who KNOWS they have it than with most other people who are blissfully ignorant and believe they have been tested when most of them have indeed never been tested for it. So unless you plan to DRASTICALLY change your sexual practices (Date for at LEAST 4 months with no sex and then skip to the STD clinic together to get tested before doing the deed) know that EVERY SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH A NEW PARTNER ASSUMES THE RISK OF AN STD AND/OR PREGNANCY. The CDC says we will ALL likely get HPV at some point in our lives. 80% of the population has Herpes and 80% of them don't know it. . If you are that worried, you better go out and buy the safest car you can find, wear a helmet, and wrap yourself in bubble wrap before you drive next time.... because your risk of just getting INJURED in a car accident is likely higher than you getting HSV from her if she's on the antivirals and you can reduce it even more by using condoms if you are that worried. (Which is not a bad idea if you don't want "Baby-daddy" added to your status on FB... I tell young guys all the time that my daughter got pregnant while on BC.... so if you don't want THAT responsibility, wrap it up!) Bottom line. LIFE.ASSUMES.RISK. Period. If she means enough to you, IMO she's worth the risk. If you are not sure, go back to dating until you are sure. But I believe as a carrier that I'm one hell of a catch and one day, the right guy will realize that... because I have waaay more integrity than most of the women out there both around my sexual life and my personal life. She sounds like she is another who is TRYING to be honest with you. If you choose to move on based on her HSV status, then do so knowing that your next partner may not be as honest and forthcoming (((HUGS)))        Ace "the Talk"!

Thank you! By the way, is it an accurate assumption that HSV-2 transmission from genitals to the face is even more rare than genital to genital?

An BTW, OB's are the perfect excuse to explore other ways to be intimate because you are forced to get creative               RunningScared        April 2014       Well guys, thought I'd update you on my decision. I've decided to stick it out with this girl and see what happens.  I'm planning to take an HSV-1 & HSV-2 test in a couple weeks to get a baseline and make sure I don't already have anything to begin with.  Then in a few months or if things don't work out, get tested again. Thanks for the feedback and advice everyone.  She's too much of a kindred spirit to just drop because of this.

EmmaLynn__Xx        April 2012    edited September 2013   in Herpes question(s)      Basically a simple question that I can never find an answer to. My doctor told me and a friend who also has H, that its fine to have sex with a partner when herpes symptoms aren't showing. So basically, when they're no blisters, you can't catch herpes? My friend has been having sex with guys when her blisters aren't there, but I've done my research and found out it can be caught..always! Basically my Doctor wasn't helpful, he told me the basics about herpes but never about sex & passing it on. I asked my friend again the other day and she said "Emma when the sores aren't there it's basically like the herpes isn't there!" So I thought wow I can actually have sex after a year of none. But I had to check here first. I even have a leaflet from the doctors about herpes that clearly reads this... "Can I pass the virus to a partner if I have no symptoms?" Here's the answer, "When the virus is dormant/inactive inside the nerve cells it cannot be caught by others, if the virus is on the skin, it may be passed on." This seems crazy, I'm sorry but my friend has the same booklet and she went on this information and has been having casual sex, have I done the right thing by not having sex at all ever since I found out? I wonder if I should have her attitude! She is loving life, lol. Tell me as much as you know about giving it to someone else please, thanks everyone x       « 1 2 3 » Comments          adrial        April 2012    edited September 2013       That's simply not true. Unfortunately the medical community seems to still be either clueless or simply not care enough to learn the basics of herpes. Here is a post on the blog I wrote about asymptomatic viral shedding . If sores aren't present, then there is about a 10% chance of spreading herpes from male to female and a 4% chance of spreading herpes from female to male (less mucous membrane on the penis, more on the vagina) due to viral shedding. And you never know when this viral shedding is occurring; it happens silently. These risks of spreading herpes are lessened by a large degree if you're taking daily suppressive therapy (Valtrex, Acyclovir, etc.), so consider doing that if you're having sex with someone who doesn't have herpes. But regardless of all the protective measures you're taking, new partners should know that you have herpes! Your friend should be telling her partners! She is risking passing herpes to them. (Not to mention, she's risking getting whatever they have if they aren't having an honest STD conversation before doin' the do!)

I have had friends told the same thing when i have encouraged them to get tested - they have been told all sorts of misinformation.  I am finding too that people over 40 who have it a long time are doing the same as your friend, they were told on diagnosis years ago that they won't pass it on without symptoms and of course they believe it - if they have had no symptoms they haven't needed to talk about it and still think that the advice is true.  This is how i caught it...I was as ignorant as my partner even though we had each talked to our doctors. That's why I think this site and others like it are invaluable...we learn from each other and help each other do the right thing by ourselves and those we are intimate with.

I just can't see how I am going too keep staying strong with this.. I have such bad days sometimes.. like today lol! I just know I have to wait till I'm older to settle down with someone who will accept it & I'm just so lonely.              adrial        April 2012       I feel sad reading your response, EmmaLynn. It hurts my heart. Holding yourself back because of fear of being rejected is pre-rejecting yourself from everyone, including all those guys who would be totally psyched to be with you — with or without herpes. Have you downloaded the free e-book on disclosure yet? It walks you through the mindset and the actual disclosure itself that happens when you're whole and love who you are. Let yourself heal and re-connect to loving yourself again, yes. But also realize when you're actually holding yourself back from moving on and letting someone love you for you. Don't hold yourself back anymore when you don't need to.

It sounds strange but I've lived here all my life and I know everyone, if I was to tell a guy, he would freak and tell everyone. So I need to wait until I'm older to find someone mature enough to know what herpes actually is, and not judge me. If anybody was to find out I had herpes I would not be able to leave my house lol. I wish I could turn back time and go back to my normal life               dabrat81        April 2012       EmmaLynn, I feel the same exact way as you!       Ace "the Talk"! Download your free e-book & handouts now .         lelani        April 2012       I do know how you feel..I am very well known (have been on TV and sang in a well known band here in my city...amoungst other public stuff).  I have been pretty open with my family and close friends (both men and women)...yet i am not actively dating anyone close to home.  I have been amazed at the support from those I have told, even my adult kids (that was a tough one but i want them to be informed too and it was hard to hide how sick i kept getting for several months). I have discolsed to dates and it does get easier and the e book will help.  I think different age groups have different difficulties with disclosing and definitely as you get older the more mature and accepting people are.  But its getting it right with yourself first and accepting and loving yourself - that what I have found, I found myself again and then it got easier telling others. I'm sorry you are feeling so lonely...you aren't alone though and I am sending you good thoughts.              healing        April 2012       So that means I have to use condoms for the rest of my sexual life? Just the thought of it makes me want to be celibate forever.  Hi, I am new, I have been recently diagnosed through a routine std test, and I am asymptomatic. Never had an outbreak.              adrial        April 2012       Whoa, whoa, healing! Don't jump to extremes! Slow down, slow down! Yes, you'll have to be more careful than you once were, but think about it: it's just as much a precaution for YOU as it is for them! (You don't want to get anything else, right?) Ah, I remember my pre-herpes days ... I thought I was invincible. The whole "STDs will never happen to me" thing. And then blam, hello herpes! In a way, getting this silly little virus gives me a glimpse into my own lack of invincibility (which is a good thing to get) and allows me to be that much more careful about what I open myself up to (sexually or otherwise). And, aside from that, once you find someone who loves you for you, then herpes really takes a back seat (trust me). I'm in an awesome relationship now with my girlfriend who does NOT have herpes, and we decided together to not wear protection. I take daily suppressive therapy to keep the viral shedding and outbreaks down to minimize her chances of getting it, but when it comes down to it, she loves me for me and herpes doesn't get in the way of that. There are many risks people take in relationships, and herpes is just one of those things. So yes, you'll be more cautious and sexually aware than you once were (again, good thing) AND there's no telling what lies ahead for you as far as a relationship goes. Got it? Don't assume worst-case scenario. Your future hasn't happened yet.               healing        April 2012       Thanks, H_Opp. The thing is, I was always cautious but I guess not enough. I am recently divorced from a 11 year relationship. My ex had oral herpes and frequent outbreaks of it at the beginning of our relationship, which is probably how I unknowingly caught both genital and oral H.  We just assumed I was safe when he didn't have outbreaks. His outbreaks became less when he cleaned up his diet and in the last years of our relationship, he probably  had an outbreak once a year if at all... I have never had an outbreak, so I never had a clue that I was infected. It is hard for me. I just don't know how much more careful I am supposed to be. I don't know how to deal with relationships anymore. I don't want to have a "conversation" with potential partners and risk rejection, so I guess I will have to date people from Herpes dating sites. I work in the natural health field, so I will not be doing the usual suppressive therapy, though I will try to find alternative natural ones. Thank you all for listening. Yes, I am still grieving the loss of what I thought was my sexual purity and cleanliness. I will be okay. I am determine to love myself regardless, and some days are better than others, some nights are better than others.               rinapink76        April 2012       EmmaLynn__Xx ... Hey please Stop all the poohoo talk about u Not ever having Sex. If u are so concern with it. All U need to do Is be safe from now On. Use Condoms and u don't need to mention weather u have it or not. So when u get pressured to asking not to used it ... U may say .. 'I'm not ready for a child" "I'm in need for safety always" " No sex without it and that My final answer". Love U and Respect urself like no one will. If someone out there want u and love u they will put it on. so go have ur fun and live ur sex life up       Ace "the Talk"!

Even if condoms are involved there's still a chance of passing herpes. Nothing is ever 100%. Hell, even if suppressive therapy, condoms and a biohazard suit are involved, you're still sharing something. At least have the decency of sharing that you have herpes, too. This also brings up a whole other subject: If the other person doesn't ask if you have anything, are you obliged to be proactive and tell them that you do? My take on this is that if you're going to be intimate enough to have sex, you should be intimate enough to open up a sex conversation, too. AND ... who knows what sort of fun gifts they might have to give you? You're protecting yourself, too! What if the condom breaks and you end up with something more than a silly little herpes virus? Having the sex talk protects partners both ways. And it's just the cool thing to do.               EmmaLynn__Xx        April 2012    edited April 2012       I have come to realise that I cannot have sex until I wish to settle down with a long term partner, and this will not be until I am a lot older than 19. I met someone that I really like and I have been meeting him for months now, but I had to let him go. I am finding this really hard. Everyone has always said how me and him should be together and I am so upset, I cannot give him what someone else could give him so I've let him go. I think it was the right thing to do because at 19, he wouldn't of agreed to risk catching it from me and I dont think I have the right to put him in this horrible place that I am in. He has now found someone else and I wish I could be her so much. She is so lucky. I know I will forget him and move on, of course I will, but how many more people am I going to have to let slip away? I do concentrate on me now, I enjoy myself a lot and can do whatever I like whenever I like, but when you aren't looking for someone they just keep coming. I want my old life back so much!              rinapink76        May 2012    edited May 2012       the_H_Opp .. Yeah U are very right. its hard, plenty of ppl are not honest and how to know if they are being honest with me too, so I always carry female condoms, which I like more but of course if I get intimate with someone I do say so, Most guys they don't even care. That worries me a lot too. I have never had a condom break on me or the guy I had sex with. I understand you, I know nothing is 100% safe !!              Whatsthescoop        August 2012    edited August 2012       In need of some questions answered, A man I care dearly for has HSV1, and says he has it genitally, but has never had an outbreak down there--only oral cold sores. We've been dating since February, but only recently started having sex-- When telling me of his herpes (after our 3rd date) he explained that generally he gets one cold sore a year--however, he's now had an outbreak in July, and again this month I went to my OBGYN and am still testing negative for the virus--so I was finding your messages very informative--I didn't know of these Suppressives. They sound like a good idea for him, less outbreaks, and for me, slightly more protection from contracting the virus. When he has an active outbreak, as he does right now, kissing my forehead, neck, back, etc is alright, right? I'm under the impression that he would need to kiss my lips or other more intimate place for me to catch the virus!?!?! Help please ) Thanks in advance for your help!              adrial        August 2012    edited September 2012       Hi Whatsthescoop. Yes, if he takes suppressive therapy, you will decrease the chances by 50-80%, some studies say. Always a good thing to get on suppressive therapy to protect the partner who doesn't have herpes. Also, you're right that it's very unlikely he will pass herpes to you by kissing other parts of your body, but if he's having an outbreak, I would suggest he doesn't just in case. Herpes has been known to produce outbreaks in random places, so if there were a break in your skin, whether it's a cut or a popped zit, the virus could have an opening to the body. Better to play it safe and hold off on that until the virus is cleared up. And by the way, you can make it a game instead of an "ew gross" experience. Does that make sense? Playfully make the outbreak mean that he can touch you however he wants, but not with his mouth. My girlfriend and I play that game and it's pretty sexy. Switch the perspective and make it fun. Hold off on kissing anywhere until after the episode has passed, then reintroduce kissing ... the sparks will fly.        Ace "the Talk"!

My doctor and other counsellors have told me this.  I have never given it to anyone in 18 years.   Voila              hforumap        September 2012       Oh, only tell someone if you think the person really cares about you too.              hforumap        September 2012       If they care, and you let them know to make sure they are wearing a condomn and no outbreaks, the risk is very low.              adrial        September 2012    edited November 2013       hforumap - You should be telling ALL sexual partners that you have herpes and be clear on what the risks actually are (which are small with awareness and precautions). And yes, of course the more precautions, the less risk. AND taking suppressive therapy lessens (by anywhere from 50-80%, depending on what study you read) the risk that's still there with condoms and avoiding sex during an outbreak. And another thing to consider is what if where your outbreaks happen isn't covered by the condom? Even when an outbreak isn't present, there's still a risk due to asymptomatic viral shedding. All of these considerations are there so you can lessen the risk and then let it all go ... so you can enjoy yourself.               hforumap        September 2012    edited September 2012       Hi Adrial, I was told by a counsellor in a sex clinic that people can put a bandade on the area where outbreaks usually happen which prevents skin to skin contact helps.              lively        September 2012       Interesting  getting  down to  the nitty  gritty  on  this  page.  Just so  you  all  know, I have never  had  H  internally, ever.  This  suggests  to  me that  I  got  it from  a  guy  who  was wearing  a condom.  Pay  attention  people!  there's  plenty  external (for  a  woman)  or  non-penis (for  a  man)  skin  that  contacts  repeatedly under  pressure  when  you  are  engaged in  sex.  Definitely  not  100%  on  condoms and no  symptoms.  On  another  angle, I'm  surprised  so  many here  are  still  using  the term "outbreak"  for  symptoms.  Language  is  powerful,  could  choose  a gentler  word,  even  'symptoms' is  kinder  to your  body  and  selfimage  than  'outbreak'.  My  favourite  is  still  "episode".              lively        September 2012       When  I think  of  having  sex  with  a  bandaid  on  my  labia  I  laugh  out  loud!!  you  don't  really  think  it  would  stay  in  place  with  all  that  sliding and slipping do  you?              adrial        September 2012    edited November 2013       lively! I love it! Yes, I like episode. I also like occurrence. Anything other than a word that sounds like some dangerous criminal is trying to get out of a prison otherwise known as my body. (And FYI, why I tend to use the cliché terms is so people who are searching for those terms online can stumble upon this site. That's my excuse. AND thanks for the reminder.) And I GUFFAWED on that last one. Bandaid on my labia! That's a new rock band name waiting to happen! And seriously, a band-aid doesn't protect your partner from passing herpes. It wouldn't hurt, but definitely don't expect it to be the protection you need to keep your partner safe. Just avoid sex completely when there are any signs or symptoms of a herpes outbreak.              VirgoGirl        September 2012       labia band-aid! good one! definately sounds like a band name too! speaking of suppressives..it is something I would definately consider if I was going to be in an intimate relationship with someone, but what I am concerned about is the cost? Does it differ from province to province, or state to state? Or is it relatively the same price anywhere you go? I have heard it is quite expensive, which makes it difficult when you're a student               adrial        September 2012    edited November 2013       [Note: I am not a doctor. Consult your doc and don't take this post as medical advice.] I buy my meds (Acyclovir) through my local grocery store (Kroger) pharmacy for $40 for a 3-month supply (400mg 2x/day). And I don't have regular insurance (one of the perks of being self-employed.) Valtrex is super expensive, especially if you don't have a nice insurance plan. But everything I've read and heard says that Acyclovir and Valtrex are practically the same, you just have to take Acyclovir 2x/day instead of taking Valtrex once (V is time-released). Anyway, point is, herpes medication is super cheap! (I just wonder about the long-term health effects of taking a daily medication like that. I have my eye more on that than the cost.)              boot_fist        September 2012       To VirgoGirl, I go to Walgreens for mine, and generic Valtrex (Valacyclovir) is $10 per refill, that I'm aware. I'm not in a relationship and kind of want to see how my body reacts before I decide to go on daily suppressive therapy, but if you can ger generics of anything they're usually way cheaper. I think brand-name Valtrex is $45 through Walgreens, which is ridiculous.              lively        September 2012       Hi  Adrial,  oh  of  course,  SEO,  help  all  those people  who  have  H  acting  like a  dangerous  criminal  find  a  haven  with  you  and  your  community,  like  we  all  have .

I'm dating someone He's HSV- much LUV Carlos              crissy        September 2012       So, I just mine refilled. I use the acyclovir because it just seems to work better for me.  I'm supposed to take it twice a day 400mg but I only take it once a day.  I definitely need to supress. I paid 15.00 for a 90 day supply.  Valtrex is one of the most expensive meds out there.  Always ask if you do have insurance if you can do a 90 day supply its always cheaper than a one month. If I were to pay a one month supply its 7 dollars (generic) so, Its cheaper for me to get a 90 day supply but you have to ask your Dr. to write it out for you that way IF your health insurance will pay for it that way.

June 17, 2009 12:24 PM   Subscribe  What are my chances of contracting herpes?   I am moving out of the country in a couple weeks. I have reignited a romance with a former flame. He has genital herpes.  I knew about this before we slept together, and we always used condoms and avoided sex if he had an outbreak. I never contracted herpes while I was with him (I had a blood test after we broke up.)  We're not in any kind of relationship, we just have a special connection. I want to have some great memories and good times with him before I leave.  Is it too much of a risk to have sex, assuming we use a condom and he isn't having an outbreak? The information on the internet seems to be all over the map. One nurse I talked to seemed to think the risk was very minimal, a doctor told me she didn't think it was worth the risk.  Would anti-viral drugs be a possibility?  I'm not sure how to talk to him about this, given that we had sex before and I was fine with it.  I'm just trying to measure the risk before I make a decision. Thanks!  posted by anonymous to Health & Fitness (5 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite       I recently talked to my doctor about this, and she said the risk is pretty low (low, single percentage points, if even) if you do everything right (condoms, anti-virals, avoidance at the right times). You're more at risk as a girl, but condoms more effectively protect you as a female, too. Purely anecdotal, but I have a friend with HSV who was married for 10 years and had two long-term relationships and has never passed it to a partner. But really, it's about your own personal comfort with the risk, right? posted by lunalaguna at 12:35 PM on June 17, 2009 [ 1 favorite ]  Wikipedia : On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk of HSV-2 from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios—meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free—by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. So starting at a 10% risk (annual), if you assume the studied group had sex 100 times / year, the per-incidence trasmission risk would be 1 in 950 . Slap on a condom and have him down some antivirals and you'd looking at a ~1 in 4,000 risk. If you only care about symptomatic infections, then it's 1 in 8,000 per encounter . posted by 1VF5 at 1:08 PM on June 17, 2009  Here is a Savage Love question that is basically the same, with a reversal of genders.  I would recommend this piece of advice , for peace of mind: "Wash thoroughly with soap and water after sex; virii aren't very strong. Soap and hot water kill and/or wash away the herpes virus if it hasn't already made it through a break in your skin. "  Keep in mind that having careful sex with someone who you know the risks about is much safer than having less safe sex with a perfect stranger who could just as easily have something. If you picked up a random guy in the bar, you could be taking the exact same risk. But since you know from the start your partner has herpes, you'll be sure to take the precautions to prevent you from getting it.  Happy fuckin'! posted by Juliet Banana at 1:45 PM on June 17, 2009  Keep in mind that the virus can get into you a lot more easily if you have any breaks in your skin.  Regardless of whether he has any open sores, if you've got (for example) a nick or ingrown hair from bikini line maintenance, or tiny abrasions from the friction of sex, the virus can more easily get into your system.  So keep an eye on your own parts, and be gentle to them.  Use plenty of lube. posted by vytae at 2:09 PM on June 17, 2009  Juliet Banana has it, but obviously be aware that more vigorous washing or any kind of exfoliation is worse, not better. The most important thing is to avoid abrasions or any breaking of the skin. If your partner is not already on an anti-viral, eg Valtrex, daily therapy for him can reduce the odds of spreading the virus (even if he's already asymptomatic). posted by telegraph at 2:54 PM on June 17, 2009 [ 1 favorite ]   « Older Recomend some fund raising software.   |   Am I doomed to be a doormat forever?

Posted on September 30, 2013  by  Anna C.     Has your partner, or potential partner, recently informed you that he or she has been diagnosed with genital herpes? After thinking about it, did you decide to continue with the relationship, despite not being infected with the virus that causes genital herpes yourself? Congratulations — the two of you are now a “discordant couple,” which means that one of you has genital herpes and the other doesn’t. While you might have come to the conclusion that acquiring a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection below the belt won’t be the end of the world, you still might want to stay discordant — and do everything you can to minimize chances of virus transmission.    Condoms, medication, and abstinence during outbreaks can reduce risk for herpes transmission.    You can read all about herpes elsewhere on this blog, but here’s a quick rundown: Genital herpes can be caused by one of two strains of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 or HSV-2. While HSV-1 is more commonly associated with cold sores and HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital herpes, either virus can infect the genital area. One estimate states that 1 out of 6 Americans between 14 to 49 years of age has a genital HSV-2 infection. Since genital herpes infections can also be caused by HSV-1 , the number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.  Barring total abstinence from all sexual activity, you won’t be able to protect yourself completely from acquiring HSV — but there are many steps that you and your partner can take to decrease risk. Studies on discordant couples show that viral transmission can be reduced with condoms, antiviral herpes medications, practicing abstinence when symptoms are present, and patient education.  Condoms  Latex condoms protect against most STDs, especially fluid-borne infections like HIV and gonorrhea. But condoms also provide some protection against STDs that are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, including genital herpes. One large study found that condom usage was associated with lower rates of HSV-2 acquisition — the more frequently someone used condoms, the lower the risk. Unsurprisingly, risk was also associated with frequency of sex acts: People having vaginal or anal intercourse more than twice weekly were 77 percent more likely to acquire HSV-2 than people having less sex.  Other studies have reached similar conclusions, such as this study of monogamous, discordant couples, which found that HSV-2-positive men who used condoms were much less likely to transmit the virus to their female partners. Overall, for every 10,000 acts of vaginal or anal intercourse, 8.9 women acquired HSV-2 from their male partners, while 1.5 men acquired HSV-2 from their female partners. HSV-2 transmission also declined over the course of the study, possibly due to a decline in sexual activity between partners as well as counseling to use condoms and avoid sex during outbreaks.  It is difficult to perform good studies on the effect of condoms on disease transmission, because it’s unethical to ask one group of test subjects not to use condoms, and possibly not realistic to expect another group to use condoms consistently and correctly. Therefore, researchers must rely on self-reported data from their subjects and trust that the information they are providing is reliable and that they were using condoms correctly. However, researchers believe that these types of flaws lead to an underestimation of condoms’ effectiveness — so use ’em!  Herpes Medications (Suppressive Therapy)  A partner with genital herpes can consider daily herpes medications, such as acyclovir, which has been found to reduce viral shedding by as much as 94 percent . These medications, which are called “suppressive therapy” when taken daily, have not only been shown to reduce recurring outbreaks in symptomatic sufferers, but also to reduce asymptomatic shedding, offering another avenue for someone with genital herpes to protect his or her partner.  Other herpes medications include valacyclovir, whose efficacy was studied by a team that found a daily 500 mg. dose offered a 48 percent reduction in risk. Not only did this drug reduce the number of herpes outbreaks experienced by the partners with HSV infections, but it reduced risk for their HSV-negative partners, who were more than twice as likely to acquire HSV-2 from partners who were not taking suppressive therapy. For every 1,000 sex acts there were 0.60 cases of male-to-female herpes transmission and 0.23 female-to-male herpes transmissions. Transmission rates were even lower among couples who used condoms.  There are many alternative remedies , such as plant-based preparations or dietary supplements, touted as prevention against herpes outbreaks or transmission, but in general they are not supported by reliable evidence.  Abstinence During Outbreaks  When someone is experiencing symptoms of a genital herpes outbreak — blisters, itching, open or swollen sores, pain in the infected area — he or she is also “shedding virus,” meaning that HSV can be transmitted to others. Someone also might be able to recognize warning signs of an impending outbreak, such as burning, itching, or tingling sensations. When these types of symptoms are present, it is imperative to practice total abstinence until seven days after the sores heal. Because condoms do not cover the entire genital area, they do not provide adequate protection from the virus (condoms should always be used between outbreaks).  A partner with herpes should also avoid touching the sores, as he or she could transfer the virus to another place on the body (such as the facial area), to a contact lens, or to another person. If you have touched a herpes sore, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water immediately afterward.  Unfortunately, most HSV transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding — when there are no outbreaks.  Patient Education  In the 1980s, before the common use of herpes medications like acyclovir, one group of researchers conducted a study on HSV-2-discordant couples. This represented a “best-case scenario” in that the couples were educated on recognizing mild or atypical herpes outbreaks, were counseled to practice abstinence until four days after sores had healed, were taught about condom use, and were highly motivated to avoid HSV-2 transmission. They concluded that the risk of genital HSV transmission was:   10 percent per year, overall  20 percent per year if the partner without genital herpes had not been previously infected with HSV-1 (the virus most commonly associated with cold sores)  16 percent per year in women who already carried HSV-1  32 percent per year in women who did not carry HSV-1   Presumably, HSV transmission rates are higher in the absence of this education, safer sex practice, and desire to mitigate risk. In this study, the factors that made the biggest difference in whether or not someone caught a genital HSV-2 infection from her partner was the consistent use of condoms and spermicide, even during asymptomatic periods.  If you have a genital HSV infection, you can ask a sexual health expert, such as a provider at Planned Parenthood, to educate you on how to be more aware of any cues that the virus is flaring up. Although truly asymptomatic shedding does occur, patients can be made more aware of how to recognize mild or nonspecific symptoms that might signal an infectious period.  Other Strategies  A healthy immune system can help keep viral infections in check. While there are a lot of dietary supplements out there that claim to “boost” immunity , there actually aren’t any magic bullets to ensure a strong immune system. The best things you can do to boost your immunity are to quit smoking , eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and avoid stress.  Some conditions, like an HIV infection or receiving chemotherapy for cancer, can compromise the immune system, which can make it more difficult for your body to control a herpes infection.   Planned Parenthood health centers have condoms, can diagnose and treat herpes, offer patient education on herpes symptoms and transmission, and can help you decide if herpes medications are right for you.

So an even less than 1 in 1,000 chance if one person is on meds?  What’s the big deal then?    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 19, 2014 at 11:00 pm  said:    Those numbers are per sex act, so depending on how often a couple has sex, the chances per year would be much higher. The risk might be acceptable to some, unacceptable to others.  Here’s the relevant paragraph from the New England Journal of Medicine:  The median number of sexual contacts per couple during the study was 49 in the valacyclovir group and 46 in the placebo group (range, 0 to 482). The frequency of genital HSV-2 acquisition increased with the reported frequency of sexual activity and was 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of valacyclovir recipients, as compared with 0.68 per 1000 sexual contacts among the susceptible partners of placebo recipients. The respective rates of acquisition among susceptible women were 0.60 and 1.27 per 1000 sexual contacts and, among susceptible men, 0.23 and 0.35 per 1000 sexual contacts.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 20, 2014 at 1:03 am  said:    So, take this with a grain of salt, as I haven’t taken my biostats classes yet, but I believe these numbers would translate to a 3.07% chance of a female catching herpes from a male after 52 sex acts (say after a year of having sex once a week on average), while a male would have a 1.19% chance of catching herpes from his female partner after 52 sex acts, assuming the person with herpes was taking valacyclovir.  I used this cheat sheet , where the herpes was represented by 52 lottery tickets. T=1000, W=0.6 or W=0.23, and P=52. Take it with a grain of salt as I’m not a statistician!    Reply ↓           John C. on October 9, 2014 at 7:08 am  said:    Ann,  I believe the cheat sheet you used for your calculations would not  be the proper one to use for this example.  You are also using 52 for sex acts based on once a week.  If you were using this number, your number for W would be much less as .6 and .35 are based on 1000 sex acts.  Based on the numbers from the report, to me at least, its saying that for every 1000 sex acts for women susceptible to HSV-2, .6 women contracted the disease when their partner was on Valtrax while 1.27 women contracted it when their partner was not on Valtrax.  If you put this into a percentage, this means .6/1000 and 1.27/1000 for women and .23/1000 and .35/1000 are the only formulas you would need to use.  If it indeed cuts down viral shedding by up to 94%, that is a major factor in the reduction in transmission.  What the report doesn’t say though, is whether the couples abstained during outbreaks.  Now you add condoms to the mix, and its even lower.  I know people that have been on suppressive therapy for years and have not had any outbreaks during that entire time.  Most people who transmit the disease do not know they have it, therefore they are not taking medication to help control it.  I do believe a cure is on the way for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 as they have now determined what causes Herpes to go into latency in both versions of the disease which makes it impossible to kill.  Once a drug can be created and tested that will bring all herpes cells out of hibernation, it can be killed using the same drugs used for suppressive therapy.  Think of it as one massive outbreak bringing the condition to an end.  Its still a ways off due to lack of funding for clinical trials, but search for Duke University and University of Florida herpes research to learn more about this discovery.

If your girlfriend has an HSV-2 infection in her genital region, it can only be transmitted via contact with her genital region — not by kissing. The herpes virus doesn’t hang out in the blood. (According to Ask Alice , small amounts of virus might enter the bloodstream during the first herpes outbreak. So if your girlfriend has had HSV-2 for a while, you don’t have to worry about even that small possibility.)  According to the Red Cross , people with herpes can donate blood: “Chlamydia, venereal warts (human papilloma virus), or genital herpes are not a cause for deferral if you are feeling healthy and well and meet all other eligibility requirements.”    Reply ↓           karen on July 11, 2015 at 1:41 am  said:    Of the 267 Women 9 got it during the study period.  That suggests in active couple that woman likely have 3% chance of getting it after a sustained time period and sexual encounters.  I’d also suspect the results would be in the double digits if we were talking about a couple where they both didn’t know that one of them has it.  The risk is real over time but not a deal breaker if you think the person is the “one”.  Does suggest not to be too casual and have repeated acts with someone that you don’t deem to have long term relationship potential.  >> Participants A total of 528 monogamous couples discordant for HSV-2 infection, including an HSV-2–susceptible population of 261 men and 267 women.

I felt like my life had ended and was worried because we had broken up and I had sex with a new partner while I was on the last day of my period . After I was diagnosed I was paranoid I had passed the virus to my new partner but I had not. We have been having safe sex whilst I have no symptoms of an outbreak and everything has been gud until now. I was again on my last day of my period and we had unprotected sex in the shower with the water running and within less than 3hours of intercourse my parter started complaining about discomfort. Based on my research it says the virus cannot be passed on via the blood but I am concerned the only time my virus seems to b passing on is during my period.  We are going to the doctor tomorrow and I’m praying that he hasn’t contracted the virus from me .    Reply ↓         Anna C. on December 18, 2015 at 2:19 pm  said:    Herpes can be transmitted even when no symptoms are present, because the virus can be “shed” from your body without symptoms. However, some things can “trigger” the virus, including menstruation . To reduce risk of transmitting the virus to your partner, it’s important to use condoms each and every time, in combination with other risk-reducing strategies like medications (acyclovir).  Good luck, and the doctor should be able to answer your questions. Make sure to write them down first, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting to ask.

Because HSV-2 can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, you can pass the virus to your wife during sex. Condoms will reduce the risk but are limited by how much skin they cover. If she has HSV-1 she has some , but not complete, protection from symptoms of an HSV-2 infection. Has your wife had a blood test for HSV-2? It’s possible she already has it, but never got symptoms. Most people with HSV-1 or HSV-2 don’t get symptoms.    Reply ↓         married couple on December 26, 2015 at 9:56 am  said:    Yes she’s been tested and she is negative.

But probably the best thing to do is to talk to a qualified health care provider for advice on whether you should start using condoms or taking suppressive medication. It also depends on how your wife feels about the possibility of getting HSV-2. Some people are willing to take the risk.

Unfortunately, it’s often impossible to know where an HSV infection came from. It also depends on how you found out about your HSV infection — did you have an outbreak that was confirmed as herpes, or did you have a blood test that showed you had been exposed to HSV? Most people will test positive for HSV-1 on a blood test, but if they don’t have symptoms they can’t know for sure if the infection is located in their facial area, genital area, or both. If you decide to tell your ex-boyfriend, you might find some of these tips helpful.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on February 28, 2016 at 9:00 pm  said:    Suppressive therapy dramatically reduces risk of HSV transmission, and there is less risk of transmission when symptoms are not present, but it is still possible to transmit HSV even when you have no symptoms and are on anti-herpes medications. Someone with an HSV-1 infection in the genitals might not have as severe symptoms if later infected in the genitals with HSV-2, though it is possible to be infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the same part of the body. You and your wife will have to decide what level of risk you’re OK with, and might want to talk to a knowledgeable doctor to get all of your questions answered. Good luck!

You would need to ask your health-care provider to look at your medical records to answer your specific questions, but most STD screening does not include blood tests for herpes, so it’s possible you hadn’t been tested until now. Also, since most people get HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) in childhood, most of us will test positive for it.

Reply ↓         Anna C. on April 1, 2016 at 3:10 pm  said:    Whether to disclose herpes status is a question that a lot of people have when first learning of their diagnosis, especially when they learn how common herpes is despite being stigmatized. People can reduce risk of transmitting the virus to a partner by taking FDA-approved herpes medications such as acyclovir, which decreases the amount of virus that a person can “shed” from their body. While this type of medication can be used along with other risk-reducing methods, like abstinence during outbreaks and condoms or dental dams during other sexual contact, it does not reduce the risk to zero.  However, healthy relationships are built on trust, and talking about HIV/STD status is an important conversation for people to have when first getting together. It might be a difficult conversation, but it’s an important one for all sexually active people to learn to do, regardless of their own HIV/STD status. It is a time to talk about health, boundaries, and what activities you’re into. Disclosing your status can be one part of a larger, and very important, conversation that can help form the foundation of a healthy relationship.

The best way to avoid transmission is to practice abstinence during outbreaks (until a week after sores have healed), to take anti-herpes medications, and to use condoms. Communication is also important. Your guy can decide for himself what risks he is comfortable taking, and he can also get a blood test (if he hasn’t already) to find out if he is already a carrier for either type of herpes. Most people have HSV-1, and HSV-2 is also very common, though the vast majority of people who have it don’t know it, because they never have symptoms.  Please don’t feel disgusting! You are not defined by the viruses in your cells. Everyone has viruses — they are a fact of life — but society chooses to view certain viruses as taboo. It is so unfortunate that so many of us are made to feel shame for our STD status. Shame doesn’t help anyone. Good luck!

Now, I have read a lot on the internet about infected people taking Valtrex as suppressive therapy to reduce the risk of transmission to healthy individuals, but what I would like to know is, what if *I* (HSV-free) choose to take valacyclovir to prevent my chance of getting infected from *her*? I could not find anything online to address the chance of contracting HSV from a known infected person if the *healthy* person decides to take the medication to lower their risk of infection. Any information would be appreciated.    Reply ↓         Anna C. on May 14, 2016 at 3:49 pm  said:    Hi Jeff! It’s a good question, but I’m unaware of any studies on using acyclovir to prevent HSV acquisition in people who don’t have the virus. Using Google, I found this webpage , which says that no research has been performed to answer this question (I’ve never heard of that website and don’t necessarily endorse it). Using PubMed, I wasn’t able to find any article addressing the question either. I did find an article assessing the effectiveness of a different drug (not acyclovir) in protecting HSV-negative people from acquiring the virus — while it had encouraging results, I don’t think this drug has been well-studied as pre-exposure prophylaxis either, but it’s worth a closer look.  The thing is, you would need a doctor to prescribe the acyclovir, and if you’re negative for HSV-2 or don’t have symptoms for HSV-1 (which most people will test positive for), a doctor might not prescribe it — the drawbacks (e.g., cost and side effects) might not be worth the benefits (e.g., avoiding HSV-2 acquisition, which is not a proven benefit). A good thing for sexual partners to do before getting together is to discuss their STD status, and go in for testing together. As I said in my reply to another comment to this post, healthy relationships are built on trust, and having “the talk” about your status is an important conversation to learn how to have. It may be a difficult conversation, but it can serve as an opportunity to talk not just about health, but also about boundaries, likes, dislikes, etc. Good communication is the foundation for healthy relationships, whether they are long-term or short-term.

We had a great talk about it, where she told me and I told her I would love to keep seeing her. But I am so new to this where as I only remember education from school. Protected sex thus far. But what about when she gives me oral sex, how high are risks? And what about sleeping throughout the night with no clothes on and “spoon” as we typically do? What about foreplay like using my hands and such? And last, what about towels that have her bodily fluids on them? Reading this article and the comments and replays have helped tremendously. Sorry if any of these questions are stupid, but I feel the more educated we are the better the relationship.

Even if you broke up with him to “spare” him from getting the virus from you, chances are that his next girlfriend would have the virus that causes cold sores as well. This seems like a decision for him to make on his own. Find some good information on cold sores to share with him so his decision can be informed. Good luck!

HSV-1 is usually associated with cold sores, and most people get it when they’re children, but it can easily be spread to the genitals by oral sex. Since HSV-1 is incredibly common (even in people who never get cold sores), the chances are high that your current husband already has HSV-1. If you tell your husband about your diagnosis, you can make sure to share all the important facts with him — the World Health Organization has an excellent webpage about herpes simplex virus.  If the doctor who diagnosed you with HSV-1 can’t answer your questions, you can make an appointment at a Planned Parenthood health center to talk to someone very well-versed in sexual health. Make sure you write all your questions down so you don’t forget them. Good luck!

Parameters are what we are ultimately seeking to discover in science. If you roll the dice in a specific way from a specific starting position you will always roll a 4. That is better than saying I have a 0.2 percent chance of contacted a disease this week. I know darn well that if there is oozing slime landing in my mouth I am pretty much gonna get infected.  For the love of reality, please give some more details on the virus. I think we all would benefit from more parameters about this virus.I am asking for something more quantitative:  Can you provide average and maximum lifetime of herpes virus in the blood? Can you provide some information on what maximum and minimum temperature will inactive/kill herpes virus and the amount of time required?  I am asking because I am tired of getting information that doesn’t help me. I am represented by parameters not statistics. Parameters represent the reality. Statistics represents everything we can’t fully describe yet but generalizes. In an age when we all want to believe we are exceptional and we all try to consume ourselves into being better than our neighbors can you provide some more scientific details.

Since it is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, condoms are limited by how much skin they can cover. Lambskin condoms are not recommended for STD prevention, as they are porous and can allow viruses through (viruses are smaller than sperm).    Reply ↓         Terry on April 6, 2018 at 2:40 am  said:    Hi Anna I had no idea that lambskin condoms were less effective. I tried them some years back and found them much more sensitive and satisfying than latex. Having said that they are much more fiddling as they do not have a reservoir tip to collect the cum. I have used them sometimes for anal but not every time. Back to latex for me.    Reply ↓           Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

Most people with the virus don’t have symptoms. Even without signs of the disease, herpes can still be spread to sex partners.

Genital herpes is an STD caused by two types of viruses. The viruses are called herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).  What is oral herpes?  Oral herpes is usually caused by HSV-1 and can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes were infected during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva.  Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?  Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can be spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex . This is why some cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-1.  How common is genital herpes?  Genital herpes is common in the United States. More than one out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.  How is genital herpes spread?  You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the disease.  If you do not have herpes, you can get infected if you come into contact with the herpes virus in:   A herpes sore;  Saliva (if your partner has an oral herpes infection) or genital secretions (if your partner has a genital herpes infection);  Skin in the oral area if your partner has an oral herpes infection, or skin in the genital area if your partner has a genital herpes infection.   You can get herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or who may not know he or she is infected. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a sex partner who has oral herpes.  You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools, or from touching objects around you such as silverware, soap, or towels. If you have additional questions about how herpes is spread, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.    How can I reduce my risk of getting genital herpes?  The only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:   Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an STD (e.g., a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results);  Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex.   Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that are covered by a latex condom. Also, herpes virus can be released (shed) from areas of the skin that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.  If you are in a relationship with a person known to have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting genital herpes if:   Your partner takes an anti-herpes medication every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her doctor.  You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., when your partner is having an outbreak).    I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?  If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, it is very important for you to go to prenatal care visits. Tell your doctor if you have ever had symptoms of, or have been diagnosed with, genital herpes. Also tell your doctor if you have ever been exposed to genital herpes. There is some research that suggests that genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage, or could make it more likely for you to deliver your baby too early.  Herpes infection can be passed from you to your unborn child before birth but is more commonly passed to your infant during delivery. This can lead to a potentially deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting herpes during pregnancy. If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, you may be offered anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes at the time of delivery. At the time of delivery, your doctor should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have herpes symptoms at delivery, a ‘C-section’ is usually performed.  How do I know if I have genital herpes?  Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms, or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people who have herpes do not know it.  Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. These symptoms are sometimes called “having an outbreak.” The first time someone has an outbreak they may also have flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, or swollen glands.  People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if they are infected with HSV-2. Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although the infection stays in the body for the rest of your life, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.  You should be examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms or if your partner has an STD or symptoms of an STD. STD symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when urinating, or (for women) bleeding between periods.  How will my doctor know if I have herpes?  Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at your symptoms. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. In certain situations, a blood test may be used to look for herpes antibodies. Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask whether you should be tested for herpes or other STDs.  Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or how long you have been infected.  Can herpes be cured?  There is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. One of these anti-herpes medicines can be taken daily, and makes it less likely that you will pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).  What happens if I don’t get treated?  Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.  If you touch your sores or the fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another part of your body, such as your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, immediately wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading your infection.  If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your developing fetus, or newborn baby. See “ I’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby? ” above for information about this.  Can I still have sex if I have herpes?  If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) and let him or her know that you do and the risk involved. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.  You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your overall health, sex life, and relationships. It is best for you to talk to a health care provider about those concerns, but it also is important to recognize that while herpes is not curable, it can be managed with medication. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) for herpes can also lower your risk of spreading genital herpes to your sex partner. Be sure to discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider. Since a genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships, it is important to understand how to talk to sexual partners about STDs .  What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?  Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, having genital herpes increases the number of CD4 cells (the cells that HIV targets for entry into the body) found in the lining of the genitals. When a person has both HIV and genital herpes, the chances are higher that HIV will be spread to an HIV-uninfected sex partner during sexual contact with their partner’s mouth, vagina, or rectum.

Genital Herpes is an STD caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2, although, mostly caused by HSV-2. Genital herpes is a contagious viral infection affecting primarily the genitals of men and women. Genital herpes is characterized by recurrent clusters of vesicles and lesions at the genital areas or below the waist. The female genital areas are on or near the pubis, vulva, labia, clitoris, buttocks or rectum.
    The areas for male genital herpes include on or around the penis, the inner thigh, buttocks, or rectum. Proctitis, or inflammation of the rectum, can be due to HSV. A person usually gets HSV-2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection. Transmission may occur even if there is no visible outbreak if the infected person is shedding . 80 percent of people don't even know they have it. In the United States alone, there are about 500,000 new cases of genital herpes infections annually. While generally not dangerous, it is a nuisance and can be emotionally traumatic, as there is no cure.  The number of HSV-1 genital herpes infections is rising. It is no longer the rule that HSV-1 is above the waist. If you receive unprotected oral sex from someone infected with cold sores, you can contract HSV-1 on your genitals. Do not give oral sex if you have an active cold sore or if you are feeling the prodromal symptoms .   Red Marine Algae and VIR-L-Lysine can help to suppress genital herpes outbreaks!      Facts About Genital Herpes:    Transmission is caused by close oral, anal, or genital contact, including intercourse, masturbation, kissing, or any direct skin-to-skin contact which allows for the transfer of bodily fluids.  A person is considered contagious when prodromal symptoms, active sores, and healing lesions are present.  Herpes is potentially contagious when no symptoms are present. That is, a person who has genital herpes is potentially always shedding active virus.  Approximately 1 in 6 members of the general infected population is thought to shed active virus occasionally without symptoms.  Some people do not get typical blister-like sores but harbor active virus in their saliva, vaginal, or penile secretions, and can shed the virus without knowing they have herpes.  Lesions can occur deep inside the vagina where they cannot be seen or felt, but can readily transmit the virus.  An uninfected individual has about a 75% chance of contracting herpes during intimate contact with someone actively shedding virus.  Oral herpes can be transmitted to the genitals, and vice versa. Symptoms are similar.  Auto-inoculation: An infected individual can spread the virus to other parts of his or her body by touching an area shedding virus and then touching, scratching, or rubbing another susceptible part of the body. Towels are especially conducive to this.  It is possible for a person to contract genital herpes if the partner with oral herpes performs oral sex. Oral herpes can be transmitted to the genitals, and vice versa. Symptoms are similar.  Environmental surfaces like toilet seats may be a source of contagion, but there is no evidence that this poses a real threat to the general population. Experts differ as to how long the virus can survive on its own. The primary cause of infection remains intimate contact.    Theory of Cause: ...Dr. C.N. Look  Herpes simplex viruses include two distinct but closely related viruses, namely, HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both viruses can cause genital herpes. Roughly speaking, HSV-2 causes 90% and HSV-1 causes 10% of all genital herpes. Herpes simplex virus is a linear double-stranded DNA virus. HSV-1 and HSV-2 share approximately 50% homology of their genetic materials and they even express type-common surface antigens. It accounts for the high degree of cross-reactivity and the technical difficulty in differentiating the 2 viruses. On the other hand, HSV-1 & HSV-2 antibodies offer some degree of cross protection. Cell-mediated immune responses is more important than humoral responses in determining the severity of HSV infections. Hence, AIDS patients often have chronic and severe anogenital herpes. Genital herpes is usually transmitted by sexual intercourse. Direct inoculation of virus occurs through contact with infected secretions or mucosal surfaces. Orogenital contact with a partner with type 1 herpes labialis can also result in genital herpes. Asymptomatic shedding of HSV is the most common mode of transmission of genital herpes infection. It is estimated that more than half of the HSV-2 genital infections are asymptomatic.
