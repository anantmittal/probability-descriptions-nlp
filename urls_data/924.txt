She wasn’t having any problems now, but our dentist said trouble could flare up unexpectedly in the middle of the semester, perhaps in the middle of exams, and then she would probably have to leave school to get the teeth pulled. Better to do it now, he said. Each year, despite the risks of any surgical procedure, millions of healthy, asymptomatic wisdom teeth are extracted from young patients in the United States, often as they prepare to leave for college. Many dental plans cover the removal of these teeth, which have partly grown in or are impacted below the gum. But scientific evidence supporting the routine prophylactic extraction of wisdom teeth is surprisingly scant, and in some countries the practice has been abandoned. “Everybody is at risk for appendicitis , but do you take out everyone’s appendix?” said Dr. Greg J. Huang, chairman of orthodontics at the University of Washington in Seattle. “I’m not against removing wisdom teeth, but you should do an assessment and have a good clinical reason.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Oral surgeons have long argued that if you don’t have your wisdom teeth removed at a young age, you are simply postponing the inevitable.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “It’s hard to get a percentage, but probably 75 to 80 percent of people do not meet the criteria of being able to successfully maintain their wisdom teeth,” said Dr. Louis K. Rafetto of Wilmington, Del., who headed the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons ’ task force on wisdom teeth. Another expert, Dr. Raymond P. White Jr., a professor of surgery at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry , said that roughly 60 to 70 percent of patients with wisdom teeth will eventually have trouble with them, but he acknowledged that data is limited. “We’re making decisions based on the best data we have,” he said. Those persuasive numbers are used repeatedly by dentists and oral surgeons to justify routine removal of wisdom teeth. Just last year, the surgeons’ association issued a statement subtitled “Keeping Wisdom Teeth May Be More Harmful Than Previously Thought,” saying it was imperative that patients understood “how harmful retaining these wisdom teeth can be.” The association said that 80 percent of young adults who retained previously healthy wisdom teeth developed problems within seven years, and that retained wisdom teeth are extracted up to 70 percent of the time. Yet when asked, the association was not able to produce the evidence for these figures. “We were not able to locate the reference for it, and subsequently deleted the statement from our Web site,” Janice Teplitz, the group’s associate executive director of communications, said last week. As of Monday, however, the association’s Web site still said that “ between 25 percent and almost 70 percent ” of the time, retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth “are eventually extracted.” Many studies suggest that the actual number of people who have trouble with their wisdom teeth is far lower.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Oral surgeons warn that even when young people are not experiencing pain or discomfort, they may have infection or inflammation; numerous studies have found that adults who keep their wisdom teeth tend to have more such problems over time than those who have them removed . But there does not appear to be a single randomized clinical trial — the gold standard for scientific proof — comparing similar patients who have and have not undergone prophylactic wisdom teeth removal.  Photo         Credit Stuart Goldenberg    Our dentist warned us that cysts and tumors could grow around impacted wisdom teeth. But a new study of more than 6,000 patients in Greece found that only 2.7 percent of the teeth had a cyst or tumor . An older study, often cited by critics of routine extraction, found that only 12 percent of 1,756 middle-aged people who had not had impacted wisdom teeth removed experienced a complication . Numerous comprehensive reviews of research, conducted by independent bodies not affiliated with oral surgeons, have concluded that there was no evidence to support routine prophylactic extraction of impacted but healthy wisdom teeth. Britain’s National Health Service stopped paying for the procedure if there was no good reason for it after an analysis by its Center for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York concluded in 1998 that there was no solid scientific evidence to support it . Also that year, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh said that for patients who do not have a condition related to third molars or whose teeth would probably grow in successfully, removal is “not advisable.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The group also said there is “reliable evidence” that suggests that removing wisdom teeth does not prevent or reduce crowding of front teeth. In 2008, the American Public Health Association dismissed arguments typically made for removing wisdom teeth : that adjacent teeth might be damaged, or that the teeth may harbor bacteria that cause periodontal disease. The association approved a policy saying these concerns do not justify the risks of surgery, which include possible nerve damage, complications from anesthesia . loss of the sense of taste and, very rarely, death. “The few studies of long-term retention of impacted teeth have shown little risk of harm,” the association concluded. So given what all agree is a lack of good evidence, how should consumers proceed when a dentist suggests removing healthy wisdom teeth? IF EXTRACTION IS RECOMMENDED All surgery carries risks, and you should try to ensure that there is something to be gained from having your wisdom teeth removed. Ask what the reason is in your case. Is there a chance the wisdom teeth will grow in successfully? If you see a dentist on a regular basis, is watchful waiting an option?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If you have an infection or inflammation, ask about less-invasive treatment. The general consensus among critics of routine extraction is that recurrent gum infection, or pericoronitis; irreparable tooth decay ; an abscess ; cysts; tumors; damage to nearby teeth and bone; or other pathological conditions justify the procedure. IF YOU CHOOSE SURGERY Most dental plans cover at least some of the costs of extraction. If you don’t have dental insurance, pulling all four teeth may cost several thousand dollars. Ask if you can have local anesthesia, which is considered safer than general anesthesia. Follow postoperative instructions carefully. Avoid being very active or eating solid food for three to four days (instead try noodles and milkshakes). Keeping ice on the jaw may help with pain and swelling . Painkillers may be needed. Young patients tend to recover sooner than older patients. IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST EXTRACTION Good dental hygiene will be even more important for you. The teeth in the back of the mouth are often harder to reach and clean well. Get frequent cleanings, and X-rays if necessary. Smoking increases the risk of periodontal disease, as does diabetes . If you have cavities in your back molars, you may be at greater risk for problems with the wisdom teeth. As for my daughter Emma, we have opted for watchful waiting. She went off to college last month, wisdom teeth and all.

Prev  NEXT            Praying that the third molars won't form  Holloway/Riser/ Getty Images       For many of us, it may seem like our wisdom teeth didn't get the memo that our evolved jaws are lacking space. But some people never develop wisdom teeth; in fact, these teeth don't appear in about 35 percent of the population [source: Spinney ]. Are we on an evolutionary track to losing them altogether?  Some experts say it's possible these teeth will eventually disappear [sources: Flam , Usbourne ]. Still, there are a few unknowns in the equation. Scientists aren't sure of the role that DNA plays in creating teeth at the third molar position [source: Colf ]. Third molars develop entirely after birth, the only teeth to do so. Because these teeth aren't present at birth, it may be harder for nature to select against them [source: LePage ]. For wisdom teeth to form, the tissue that starts the process of tooth building has to migrate back in the mouth to interact with the back jaw tissue. If this migration doesn't happen, then no tooth will grow there.            ­  There may also be some environmental factors at work, including disease or head trauma, that stop the tissue migration [source: Silvestri, Singh ]. It could also come down to differences in how various cultures use their jaws. For example, in the 1970s, researchers tied the larger jaw that was present in Eskimo women to their tradition of chewing leather to soften it. In parts of East Asia, it's more common to find people with fewer wisdom teeth, if any [source: Vines ]. If people of a culture have reached the point where they don't use a trait, they may lose it.  But some scientists are beginning work on stopping the teeth from appearing altogether, so that we might bioengineer these teeth out of existence before evolution does it for us. Because there's a window of time in which there's no third molar, it might be possible to administer a laser or a chemical agent that would prevent the tooth growth. Preliminary studies have shown some success in dogs and rats [source: Silvestri, Singh ].  Currently, the lack of wisdom teeth doesn't produce any great evolutionary advantage, particularly with the abundance of oral surgeons who can remove the wisdom teeth that do emerge. That makes it hard to say exactly how the trait might adapt in the future. Certainly, oral surgeons probably have their fingers crossed that these teeth continue to appear for a good long while. The rest of us will have to make do with lots of ice cream and the continuous exchange of surgery stories. Sure, those wisdom tooth lackers may claim they're more highly evolved because they don't have to go through a few days of misery, but what do they talk about at boring parties?   Should They Stay or Should They Go?  Wisdom tooth extraction is expensive, and recovering from the surgery is no easy feat, considering that pain, bleeding, swelling, infection and nerve injury are but a few of the complications. Still, removing wisdom teeth is recommended by many dentists to avoid the pain and periodontal disease that results from an impacted tooth. The surgery should be done during young adulthood, before the teeth attach to the jaw and become too difficult to extract.  ­  In 2007, however, dentist Jay W. Friedman claimed in the American Journal of Public Health that at least two-thirds of wisdom tooth extractions are unnecessary [source: Friedman]. He and some other dentists argue that these teeth will come in at the proper position and cause no trouble. These dentists say that instead of simply doing preventative removals for most young people, we should only remove wisdom teeth that are impacted. Other dentists say that these teeth are still difficult to clean and should be removed.              1  2  3  4  NEXT       Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint      Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint                     More to Explore          Related Content          " "       Why are some animals harder to clone than others?

Credit: Carlos Caetano | Shutterstock     BOSTON — Many people have suffered from impacted third molars, also known as wisdom teeth. But there are also a lucky few who are missing a wisdom tooth or two (or even all four). Why do some people have wisdom teeth, while others don't?  The answer, partly hinted at in new research presented here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , could also explain why particular ethnic groups, such as the Inuit, have a particularly low occurrence of wisdom teeth.  Some thousands of years ago, a random mutation arose which suppressed the formation of wisdom teeth, a trait that then spread and now accounts for the lack of wisdom teeth among some modern humans, said Princeton University researcher Alan Mann.  The oldest fossils missing third molars hail from China and are about 300,000 to 400,000 years old, suggesting the first mutation may have arisen there, Mann told LiveScience.  Like most mammals, humans' ancestors had four sets of three molars (for a total of 12, with six in both the upper and lower jaw) used to help chew and grind food. Unlike other mammals, however, humans underwent a period of evolution in which the brain greatly expanded in size , Mann said. This created an architectural problem; with a much larger brain case, the jaw had to become narrower so that it could still connect to the lower part of the skull, Mann said.  Genes that control the quantity of teeth, however, evolve independently from those that control brain development, Mann's research has shown. This led to a mismatch, in which the human jaw was no longer large enough, in many cases, to give wisdom teeth room to erupt through the gums.  Impacted third molars (teeth that do not make it out of the gums) can become infected, leading to serious health problems. Even more commonly, however, wisdom teeth cause severe pain . This fact alone could help explain how the lack of wisdom teeth evolved, Mann said: The pain could make one less likely to reproduce. That would favor people with the mutation, who would suffer less pain, he added. [ Top 10 Useless Limbs (and Other Vestigial Organs) ]  "Imagine a scenario where one evening a person is in serious pain from an impacted third molar," Mann said. "Their partner comes up and says, 'How about a bout of reproduction?' And the person says, 'Not tonight, dear, my jaws are killing me.'"  Perhaps 10 to 25 percent of Americans of European ancestry are missing at least one third molar, Mann said. For African Americans and Asian Americans, the figure is 11 percent and 40 percent, respectively, he said. But the Inuit, a group of people who live in the Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland and Alaska, have the fewest wisdom teeth ; about 45 percent of them lack one or more third molar, he said.  There are probably a couple reasons for this. For one, this group originated in Asia, where the oldest fossils lacking wisdom teeth were found, Mann said. Secondly, like other Asians, the Inuit tend to have flatter faces (when compared to Europeans and Africans), meaning they have even narrower jaws, leaving less room for teeth, he said. Third, Inuit teeth also tend to be larger than average, meaning that this mutation would be even more advantageous in this population, Mann said.   Reach Douglas Main at dmain@techmedianetwork.com .

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Wisdom Teeth  Teeth  Dental Hygiene  Dentistry What is the percentage of people that get their wisdom teeth removed? Dent de sagesse Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers   Greg Ceyhan , Dentist with Aesthetic Dentistry of Arrowhead Answered Apr 24, 2014 Many people that come through a dentists office have their wisdom teeth removed. It's been speculated that wisdom teeth, or the third molars, have become obsolete and that the human mouth has become too small to support all 32 teeth, with the high numbers of impactions and crowding caused by the wisdom teeth in dental patients. Even those whose wisdom teeth grow in without any issues find that these teeth have a high chance of disease and cavities that cause the teeth to need to be removed at some point in the future. Many dentists have actually begun removing wisdom teeth as a routine procedure due to the high rate of retained wisdom teeth needed to be extracted within the next 7 seven years. Actual numbers on how many people get their wisdom teeth removed have been hard to come by, with even the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons not coming up with any concrete numbers, but estimates range between 60 and 85% of people having one or more wisdom teeth removed, and up to 80% of those who initially retain their wisdom teeth needing to have them removed at a later time. 10.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Dent de sagesse Percentage is very high, shall we say around 80%. However, bear in mind that quite a number of wisdom teeth were and are removed not because they are impacted, semi-impacted, or pushing at the second molars but because they need to be removed because of extensive caries or parodontopathy. In fact, main fact in prosthetics is that all dental surgeons should keep the most posterior teeth because they’re essential for prosthetic rehabilitation. Therefore, in my dental days I used to remove many teeth and the main reason for removal of wisdom teeth were: not erupted; or partially erupted; pushing on second molars causing pain and caries; infection under the mucosal flap (pericoronitis); but the main reason percentage-wise was large caries, parodontal abscess, apical granuloma or abscess, parodontopathy. 771 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions Why is it so bad to remove wisdom teeth at home?

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery  Wisdom Teeth  Dental Hygiene  Dentistry What are the chances of nerve damage from wisdom teeth removal? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers   Dr Manmohan Bramta , MDS Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Sardar Patel Institute of Dental Sciences (2008) Answered Apr 18, 2017 In case of upper wisdom teeth there are almost nil chances for any nerve damage Mandibular/Lower wisdom teeth are usually in close proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve which runs in mandibular canal innervating mandibular teeth, gums, and chin. The chances of nerves damage to this nerve is determined by an Intra Oral Peri Apical X-ray or a panaromic view (OPG). These X-rays give us a approximate relation of the tooth with the canal/nerve, and based on this analysis we can tell. A qualified Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, will always keep in mind this proximity of nerve to tooth and remove the third molar accordingly, however mild injury to the nerve is not uncommon. In case of mild injury, patient only has mild discomfort in form of parasthesia/loss of sensation in lower lip, which heals in a few days to weeks. Another nerve that can be damaged during wisdom tooth removal is lingual nerve. But now the incidence of damage to this nerve is very low because of improvement and evolution of wisdom tooth removal techniques which prefer usage of a drill rather than chisel and mallet. To summarise, the incidence of nerve damage is relatively very low, such that it should not be a criteria for you not to go for its removal. 902 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

Complications from leaving infection-prone wisdom teeth can also kill you. If you know you have heart problems you must inform your oral surgeon. As for your fear, your oral surgeon should discuss the risks of taking them out vs. leaving them in so you understand which one to fear more. Let him/her know about your anxiety and they can help you with medication. The procedure itself will be a non-event as you will probably be in la-la land with IV sedation. The post-op will be controlled with medication for pain for your comfort. I WOULD SUGGEST MAKING SURE YOUR DOCTOR IS AVAILABLE DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY.

If you think you have heart problems get it checked out by your GP and then potentially by a referring cardiologist. Wisdom teeth extraction sounds horrible but it really is nothing to be worried about. Of course there will be some discomfort after the extraction but people can manage fine with prescribed pain killers and good post operation care. Expect some swelling as it is normal, make sure you stay well rested after the extraction. Stay home and watch movies or read books to keep you occupied.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery  Wisdom Teeth  Dentists  Teeth  Dental Hygiene  Dentistry  Health  Medicine and Healthcare How painful is it to have your wisdom tooth extracted? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 14 Answers   John Jay , DDS  Dentistry & Bloggers, UCLA School of Dentistry (2005) Updated Jan 16, 2017 I actually haven’t had own wisdom teeth pulled but I have removed countless wisdom teeth throughout my career. To say that there is no pain whatsoever is not really true. However if you and your dentist pay attention and follow protocol then it can be quite an easy procedure. Here are factors you and your dentist must pay attention to if you’re planning on removing your wisdom teeth without being put to asleep ( click here for full article ) Distinguishing pain versus pressure No matter how numb your dentist makes your teeth, you will still feel pressure in the region. The reason is because there are different nerve receptors for pain as opposed to pressure. Conventional anesthesia, what you refer to as Novocaine, only numbs pain receptors and not pressure sensors. It’s very difficult to distinguish the difference between the two if you haven’t had a tooth pulled before so let me use a demonstration: Grab your front tooth and tug at it. This is what pressure feels like. Now poke at your gums with you nails of some other sharp object. This is what pain feels like. Distinguishing between pain and pressure is very important when it comes to wisdom removal surgery. You should expect lots of pressure but no actual pain if you’re numbed up properly. Should you feel actual pain then communicate with your dentist or oral surgeon right away to receive more numbing agent. However, if you get scared and keep insisting that you’re feeling pain when it’s actually pressure, then it’s not going to go well. There’s only so many shots you can safely receive, particularly when removing multiple wisdom teeth. Insisting on more and more shots could raise your blood pressure to dangerously high levels and compromise your health. The more pain you have coming in with, the more difficult it will be to numb your tooth There is a big difference between removing wisdom teeth, or for that matter any tooth, which is actively hurting versus doing it to prevent pain. If you’re experiencing a severe toothache it will be much harder to numb your tooth. Our nerves become more sensitive when we are experiencing pain which consequently makes it much harder to numb the tooth. The more pain you have and the longer you’ve been in pain, the more difficult it will be to numb the offending tooth. For instance if you need 2 to 3 shots to numb an average wisdom tooth it now requires 4, 5 or even more shots to numb a wisdom tooth that is very painful. My advice to you is that if your wisdom teeth need to be removed then do so before they become very painful. Otherwise expect plenty of shots and you still might not get fully numb. Difficulty of tooth removal The more covered with bone (impacted) your tooth is, the more challenging removing it will be. Teeth which are all the way out are the easiest ones to remove. Teeth which are partially trapped underneath your gums start to become more difficult to remove. Those which are partially or fully underneath your jawbone are by far the most difficult ones to extract. You may or may not feel pain during surgery depending on how well your dentist or oral surgeon has numbed you, however you will definitely feel lots of pressure when removing fully impacted wisdom teeth. I usually tell my patients in advance which teeth are expected to be the hardest to remove so they are well informed and prepared. I feel this is important not just for them to know which teeth can be more difficult to remove, but also which ones will take the longest to heal. The more complicated a removal, the more damage to your jawbone and thus more pain after surgery. Location of wisdom teeth As a general rule, lower wisdom teeth are more difficult to remove so they can be more painful as well. First off, there are a lot more nerves going to your lower wisdom teeth than to the upper ones due to human anatomy. Secondly, your jawbone is much denser in the lower jaw (mandible) than it is in the upper jaw (maxilla). As a result lower wisdom teeth are generally much more difficult to remove than upper ones. To put this in perspective, it typically takes me about 5 minutes to remove an upper impacted wisdom tooth as opposed to 20 to 30 minutes for a lower impacted wisdom. Speed of your metabolism Another factor which I’ve noticed affects your pain experience during the surgery is your body’s metabolism. Metabolism not only affects how quickly your numbness kicks in but also how rapidly it wears off. This is important especially when we are removing all four wisdoms at once. If you have high metabolism then chances are by the time we reach your last tooth the numbness has already worn off. If you start to feel your numbness wearing off during surgery, immediately inform your dentist or oral surgeon and ask him or her for more Novocaine. Keep in mind that being numb is not only important throughout your surgery, but it also matters for after the procedure is completed. If your numbness wears off before you’ve had a chance to get home and take your medications, then you will experience some serious pain. So don’t be shy asking for more shots if you actually need them as it only benefits you in the end. Miscellaneous factors There was an article about how redheads feel more pain at the dentist and I had actually noticed it to be true myself. Some people, particularly very light skinned individuals, tend to be more sensitive during dental treatment, the same way they would be to sunlight for instance. Another factors that affects your experience is your threshold against anesthesia. For example if you take lots of painkillers then you may not get numb as easily and require more shots. As you can see this is not a straight forward answer. However the bottomline is if you go to an experienced dentist or oral surgeon who pays attention to details, you should be able to get numb well and not feel any pain. If this is still not enough for you, then look into options of being put to asleep.

Ask New Question   Shalini Rajendran , I eat Bhelpuri without onions :-) Answered May 26, 2014 I had wisdom tooth extraction twice. You actually won't feel any pain during the procedure as the dental surgeon will give you enough anaesthetic and only start working on your tooth once your mouth feels numb. During the extraction you will feel a lot of pressure but not pain. Once your tooth is out , surgeon will stitch that area and send you home. The pain will start in a couple of hours once the anaesthetic wears off. Yes, it will trouble you for a couple of days and you have to be very careful with your mouth , following all the instructions given carefully. They will likely ask you to be back in 5 days to remove the stitches and by then things will go back to normalcy. Chill!! 9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

You feel a very very very bad pain! I even remember myself crying. What I learned about this pain is that simply taking medicine won’t help me, I had to inject myself a painkiller called Dexalgin, 2 times per day. However, even though the pain went away I still had a “heavy” cheek, which was numb for like 5 days and it felt extremely uncomfortable, because I couldn’t move my head!

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Wisdom Teeth  Teeth  Dentistry Should I get my wisdom teeth out if they are not bothering me? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 42 Answers Quora User Answered Jun 1, 2014 · Author has 1k answers and 8.9m answer views Yes. Here's why: I waited until I was 27 and my teeth started shifting to get my wisdom teeth removed.  The pain of them coming in was totally tolerable, but my teeth were getting crowded and I didn't want to have more problems down the line. I read the longer you wait to have them removed, the more likely you are to have complications.  For me, that couldn't have been more true. The cost was somewhat more expensive for being put under, but not prohibitively so - a few hundred dollars, I think.  Worth every penny not to be in agonizing pain.  I have a so-so pain tolerance and a super high tolerance to normal anesthetics.  I once needed eight shots of novocaine for one root canal with the last two being inserted directly into the nerve. I never ever ever want to do that again. In this case, I was getting all four taken out and two of the four were all the way through, one was just barely under the gum line (I could feel it with my tongue), and the last was heading directly for my back teeth, completely hidden in the gum. I didn't feel any pain during the extractions.  It was a twilight sleep rather than intubation, so I felt very safe. When I had laser surgery at 15, they also used twilight sleep, so I was comfortable with the process.  They did give me my first ever Xanax and told me to take it an hour before I arrived.  That was the easiest IV insertion of my life. At first I was a little concerned but I just watched them put it in and thought wow, that's a little painful but whatever, duuuuuuude. They finished getting everything set up and I was out less than 15 minutes later. I was fine for the ride home and was talking and happy since the anesthesia hadn't completely worn off yet, but I was really, really drugged. Here's a short clip of the ride home so you get an idea of what it's like: I went home and took a nap and woke up crying from the pain a few hours later: The doctor gave me vicodin, but taking the maximum allowable dosage for the pain only took me to a 3/4 pain level and I ended up throwing up all the meds I took the second day because I couldn't eat much. The pain just kept getting worse. I can't even begin to explain the pain of this to you. It's like your jaw is in a giant pressure chamber and on fire at the same time. Horrible - walking around in tears for hours. Anything, including air moving through your mouth sets off the intense reaction all over again. After researching online, I suspected I had dry sockets. I contacted his office and told them so, but he still couldn't write the scrip for the hydromorphone I knew would work (I've taken it many times before for various issues) until I came back for him to examine me. I had my boyfriend drive me an hour back to see him and once he looked inside my mouth and realized I wasn't just trying to get hopped up on drugs, he wrote the prescription. Turns out I had two dry sockets. Surprise, surprise. He then told me, "yeah, I had to break a tooth in two to get it out - I'm not surprised that the area was traumatized." I asked him why he gave me such a hard time about the pain meds then. He said he just has to be really careful because it's not a normal scrip for that and blah, blah, blah. YES BUT YOU KNEW I WOULD HAVE EXTRA PAIN. Oh, well. Not my first experience with a medical professional like that, unfortunately. After that, the pain was manageable, but water started coming out of my nose every time I did the wound irrigation. Did some research myself online and realized the reason why water was coming out of my nose every time I rinsed was because I had an oral antral fistula on one of the top sockets. That basically means there was a new opening between my mouth and my sinus cavity where the tooth used to be. I was going to post a picture here, but it's pretty disgusting looking. Google it if you're interested. I called to tell him that I had the fistula and he was skeptical of my self diagnosis AGAIN. Seriously, dude? Medical professionals, please try to work with your patients - we are the  most  informed about our own bodies, not you. I went back and believe it or not, I was right. He gave me a couple shots of local anesthetic and sewed the hole up. I went back a week later and got the stitches removed. By that time, 80% of the pain had subsided and I no longer had water coming out of my nose from my mouth. Success at last! I'm not sure it gets any worse than that for wisdom tooth removal. I don't even want to imagine what it would have been like with a local anesthetic. 17.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question   Rutledge Wayne , studied at Harvard University (1902) Answered Apr 13, 2017 A lot of people when they’re early twenties or late teens go to the dentist for wisdom teeth extraction . However, this isn’t something that everyone has to have done. Even though dentists have different opinions regarding whether it’s necessary to have this done, if you’re thinking it’s a good idea to have yours removed, you should talk to your dentist. Good Reasons to Have Them Removed Even though oral surgery sounds scary, when you have them removed it can be often better in the long run than leaving them in. Because leaving them unaddressed can cause greater pain and discomfort down the road. But a lot of people don’t have any problems when their teeth break through and therefore they won’t need to have the procedure. Even with this knowledge, a lot of dental professionals make the recommendation that they have them removed if you’re having the following problems. They’re not fitting properly – Most people have room for approximately 28 teeth, and that’s the number you’ll have before the eruption of your wisdom teeth. With the addition of four more teeth, you now have 32 teeth and they’re fitting into a space that fits just 28 teeth. When your jaw isn’t big enough, those teeth can be impacted and they don’t erupt fully or they are misaligned. If this happens, having them pulled will make sure that your other teeth have enough room. You are having gum pain all the time near the wisdom teeth – The pain you are experiencing might mean you have an infection which could be happening from wisdom teeth that have been partially erupted. When bacteria and food are trapped inside these areas, it can cause a really painful infection called pericoronitis . When you have those teeth pulled, it can prevent any further infection. They’re coming in crooked – If your teeth fully come in but they’re coming in sideways, your teeth might move and shift as time goes by. There’s also a possibility that crooked teeth can harm your nearby teeth. After you’ve had the teeth pulled, you’ll have your other teeth protected. There’s a cyst around the tooth – This will happen when the sac beside the tooth fills with fluid. Anytime this happens, it may destroy any surrounding structures like tooth roots or bone. In really rare cases, untreated cysts can result in tumors that may require surgical procedures that are more serious.

Undo   Andy Green , I share oral hygiene tips Answered Jan 9, 2018 I interviewed a few different family members over thanksgiving ranging from 17 to 68 years old and it turned out only me and my mother had not had theirs removed. In my case, I still have them but have not been bothered by their presence. In my mother’s case, she never developed any which explains why they were never removed. I started looking into the purpose of third molars, or wisdom teeth, and why we remove them…or don’t. Scientists have determined that our third molars were once detrimental to the digestion of our ancestors. Because our diet consisted of course, rough foods like leaves, roots, nuts and meats which needed to be ground before swallowed, those additional teeth were need for chewing power. Naturally, with evolution, our diets began to change and so did our body. Our jaws are much smaller than they used to be, and our diet now consists of softer less nutrient rich foods. In early childhood we feed babies and children out of bottles, then sippy cups, then self-dissolving crackers, then apple sauce….you get the point. Some say they we also lack the nutrient vitamin K2 — commonly found in liver and organ meat as well as animal products from animals that eat grass, not corn or grains. This in combination with the fact we now cut our food before chewing has in turn caused our jaws to be under developed. Not only have our third molars lost their use, but they also do not have space to grow. Since we no longer have use or space for these teeth, they tend to grow in perpendicular to the healthy teeth neighboring. If the teeth begin to erupt into the roots of the adjacent teeth it will damage the healthy teeth to which point both will need removal. This is why doctors & dentist in Amherst suggest extracting wisdom teeth before any damage can be done. I have provided an x-ray of my teeth so that you can see what it looks like when there is no room for them and how close they are to teeth roots next door. Although I do not feel the need to extract them if I allow them to continue growing they may cause more damage. In my mother’s case, she is part of the 35% of humans born without wisdom teeth at all. This now brings us to the procedure itself. Not everyone will need IV sedation but it is an option my office, dental clinic in Amherst offers. Once you have an evaluation they will tell you how invasive the procedure will be and if conscious sedation is right for you. In many cases patients will only need local anesthetic. If the tooth is fully erupted the dentist will extract the tooth using forceps and/or elevators. If the tooth in impacted in the jaw and has not come through the gum, a small incision will be made in the gum and a small piece of bone will also be removed to access the tooth. The dentist will then widen the tooth socket by rocking the tooth back and forth before taking it out. The area will be numb so this will not cause any paid but the patient will feel a great deal of pressure while the dentist removes the tooth. Finally the dentist will place dissolving stiches where the incision was made, sealing the gum line. After proper care instruction is given they will send you on your way….commence embarrassing videotaping.

Most often, the reason wisdom teeth need to be removed is because there is severe inflammation of the gum in between the teeth and decay occurring in the adjacent teeth due to poor oral hygiene in the hard to reach area. If you're able to floss properly , and have no trouble reaching into the very back of your mouth to clean in between your wisdom and adjacent teeth, then it is unlikely that your wisdom teeth with cause you any problems. If the wisdom tooth is not causing any pain whatsoever, and is not causing any discomfort such as causing you to bite your cheek , then there is no emergency in taking it out. However - If the tooth is causing discomfort, is impacting other teeth, or is protruding in such a way where it affects your bite , or is causing you to bite your cheek, then it might need to be taken out, if adjustment is not possible. If adjustment is possible, there are several treatment options such as braces, Clear alignment systems such as Invisalign Orthosnap or Six Months Smiles a system which uses cosmetic braces and concentrates on correcting the alignment of the teeth.

Here’s when and why wisdom teeth has to be removed. Your wisdom teeth don’t fit in your mouth. Most of us have room for about 28 teeth, which is the number of teeth you have before your wisdom teeth erupt. When you add your four wisdom teeth, you have 32 teeth all trying to fit into the confined amount of space available in your jaw. When the jaw isn’t large enough, the wisdom teeth can become impacted, which means they are either unable to fully erupt or they become misaligned. In this case, having your wisdom teeth pulled will ensure all your teeth have ample room. You experience chronic pain in your gums near your wisdom teeth. This pain can be a sign of infection that can occur from partially erupted wisdom teeth. When food and bacteria get trapped in these areas, it can lead to a very painful infection known as pericoronitis. Having your wisdom teeth pulled in this case will prevent further infection. Your wisdom teeth don’t come in straight. If your wisdom teeth come in fully, but come in sideways, they can cause your teeth to shift and move over time. There is also a chance that poorly aligned wisdom teeth can damage the nearby teeth. Once you have your wisdom teeth pulled, your nearby teeth will be protected from damage. A cyst forms around the wisdom tooth. This occurs when the sac next to the tooth becomes filled with fluid. When this occurs, it can destroy the surrounding structures such as bone or tooth roots. In rare cases, an untreated cyst can lead to a tumor that may require a more serious surgical procedure.

Even though they may not be bothering you now, there are several reasons to undergo wisdom teeth removal before an actual problem crops up. Here is what you must consider with your dentist before you decide on what to do about your wisdom teeth: Are they causing problems for you now? Problems, meaning a cavity or soft tissue irritation that can cause incomplete mouth opening, it may not currently be an issue for you, but it can develop into a problem later. Can you clean them well? The incomplete eruption of the teeth into the mouth can create pockets of tissue that collect bacteria around your wisdom teeth. Their position at the back of your mouth can make them really hard to clean too. It is imperative that you can thoroughly clean your wisdom teeth (and the rest of your teeth) because infections involving the wisdom teeth are a leading cause of multi-space infections, which can spread to the head and neck. Are they fully out already? Due to their location and the time of the eruption, usually between age 17–25, often there is not enough room. When that happens, wisdom teeth may erupt into places where they are interfering with the normal jaw function. This interference can cause pain in the TMJ (the joint of your jaws) later on. Also, you might not be able to open your mouth completely. Any opposing tooth contacting your wisdom teeth when you bite? Not everyone has all 4 of their wisdom teeth. There are many cases where wisdom teeth grow in the mouth without a tooth in the opposite arch to come in contact with during biting. This may not seem like a problem; however, without that feedback a tooth can super-erupt (growing higher than the teeth alongside) and cause occlusal interferences. They might also rub against soft tissue and cause irritation. Is it impacted? Such situation can create soft tissue pockets, depending on the degree and direction of impaction. Not only that, the wisdom teeth can push the roots of your other good teeth causing resorption (the root disintegrates). Everyone can notice a problem when there are active symptoms. However, if there are signs of an impending problem, why wait? Another good reason to decide earlier rather than later is that the bone around your teeth will mature. This might make wisdom teeth more difficult to remove as you get older.

Wisdom teeth are third molars. These third molars will come around the age of 18 to 20 years. Wisdom teeth are no different than any other tooth except that they are the last ones to develop. They are also useful than any other tooth IF they grow properly with a proper bite relationship, along with healthy gum tissue around them. You KNOW WHAT this always does not happen, because third molars are UNPREDICTABLE . That’s why your dentist told to remove your wisdom teeth. Why should wisdom teeth be removed? Wisdom teeth erupt through the gum partly because there is no enough space in the jaw, so they are considered impacted wisdom tooth. That can gives you a decayed tooth, ulcer, TMJ problem, plaque formation and other problems. Mostly, people are unable to properly clean their teeth it can lead to periodontal disease, which can cause gum erosion, infection, and some times it lead you to a grave danger. Signs and Symptoms you should not skip seeing a dentist ? Each one’s symptoms differs, 1. Pain 2. Infection in the mouth 3. Facial swelling 4. Swelling around the gumline.

Similarly, the American Public Health Association says wisdom teeth should be extracted only in when it shows a pathology or a diseased condition. NOW ASK YOURSELF : "What's the relative benefit ?" says Richard Niederman, chairman of the department of epidemiology and health promotion and director of the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry at New York University.

If they are impacted and/or cause crowding in your teeth, a dentist will recommend that you have them removed. There are two ways wisdom teeth may grow. 1. Some will grow in like regular teeth 2. Some will become impacted. If the wisdom teeth have grown in and don’t hurt, then the decision is up to you. Wisdom teeth that cause minimal crowding and don’t hurt are fine to keep, but a lot of dentists will recommend that they be removed. Why? They are very susceptible to cavities and are not easily  cleansable. If your wisdom teeth have cavities and you cannot clean them due to their location, filling the cavities is unwise because you’ll continue to develop more cavities. The easiest way to avoid this problem is to remove the wisdom teeth altogether.

The answer for any specific person is both age and anatomy-driven With the availability of precision 3D diagnostic tools, such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), dentists now have an evidence-based method to advise patients on wisdom teeth removal. There is no longer a guessing game as patients mature into their adult anatomy. With CBCT evidence, dental radiologists and trained dentists can see the direction your wisdom teeth are headed.

But, as you have already heard, the position of the teeth may make their removal important to preserve your overall dental health. One thing that needs to be considered and had not been mentioned is the difficulty of the surgical management or the "risk-reward" of the procedure needed to remove the tooth/teeth. This needs to be determined by an OMF surgeon (oral and maxillofacial). That is the updated term for an oral surgeon.

If you are over age 25 when the impacted teeth are removed, you have a greater chance of complications (e.g., dry socket), because of the increased density and reduced flexibility of the bone. Wisdom teeth removal can be much more painful / complicated, with longer recovery times, when you get into your late 20s/30s. Good quote from the AAOMS website ( www.aaoms.org/wisdom_teeth.php): It isn't wise to wait until your wisdom teeth start to bother you. In general, earlier removal of wisdom teeth results in a less complicated healing process. The AAOMS/OMSF study strongly recommends that wisdom teeth be removed by the time the patient is a young adult in order to prevent future problems and to ensure optimal healing. The researchers found that older patients may be at greater risk for disease, including periodontitis, in the tissues surrounding the third molars and adjacent teeth. Periodontal infections, such as those observed in this study, may affect your general health. 14.8k Views · View Upvoters   Albert Sheu , works at Quora Answered Feb 10, 2010 · Author has 329 answers and 1.4m answer views From personal experience, I would remove them even in a non-emergency. When I was younger the dentist told me that I had non-impacted wisdom teeth, and so it wasn't required that I remove them. However, by the time I was 21 or so, I started getting extremely intense pain in random spots in my mouth. As it turns out, the pain was referred pain from the highly infected wisdom teeth, given that it's much harder to keep them clean. Eventually the surgeon determined that I needed to get all four out at the same time, which I finally did. I have particularly bad luck with my teeth, but it's not worth dealing with the complications. Impacted teeth are another beast in itself, and can risk other teeth to become misaligned.

Answered Dec 23, 2015 While impacted wisdom tooth does not need any treatment (if they are not causing any problems!), tooth extraction may be needed to treat the impacted wisdom tooth. Performed in a dentist’s office, this removal of wisdom tooth is usually handled by an oral surgeon.   Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics in case of infection. Often, over-the-counter pain relievers are enough to tackle the discomfort caused. Doctors also suggest gargles of warm salt water or mouthwashes that provide instant relief for impacted wisdom tooth infection.  The very first thing dentists recommend is to get the impacted teeth removed if they are causing problems. It is either performed by a dentist or an oral surgeon based on the severity of the impacted wisdom tooth infection.  While removal is apt for getting rid of all the problems, some dentists recommend the wisdom teeth should be removed in advance so that they do not result in problems later. It’s like the old adage, ‘prevention is better than sure’.

The teeth could be stuck, or impacted. That means they can’t break through your jaw and into your mouth. Maybe your mouth is too small to make room for them, or the teeth could be growing at an angle to other teeth. They can damage the tooth next door if they push up against it. Some dentists take out healthy molars to prevent problems later on. As you age, the bones in your mouth get harder. That makes your teeth tougher to remove. If you wait, you could have problems after surgery that range from heavy bleeding and fractured teeth to severe numbness and minor loss of movement in your jaw. These troubles could last a few days or a lifetime.

This is caused when there is no enough room for the wisdom teeth; hence they grow at odd angles. So, if you feel like wisdom teeth are coming in, then makes sure there is no potential issue by consulting a dentist. In this article, we have compiled the four major reasons why your wisdom teeth may have to be extracted by a dentist. They are Erupting at Odd Angles If your wisdom teeth grow up straight and do not interfere with the rest of your smile, then it’s growing in the right direction. But, in case, if the third molars are coming in at an angle pushing through the gums horizontally, then proper attention should be given to avoid any future complications. They are Partially Erupted The wisdom teeth are not fully erupted due to some blockages in the eruption area. In these cases, the wisdom teeth should be removed because it may attract bad bacteria and become infected, swollen and painful. Orthodontic Treatment For patients wearing braces, the erupted wisdom teeth will apply pressure to the other teeth toward the front of the mouth, causing crowding or pain. To avoid such painful circumstances, the wisdom teeth should be removed to ensure a successful orthodontic treatment. Gum Disease It’s recommended for patients with gum disease to extract wisdom teeth because the infection in the gum spreads and infects the impacted wisdom teeth that are struggling to come out of the gum line. This causes extreme pain and discomfort.

Recommendations are evolving on how to handle wisdom teeth. (Photo: PhotoDisc) Story Highlights Wisdom teeth are often misaligned Those third molars emerge at ages 17 to 25 There is now a more nuanced message about handling those teeth CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE For decades, having wisdom teeth removed was a rite of passage – one many high school graduates squeezed in before leaving for college. The thinking was that it was best to lose those mostly useless, ill-fitting teeth before they caused infections or other trouble.  Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, often are misaligned and impacted – fully or partly stuck below the gum line – because they emerge late, at ages 17 to 25, after the jaw has stopped growing and other teeth have filled the mouth. "Historically, oral surgeons have had the view that it's better to take them out, better to be safe than sorry," says Richard Niederman, director of the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry at the Forsyth Institute, Cambridge, Mass. But parents, teens and young adults can expect a more nuanced message these days.  In a nutshell: some healthy wisdom teeth may be OK to keep, as long as you undergo regular exams and X-rays to catch signs of trouble, according to the latest recommendations from the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. That group represents the 9,000 surgeons who remove most wisdom teeth in the United States. Some critics of routine wisdom tooth extraction go further: They say it's best to keep most of the teeth and avoid the risks of anesthesia and surgery. "There might be some justification for removing 30%," says Jay Friedman, a California dentist who has been a consultant to insurers and a witness in dental malpractice cases. In a report published in 2007 in the American Journal of Public Health , Friedman called the removal of some 10 million wisdom teeth each year "a public health hazard."  He focused on the harm the surgeries could cause, from infections to nerve damage. At Friedman's urging, the American Public Health Association in 2008 adopted a policy opposing the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. But in a position paper in 2011, the oral surgeon's group said that policy was "based on an unscientific extrapolation of data." The group laid out evidence that most symptom-free wisdom teeth were not disease-free. "About two-thirds of the time, there's going to be some problem," most often gum disease or cavities, says Raymond P. White Jr., an oral surgery professor at the University of North Carolina. But the surgeon's group has revised advice on truly  trouble-free teeth.  A web page for consumers , updated in 2012, says that "wisdom teeth that are completely erupted and functional, painless, cavity-free, in a hygienic environment with healthy gum tissue, and are disease-free may not require extraction."  It says patients and doctors should discuss options, ranging from removal to regular monitoring. That can be a complicated discussion, says Thomas Dodson, an oral surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.  He says that while one in three wisdom teeth seen by oral surgeons is disease-free, all the teeth are healthy in just 10% of patients.  So patients may be deciding whether to keep some teeth but not others. Still, those healthy teeth pose a dilemma, he says, because there's no good evidence on whether it's better to remove or retain them. Immediate surgery has risks, he says. About one in 20 patients develops an infection, one in 100 has hard-to-control bleeding and another one in 100 loses some feeling in the lips or tongue, usually but not always temporarily, he says. But keeping the teeth may mean a more complicated surgery later. It also means spending time and money on regular exams and X-rays. The problem, Dodson says, is that no one can predict which teeth will stay healthy. Given that unpredictability, the best course is leaving healthy teeth alone, especially since some impacted teeth will eventually emerge, Friedman says.  He also says the oral surgery group has stretched the definition of diseased wisdom teeth by including any that are surrounded by open pockets of 4 millimeters or more. While so-called periodontal pockets can collect harmful bacteria, their presence alone does not prove gums are diseased, he says. Stuart Froum, a periodontist in New York City and president-elect of the American Academy of Periodontology, agrees. Froum says he looks for swelling, bleeding and other signs to diagnose gum disease around any tooth.  When those signs appear around wisdom teeth, he says, patients may want to consult both surgeons and periodontists about whether the best course is extraction or other treatments, such as medications and trimming of tissue around the teeth. Dodson says he talks to patients about all options but recommends extraction when signs of gum disease are present.  He says most agree. Even when wisdom teeth are healthy, just 40% choose to keep them, he says. But patients already in a surgeon's office may not be typical. Since most referrals to oral surgeons come from general dentists, one just-completed study is looking at how often and why dentists recommend young people keep or get rid of wisdom teeth. Results have not yet been published, but the study will look at whether patients follow the advice and how they fare after two years, says researcher Greg Huang, chair of orthodontics at the University of Washington School of Dentistry. The American Dental Association referred questions about wisdom teeth to the oral surgery group. The association's website says "every patient is unique," but wisdom teeth may need to be removed for a number of reasons. The association also says wisdom teeth that are retained should be monitored for changes.

Posted under: Affordable Dental Care , Dental Tips , General | Posted on: March 18, 2014  Tweet    That third and final set of molars that emerge later in life in the deepest recesses of your mouth—named “wisdom teeth” as if they are a rite of passage into adulthood—can be a blemish in what might be an otherwise perfect dental record. Yes, these teeth disturb the oral health of a majority of individuals, requiring wisdom teeth removal. It is believed that “once upon a time” the wisdom teeth were essential to the caveman. Today, modern man seems to have little need for the teeth, much less space for them in the mouth. These teeth often emerge misaligned, crowding the other teeth, or hide partially below the surface of the gum line, stirring up damage to the jawbone or nerves, and causing wisdom teeth pain. Wisdom teeth removal has become a common procedure—nearly 85 percent of adults have had their wisdom teeth removed to protect their oral health. Wisdom teeth pain is not something to ignore. This can be a sign of crowding or impacted wisdom teeth. In either case, your oral health may be at stake and you should seek the advice of your dental care professional. Fully impacted wisdom teeth are enclosed within the soft tissue of the jawbone, while partially impacted wisdom teeth break partway through the gum line. A partial eruption often leaves an opening for bacterial growth around the tooth, leading to infection, tooth decay, or gum disease. These conditions are also associated with pain, swelling, jaw stiffness, and general illness. Your dentist will likely recommend prompt wisdom teeth removal to inhibit further development of adverse conditions or disease. If you are unsure about the state of your wisdom teeth—fully impacted teeth can’t be seen with the naked eye—ask your dentist. Periodic X-rays during routine dental care visits will allow you and your dentist to monitor your teeth. If the position of your teeth is already cause for concern, your dentist may recommend wisdom teeth removal or refer you to an oral surgeon for further evaluation. Many times, dentists and oral surgeons will recommend removal to avoid future problems. Although your wisdom teeth may not be causing you trouble now, wisdom teeth removal becomes a risky procedure late in life. Younger people tend to have wisdom teeth roots that have not fully developed and the bone is less dense, making removal easier. Older people, however, often have a longer healing time and more intense recovery. Wisdom Teeth Removal Removal of wisdom teeth is often an outpatient procedure, performed at the dentist’s or oral surgeon’s office. The ease of the procedure varies case by case, largely depending on the position of the teeth at time of removal. Your dental care provider can make you aware of what to expect when you have your exam before the procedure. Your dental care professional will use a local anesthetic to numb any pain that might occur during the surgery. If necessary, your dentist may sedate you as well. The teeth will then be carefully extracted, minimizing disturbance to the bone and optimizing your long-term oral health.

Should they be removed? When and why?            Should they be removed? When and why?   Wisdom teeth or third molars are the teeth furthest away in the dental arches and they are usually the last ones to erupt… if they ever come out!  For their eruption to occur normally, there must be sufficient growth at the back of the jaws to accommodate these teeth. For most people who have all their permanent teeth, this happens rarely and wisdom teeth fail to erupt.  Growth of the lower jaw occurs mostly at the back and this growth is essential to allow the eruption of the third molars (circle). If growth is inadequate, wisdom teeth will remain impacted.  It is very rare to see someone with the maximum possible of 32 teeth in the mouth (including wisdom teeth) that are optimally aligned and functional.  Teeth that have not completed their eruption within a reasonable time are called “ impacted ” if they are completely submerged under the gum and “ semi-impacted ” if they pierce through the gum only partially.  The dental community agrees to recommend the extraction of third molars that are symptomatic or cause problems (pain, infection, damage to other teeth, etc.).       We can have up to 32 teeth in the mouth including wisdom teeth (*), but it is very rare to see a dentition with all the teeth positioned in an esthetic and functional way, as in this case. (This dentition was treated orthodontically.)   But what about impacted teeth that are asymptomatic ? Wisdom teeth have historically been blamed for many problems. They are accused, among other things, to cause tooth movement by exerting pressure on other teeth when trying to erupt. This would be responsible for the movement of other teeth and the increase in dental crowding and rotation of the anterior teeth with time. Is this “ popular belief ” justified?   Studies have shown that, although they may play a small role in these tooth movements in late adolescence and later, they are not the main cause and several other more important factors, such as residual growth must be considered.  Even when third molars are extracted, it is common to see anterior dental movements occur thereafter.  Therefore, several associations of dental professionals (orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons) have concluded that it is inappropriate to extract third molars only to prevent unwanted dental movements.  Removing third molars will not prevent lower anterior dental crowding. But this doesn’t mean that there are not other reasons to extract third molars. There are many…  However, a semi-impacted tooth or a tooth presenting signs of pathologies represents a risk of serious problems. Such a tooth can be compared to a “time bomb” in the patient’s mouth; you don’t really know when it will “explode”!       Examples of impacted third molars that can only be seen with the help of radiographs.   There are, however, several other reasons to extract third molars.   For example, if they have symptoms , such as pain, infection, have caries, are difficult to clean, have a severe malposition, etc., it is best to remove them.  It is almost always indicated to extract a tooth that is “ semi-impacted ” because it presents a higher risk of infection and decay in the mid or long term.  In summary, it is frequently indicated to extract wisdom teeth that do not come out, but the reason is mainly to solve a problem already affecting these teeth or to prevent the development of pathologies (cysts, tumors, resorption (wear) of adjacent teeth).  Extraction is not intended to prevent the movements of other teeth over time.     Although both lower third molars of this 24-year-old woman are partially erupted, they are partially covered with gum tissue (semi-impacted) and difficult to clean. They have become decayed within only a few months of their eruption (arrows and dark areas on X-rays show decay). It is preferable to extract these third molars before the problem worsens.   However, if you prefer to keep asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth , do not ignore them.   It is strongly recommended to have regular radiographic assessments made (every 3-4 years) to detect the onset of potential problems as described above.  Symptoms affecting third molars can occur long after the appearance of a problem and, at that time, significant damage is often already present and irreversible.  Several authors suggest that uninfected and symptom free wisdom teeth may remain indefinitely in the mouth in adults. (Zachrisson 2005)   Note that it is rarely necessary to extract third molars as part of an orthodontic treatment. However this may be necessary if, for example, those teeth would interfere with the normal eruption of another molar (second molar) or prevent the movement of teeth towards the back of the mouth. Another exception would be when a jaw surgery, such as a mandibular advancement, is planned ( orthognathic surgery ). In such a case, the oral surgeon will prefer to extract the lower wisdom teeth at least six months prior to the surgery in order to avoid a “bad split” of the mandible during the surgical intervention.  We like to use the “jack-in-the-box” analogy to try to describe certain unpredictable dentition problems and behaviors. Wisdom teeth are well suited for this comparison; it is hard to predict if they will come out and if so, how and when. They are full of surprises!    Examples of third molar eruption problems        Impacted upper and lower third molars leaning against the second molars in a 21-year-old male. There are even 2 upper wisdom teeth on the right radiograph! These molars will not erupt and can damage other teeth.       Impacted wisdom teeth (upper and lower third molars) located under the second molars that started to resorb the roots of the second molars to such an extent that both third AND second molars had to be extracted. (courtesy of Dr G. Noreau)             Upper third molar eruption problems. Only a radiograph can detect this anomaly (25-year-old woman). These teeth will not erupt adequately and their extreme malposition justifies their extraction. The tooth on the picture on the right can damage the second molar if it stays in the mouth.       A routine radiograph in this 13-year-old patient reveals impacted lower wisdom teeth that are almost not formed but overlap the roots of the second molars, which could damage them in the long term. It would be indicated to extract them before the formation of their roots is too advanced. Note that such situation can be asymptomatic for the patient.        Predicting the eruption of wisdom teeth   The main way to assess the presence and position of third molars is to take a panoramic radiograph and evaluate certain factors, such as the size of the teeth, the formation of their roots, the direction of eruption, the available space, the jaw bone, etc.  In an attempt to predict the eruption of third molars, several methods have been developed. Some are very ingenious and original, but none has proven to be accurate every time. Some are very simple while others rely on fancy calculations of tooth position and evaluation of future growth.  But… despite the availability of several analytical methods, predicting which teeth will erupt adequately or not is sometimes just a lucky guess!     Look at the following examples of radiographs that show the behavior of wisdom teeth over many years.  Who could have predicted what happened?  Note: The letters represent the patient’s initials and the numbers are the patient’s age at the time the radiographs were taken.        (A) A wisdom tooth was visible on a radiograph, far behind the second premolar as early as 11 years of age. (B) 3 years later, this tooth seems farther away. (C) After a few years, the impacted molar migrated forward and seems to be on the right path to erupt. Who could have guessed? To be continued…      Change in the position of wisdom teeth from age 15 to 21    Evolution of the position of lower wisdom teeth during a 6-year period. As soon as the teeth will obviously not come out properly, it would be preferable to extract them to avoid a more complex intervention (extraction) later on (for the patient and the surgeon).    (A) At 15 years of age, the lower wisdom teeth are already tilted forward.  (B) 3 years later, the teeth tip more forward. There is not enough growth at the back of the mandible to allow the impacted molars to upright and erupt. It would be indicated to extract these molars at this time because it is impossible for these teeth to come out properly. The upper wisdom teeth continue growing, but the left one stays blocked behind the second molar.  (C) At 21 years of age, the lower wisdom teeth are positioned horizontally, which will make their extraction more complicated.  (D) Upper right third molar once extracted.  (E) Upper left third molar.  (F and G) The lower third molars had to be cut in several pieces to be extracted. The maxillofacial surgeons’ skills still allow the extraction of teeth in a very bad position, but these extractions are a lot more complex for both the patient and the surgeon. It is thus preferable to extract impacted wisdom teeth as soon as they are considered to have no chance whatsoever to erupt and before the impaction worsens and makes the intervention more difficult.     Other considerations in the decision to remove or retain third molars  Absence of opposing teeth    It is indicated to extract wisdom teeth that have no opposing tooth (*) in the lower arch, even if they erupt.           When a tooth is partially out, the gingiva covering it is an area where plaque and food debris can accumulate and cause infection, inflammation and tooth decay. It is then indicated to either uncover such a tooth by removing the excess gum tissue or to extract it if the tooth cannot be properly uncovered to help it complete its eruption.       A semi-impacted third molar is more difficult to clean which makes it more susceptible to dental caries. This tooth shows an incipient carious lesion in the surface groove.       Misleading images!     Sometimes, the clinical examination gives the impression that the eruption of wisdom teeth occurs well or normally, but the radiological examination reveals a whole different reality.      (A) The lower right wisdom tooth of this 24-year-old woman came through the gum tissue several months before, but its eruption does not seem to progress anymore.     (B) Although this tooth appears to erupt normally, a radiograph reveals the severe horizontal malposition of this tooth.  The visible part in the mouth (circled) is in fact the back of the tooth that is tipped forward. This semi-impacted tooth will certainly be problematic one day (infection, cavities, etc.), so it is indicated to extract it.  As described previously, the reason to recommend the extraction is not the risk of seeing this tooth displace the other teeth in front of it, but rather the fact that it could get infected and cause problems in this area of the mouth.   Presence of damaged teeth  When a wisdom tooth has little chance of coming out and another tooth in front of it is severely damaged to the point where major restorations will be necessary later on, it could be logical to extract the damaged tooth and “recuperate” the wisdom tooth. In such a situation, it is beneficial to postpone the decision to extract a third molar if an orthodontic treatment is envisioned. Extracting the wisdom tooth would force the patient to restore the damaged tooth or replace it if it were to be extracted eventually.    Not having extracted an impacted wisdom tooth very early made it possible to recuperate it and eliminate a severely damaged molar.   (A and C) 15-year-old teenager with a lower left molar (black * asterisk) that is severely compromised by a root canal treatment. Extracting this molar made it possible to recuperate the impacted and tipped wisdom tooth (red *) and close the space remaining following the extraction by moving the other molars forward (arrow).  (B and D) After the corrections, the space created by the extraction is completely closed , the wisdom tooth (third molar) came out, uprighted and is now functional. The green asterisk (*) indicates where the wisdom tooth was. This patient thus avoided the necessity to have a crown which, since he was very young, would have required to be replaced several times throughout his life.   Do all third molars need to be extracted?     Sometimes, a single wisdom tooth seems problematic and must be extracted. What about the other third molars that stay in the mouth? Should they necessarily be extracted as well? To learn more about it, consult our Ortho-blog column “ Do all third molars need to be extracted? ” describing certain points to take into consideration to decide which wisdom teeth need to be extracted .        The behavior of wisdom teeth is hard to predict. It answers a very complex “equation” with several variables. Each of them can influence individually or together the symptoms and evolution of the eruption of teeth.    Lack of symptoms doesn’t mean lack of disease   Many studies have concluded that symptom free wisdom teeth do not always mean disease free teeth as there are many types of infections which can be developing over time around these teeth. Very often he decision to extract or not  it is a judgment call on the part of the practitioner but when you look at the pros and cons long term, it is probably safer to extract borderline problematic wisdom tooth instead of hanging on to them in the hope that nothing happens.  For further information, see this short scientific article: Evaluation and management of asymptomatic third molars : lack of symptoms does not equate to lack of pathology. 1    The influence of wisdom teeth on stability of teeth   Dental crowding is a normal and unavoidable phenomenon throughout the years. The age at which it will occur, the severity of crowing and where it will occur may vary from one person to another and this will happen whether an orthodontic treatment was performed or not. The teeth that are most often affected are the lower anterior teeth (incisors and canines), but all the other teeth may move as well.  Wisdom teeth have often been blamed in order to try to find a cause to undesirable tooth movements or displacements that occur after the end of an orthodontic treatment. Numerous researches and studies were published on this subject, but the conclusion from the most serious sources is that the third molars that erupt at the back of the dental arches do not significantly cause these displacements.  Such displacements may occur and will likely occur whether an orthodontic treatment was performed or not. The question should then not be “ IF ” teeth will move but rather “ WHEN ” they will move. 🙁  To learn more on orthodontic retention and the influence of wisdom teeth on the stability of teeth .

I wasn't in pain. They were somewhat impacted, or growing in at a bit of an angle. My parents decided to go ahead with the surgery to remove them anyway. "There was a lot of blood," the doctors told me first thing after waking up — i.e.,  hemorrhaging. That, and the lingering effects of anesthesia, explained why, for the next several hours, I had to be rolled around in a wheelchair. The following weeks involved a mostly liquid diet and lots of pudding. I hate pudding. The inside of my mouth, as one friend aptly put it, resembled a "lunar landscape." And it hurt. My then-frail teenage body was not prepared to handle intensive surgery. Even as my mouth slowly began to heal, my body did not respond to the ordeal well, and I caught pneumonia. This entailed temperatures of 103 degrees and fever dreams of fighting the Nazis on Normandy beaches. I have never been sicker in my life. And after researching this topic further, I am now convinced that the wisdom teeth industry is probably a scam. Advertisement As of 2011, 10 million wisdom teeth get hacked out of the back of Americans' mouths a year. For decades, the procedure was performed only when the teeth, also known as third molars, were causing real trouble, like in the case of appendectomies. After World War II, however, the ranks of dentists exploded, and with them recommendations that people get their third molars removed as a precaution. As dental care got more advanced—and the financial incentive to perform the procedures increased—wisdom teeth removal began to become as routine as getting braces. Advertisement Today, many still undergo this procedure for legitimate reasons: ingrown or impacted wisdom teeth can lead to infections, tooth decay, and generally unpleasant levels of pain . But a large percentage of patients choose to undergo this act of sawing, bleeding, and stitching merely as a precaution, often putting up more than $1,000 for the experience. This is not entirely surprising: America excels at  ordering up unnecessary medical procedures. It's an epidemic: By one count, Americans waste $750 billion a year on unproductive care , more than our nation’s entire budget for K–12 education. For 30 years, Dr. Jay Friedman has been on a one-man crusade to halt the tide of wisdom teeth removal, which he says is one of the most egregious examples of unnecessary medical procedures. In 2007, Friedman published a study in which he estimated that at least two-thirds of the millions of wisdom teeth extracted each year could or should have stayed in, but were instead removed out of unfounded fears of what would happen otherwise. Advertisement In Friedman's estimation, you risk more enduring complications from wisdom teeth removal surgery than just leaving the suckers in your mouth. Consider this list of potential complications from wisdom teeth removal surgery: Friedman "It is specious to contend that less than 3 days of temporary discomfort or disability is a small price to pay to avoid the future risks of root [destruction], serious infections, and cysts," he wrote in his paper. "Also ignored is the risk of incidental injury such as broken jaws, fractured teeth, damage to the [mouth] joints, temporary and, especially, permanent paresthesia or dysesthesia (numbness and dysfunction of the lower lip and the tongue)." Advertisement Friedman is not a lone voice crying in the dental wilderness. A 2002 paper published in the Journal of the Canadian Dental Association estimated that the complication rate from wisdom teeth surgery was between 7% and 10%. A 2011 study of more than 6,000 patients in Greece found that only 2.7% of in-tact wisdom teeth result in problems . And an older study often cited by critics of routine extraction found that only 12% of surveyed middle-aged patients experienced a complication from keeping impacted wisdom teeth. And then there's the specter—rare, but possible—of death. Sydney Galleger, a teen in Minnesota, had just finished her junior year of high school last summer when she went under. Everything seemed to be going well until the very end, when Sydney's blood pressure shot up, her pulse dropped, and she went into cardiac arrest . Press  coverage  of Galleger's death pointed the finger squarely at her wisdom teeth removal procedure. An autopsy did not do much to dispel this as the main cause. Advertisement In the face of all of this, the other side of the debate maintains that, in fact, there is no debate. At the center is the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), the doctors who specialize in wisdom teeth removal. In a just released white paper , the association gave this policy statement on the procedure: …while not all third molars require surgical management, given the documented high incidence of problems associated with third molars over time, all patients should be evaluated by someone experienced and expert in third molar management. As evidence of this "high incidence of problems," they point to a review that looked at seven papers examining what happened when young adults left their wisdom teeth in. The review concluded that the risk of having to undergo removal appeared to increase as subjects aged. Advertisement But at least one of the studies in the AAOMS' review concluded no such thing. Rather, the British study found that 83.13% of patients survived the one-year study period symptom-free, and just 5% had to have teeth removed. Indeed, Britain's National Health Service now advises the following on wisdom teeth removal : Your wisdom teeth don't usually need to be removed if they're impacted but aren't causing any problems. This is because there's no proven benefit of doing this and it carries the risk of complications. Advertisement Even if they're impacted! Another study published in 2006 by the Cardiff University in Wales found a slightly higher incidence of teeth eventually having to be removed, but also concluded that there was "little support for the reintroduction of prophylactic removal of wisdom teeth," referring to the already declining practice in the region. Dr. Julia Boughner, a cell biologist at the University of Saskatchewan, has been following the debate closely for about five years since she opened a research lab to look into how human jaws evolved. In 2013, she published an article on the state of the debate, writing: …Evidence directly linking third molars to oral diseases is lacking. Further, it is not clear if the age-associated risk of disease 23 (i.e., the older the patient, the greater the apparent risk posed by impacted third molars) is simply due to the increased likelihood of bacterial accumulation and tissue inflammation with time. Advertisement At a minimum, she told me, there remains a distinct absence of comprehensive, unbiased studies on the wisdom teeth question. "The trick is that clinicians still don't have all the tools and data available that would make them comfortable with a sit-and-wait approach," she said. In a 2011 New York Times story on this debate, health writer Roni Caryn Rabin said that the price of leaving your teeth in was that you'll have to be extra fastidious about your own dental care, with frequent cleanings and X-rays if necessary.

February 08, 1989 | By Jane E. Brody, New York Times News Service. Chances are that as soon as wisdom teeth begin struggling to emerge, a dentist will recommend that they come out. But should they? The wisdom of removing wisdom teeth before they cause trouble has long been debated. In only a small percentage of people do they grow in straight and healthy. The human jaw has been steadily decreasing in size for millennia and few people now have jaws large enough to accommodate four more teeth in the back of their mouths. As a result, many wisdom teeth grow in sideways, emerge only partway from the gum or remain impacted, forever trapped beneath it. According to recent estimates, 80 to 90 percent of Americans have at least one impacted ``third molar,`` as dentists call a wisdom tooth. If this were the end of the story, there would be no debate; unerupted wisdom teeth could just sit there in the gums. Unfortunately, in many patients (exactly how many no one really knows), malpositioned or impacted wisdom teeth eventually cause trouble. They may become infected or decayed, or they may damage adjacent teeth. Cysts and even cancers can form. Wait and see? The debate, then, is whether to remove improperly positioned wisdom teeth before such problems arise or wait until they do. While some specialists say, ``Don`t bother them until they bother you,`` most believe it is better to get malpositioned wisdom teeth out when you are young and healthy, since they are likely to cause trouble eventually. Both sides have good reasons for their views. The ``don`t bother them`` school cites the cost and discomfort of pulling teeth, some of which will never cause trouble. Those who advocate removal note that as patients age, the surgery becomes more difficult, the complications more numerous and the recovery more prolonged. In an effort to resolve the controversy, the National Institutes of Health held a conference in 1979. It was agreed that straight, healthy wisdom teeth should be left alone and that those that are diseased or causing trouble for other teeth should be removed. Differing opinions But the main issue, whether impacted but otherwise healthy wisdom teeth should be pulled to prevent trouble, was never resolved. ``The panel waffled on this issue,`` said Dr. Walter C. Guralnick, a cochairman of the meeting. After long discussion, the panel reluctantly agreed that ``impaction or malposition of a third molar is an abnormal state and may justify its removal.`` Guralnick, professor emeritus of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, explained recently that ``there has never been a good prospective study done to determine what percentage of people get into trouble if impacted wisdom teeth are left in place.`` No such study had begun before the 1979 conference and, despite the panel`s recommendation, none has been started since. Such a study would follow large numbers of people for many years to see what happens to their impacted wisdom teeth. Experts now have only one small study from which to judge; in it, most of the 60- to 70-year-olds who still had their wisdom teeth had no evident disease in their impacted teeth. Just as expected Not unexpectedly, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons recommends early removal of impacted wisdom teeth. Guralnick, who departs from this advice unless the teeth have partially emerged, nonetheless believes that the surgeons arrived at it honestly, using years of clinical experience as their basis. ``The economics of clinical practice is not the primary reason for the surgeons` view,`` he insisted. ``Oral surgeons today have enough other ways to earn a good living. They don`t depend on pulling wisdom teeth.`` Still, more than half of all Americans seem to wait until problems arise that force the issue, the oral surgeons report. The potential complications associated with malpositioned wisdom teeth are not in question. The only argument is about how likely the complications are to occur, especially if the teeth have not erupted through the gum. ``If wisdom teeth are partially emerged, symptoms eventually occur in more than 80 or 90 percent of cases,`` said Dr. Edwin D. Joy Jr., professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta. Common problems These are the most common complications of leaving malpositioned or impacted wisdom teeth in place: - Infection of the surrounding gum tissue. This condition, pericoronitis, is most likely to occur if the tooth is partially erupted or very close to the surface. - Fluid-filled cysts. These can form from remnants of tissue around the crown of the tooth, becoming large and painful. - Decay, or dental caries. The positioning of wisdom teeth makes them hard to clean and hard to repair. Decay is most likely if the teeth have erupted. 1 | 2 | Next    MORE: `They hated it': When `Trading Spaces' goes wrong Coffee Commercial Romance Grinds To A Halt Coping on land after surviving at sea   Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash: Her Daughter`s Account Cause of facial tingling can be very unnerving When one partner in a marriage doesn't want sex, what are options?

It could also come down to differences in how various cultures use their jaws. For example, in the 1970s, researchers tied the larger jaw that was present in Eskimo women to their tradition of chewing leather to soften it. In parts of East Asia, it's more common to find people with fewer wisdom teeth, if any [source: Vines ]. If people of a culture have reached the point where they don't use a trait, they may lose it.

Should They Stay or Should They Go?  Wisdom tooth extraction is expensive, and recovering from the surgery is no easy feat, considering that pain, bleeding, swelling, infection and nerve injury are but a few of the complications. Still, removing wisdom teeth is recommended by many dentists to avoid the pain and periodontal disease that results from an impacted tooth. The surgery should be done during young adulthood, before the teeth attach to the jaw and become too difficult to extract.  ­  In 2007, however, dentist Jay W. Friedman claimed in the American Journal of Public Health that at least two-thirds of wisdom tooth extractions are unnecessary [source: Friedman]. He and some other dentists argue that these teeth will come in at the proper position and cause no trouble. These dentists say that instead of simply doing preventative removals for most young people, we should only remove wisdom teeth that are impacted. Other dentists say that these teeth are still difficult to clean and should be removed.              1  2  3  4  NEXT       Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint      Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint                     More to Explore          Related Content          " "       Why are some animals harder to clone than others?

She wasn’t having any problems now, but our dentist said trouble could flare up unexpectedly in the middle of the semester, perhaps in the middle of exams, and then she would probably have to leave school to get the teeth pulled. Better to do it now, he said. Each year, despite the risks of any surgical procedure, millions of healthy, asymptomatic wisdom teeth are extracted from young patients in the United States, often as they prepare to leave for college. Many dental plans cover the removal of these teeth, which have partly grown in or are impacted below the gum. But scientific evidence supporting the routine prophylactic extraction of wisdom teeth is surprisingly scant, and in some countries the practice has been abandoned. “Everybody is at risk for appendicitis , but do you take out everyone’s appendix?” said Dr. Greg J. Huang, chairman of orthodontics at the University of Washington in Seattle. “I’m not against removing wisdom teeth, but you should do an assessment and have a good clinical reason.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Oral surgeons have long argued that if you don’t have your wisdom teeth removed at a young age, you are simply postponing the inevitable.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “It’s hard to get a percentage, but probably 75 to 80 percent of people do not meet the criteria of being able to successfully maintain their wisdom teeth,” said Dr. Louis K. Rafetto of Wilmington, Del., who headed the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons ’ task force on wisdom teeth. Another expert, Dr. Raymond P. White Jr., a professor of surgery at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry , said that roughly 60 to 70 percent of patients with wisdom teeth will eventually have trouble with them, but he acknowledged that data is limited. “We’re making decisions based on the best data we have,” he said. Those persuasive numbers are used repeatedly by dentists and oral surgeons to justify routine removal of wisdom teeth. Just last year, the surgeons’ association issued a statement subtitled “Keeping Wisdom Teeth May Be More Harmful Than Previously Thought,” saying it was imperative that patients understood “how harmful retaining these wisdom teeth can be.” The association said that 80 percent of young adults who retained previously healthy wisdom teeth developed problems within seven years, and that retained wisdom teeth are extracted up to 70 percent of the time. Yet when asked, the association was not able to produce the evidence for these figures. “We were not able to locate the reference for it, and subsequently deleted the statement from our Web site,” Janice Teplitz, the group’s associate executive director of communications, said last week. As of Monday, however, the association’s Web site still said that “ between 25 percent and almost 70 percent ” of the time, retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth “are eventually extracted.” Many studies suggest that the actual number of people who have trouble with their wisdom teeth is far lower.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Oral surgeons warn that even when young people are not experiencing pain or discomfort, they may have infection or inflammation; numerous studies have found that adults who keep their wisdom teeth tend to have more such problems over time than those who have them removed . But there does not appear to be a single randomized clinical trial — the gold standard for scientific proof — comparing similar patients who have and have not undergone prophylactic wisdom teeth removal.  Photo         Credit Stuart Goldenberg    Our dentist warned us that cysts and tumors could grow around impacted wisdom teeth. But a new study of more than 6,000 patients in Greece found that only 2.7 percent of the teeth had a cyst or tumor . An older study, often cited by critics of routine extraction, found that only 12 percent of 1,756 middle-aged people who had not had impacted wisdom teeth removed experienced a complication . Numerous comprehensive reviews of research, conducted by independent bodies not affiliated with oral surgeons, have concluded that there was no evidence to support routine prophylactic extraction of impacted but healthy wisdom teeth. Britain’s National Health Service stopped paying for the procedure if there was no good reason for it after an analysis by its Center for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York concluded in 1998 that there was no solid scientific evidence to support it . Also that year, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh said that for patients who do not have a condition related to third molars or whose teeth would probably grow in successfully, removal is “not advisable.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The group also said there is “reliable evidence” that suggests that removing wisdom teeth does not prevent or reduce crowding of front teeth. In 2008, the American Public Health Association dismissed arguments typically made for removing wisdom teeth : that adjacent teeth might be damaged, or that the teeth may harbor bacteria that cause periodontal disease. The association approved a policy saying these concerns do not justify the risks of surgery, which include possible nerve damage, complications from anesthesia . loss of the sense of taste and, very rarely, death. “The few studies of long-term retention of impacted teeth have shown little risk of harm,” the association concluded. So given what all agree is a lack of good evidence, how should consumers proceed when a dentist suggests removing healthy wisdom teeth? IF EXTRACTION IS RECOMMENDED All surgery carries risks, and you should try to ensure that there is something to be gained from having your wisdom teeth removed. Ask what the reason is in your case. Is there a chance the wisdom teeth will grow in successfully? If you see a dentist on a regular basis, is watchful waiting an option?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If you have an infection or inflammation, ask about less-invasive treatment. The general consensus among critics of routine extraction is that recurrent gum infection, or pericoronitis; irreparable tooth decay ; an abscess ; cysts; tumors; damage to nearby teeth and bone; or other pathological conditions justify the procedure. IF YOU CHOOSE SURGERY Most dental plans cover at least some of the costs of extraction. If you don’t have dental insurance, pulling all four teeth may cost several thousand dollars. Ask if you can have local anesthesia, which is considered safer than general anesthesia. Follow postoperative instructions carefully. Avoid being very active or eating solid food for three to four days (instead try noodles and milkshakes). Keeping ice on the jaw may help with pain and swelling . Painkillers may be needed. Young patients tend to recover sooner than older patients. IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST EXTRACTION Good dental hygiene will be even more important for you. The teeth in the back of the mouth are often harder to reach and clean well. Get frequent cleanings, and X-rays if necessary. Smoking increases the risk of periodontal disease, as does diabetes . If you have cavities in your back molars, you may be at greater risk for problems with the wisdom teeth. As for my daughter Emma, we have opted for watchful waiting. She went off to college last month, wisdom teeth and all.

Credit: Carlos Caetano | Shutterstock     BOSTON — Many people have suffered from impacted third molars, also known as wisdom teeth. But there are also a lucky few who are missing a wisdom tooth or two (or even all four). Why do some people have wisdom teeth, while others don't?  The answer, partly hinted at in new research presented here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , could also explain why particular ethnic groups, such as the Inuit, have a particularly low occurrence of wisdom teeth.  Some thousands of years ago, a random mutation arose which suppressed the formation of wisdom teeth, a trait that then spread and now accounts for the lack of wisdom teeth among some modern humans, said Princeton University researcher Alan Mann.  The oldest fossils missing third molars hail from China and are about 300,000 to 400,000 years old, suggesting the first mutation may have arisen there, Mann told LiveScience.  Like most mammals, humans' ancestors had four sets of three molars (for a total of 12, with six in both the upper and lower jaw) used to help chew and grind food. Unlike other mammals, however, humans underwent a period of evolution in which the brain greatly expanded in size , Mann said. This created an architectural problem; with a much larger brain case, the jaw had to become narrower so that it could still connect to the lower part of the skull, Mann said.  Genes that control the quantity of teeth, however, evolve independently from those that control brain development, Mann's research has shown. This led to a mismatch, in which the human jaw was no longer large enough, in many cases, to give wisdom teeth room to erupt through the gums.  Impacted third molars (teeth that do not make it out of the gums) can become infected, leading to serious health problems. Even more commonly, however, wisdom teeth cause severe pain . This fact alone could help explain how the lack of wisdom teeth evolved, Mann said: The pain could make one less likely to reproduce. That would favor people with the mutation, who would suffer less pain, he added. [ Top 10 Useless Limbs (and Other Vestigial Organs) ]  "Imagine a scenario where one evening a person is in serious pain from an impacted third molar," Mann said. "Their partner comes up and says, 'How about a bout of reproduction?' And the person says, 'Not tonight, dear, my jaws are killing me.'"  Perhaps 10 to 25 percent of Americans of European ancestry are missing at least one third molar, Mann said. For African Americans and Asian Americans, the figure is 11 percent and 40 percent, respectively, he said. But the Inuit, a group of people who live in the Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland and Alaska, have the fewest wisdom teeth ; about 45 percent of them lack one or more third molar, he said.  There are probably a couple reasons for this. For one, this group originated in Asia, where the oldest fossils lacking wisdom teeth were found, Mann said. Secondly, like other Asians, the Inuit tend to have flatter faces (when compared to Europeans and Africans), meaning they have even narrower jaws, leaving less room for teeth, he said. Third, Inuit teeth also tend to be larger than average, meaning that this mutation would be even more advantageous in this population, Mann said.   Reach Douglas Main at dmain@techmedianetwork.com .

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Wisdom Teeth  Teeth  Dental Hygiene  Dentistry What is the percentage of people that get their wisdom teeth removed? Dent de sagesse Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers   Greg Ceyhan , Dentist with Aesthetic Dentistry of Arrowhead Answered Apr 24, 2014 Many people that come through a dentists office have their wisdom teeth removed. It's been speculated that wisdom teeth, or the third molars, have become obsolete and that the human mouth has become too small to support all 32 teeth, with the high numbers of impactions and crowding caused by the wisdom teeth in dental patients. Even those whose wisdom teeth grow in without any issues find that these teeth have a high chance of disease and cavities that cause the teeth to need to be removed at some point in the future. Many dentists have actually begun removing wisdom teeth as a routine procedure due to the high rate of retained wisdom teeth needed to be extracted within the next 7 seven years. Actual numbers on how many people get their wisdom teeth removed have been hard to come by, with even the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons not coming up with any concrete numbers, but estimates range between 60 and 85% of people having one or more wisdom teeth removed, and up to 80% of those who initially retain their wisdom teeth needing to have them removed at a later time. 10.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Dent de sagesse Percentage is very high, shall we say around 80%. However, bear in mind that quite a number of wisdom teeth were and are removed not because they are impacted, semi-impacted, or pushing at the second molars but because they need to be removed because of extensive caries or parodontopathy. In fact, main fact in prosthetics is that all dental surgeons should keep the most posterior teeth because they’re essential for prosthetic rehabilitation. Therefore, in my dental days I used to remove many teeth and the main reason for removal of wisdom teeth were: not erupted; or partially erupted; pushing on second molars causing pain and caries; infection under the mucosal flap (pericoronitis); but the main reason percentage-wise was large caries, parodontal abscess, apical granuloma or abscess, parodontopathy. 771 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions Why is it so bad to remove wisdom teeth at home?

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery  Wisdom Teeth  Dental Hygiene  Dentistry What are the chances of nerve damage from wisdom teeth removal? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 4 Answers   Dr Manmohan Bramta , MDS Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Sardar Patel Institute of Dental Sciences (2008) Answered Apr 18, 2017 In case of upper wisdom teeth there are almost nil chances for any nerve damage Mandibular/Lower wisdom teeth are usually in close proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve which runs in mandibular canal innervating mandibular teeth, gums, and chin. The chances of nerves damage to this nerve is determined by an Intra Oral Peri Apical X-ray or a panaromic view (OPG). These X-rays give us a approximate relation of the tooth with the canal/nerve, and based on this analysis we can tell. A qualified Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, will always keep in mind this proximity of nerve to tooth and remove the third molar accordingly, however mild injury to the nerve is not uncommon. In case of mild injury, patient only has mild discomfort in form of parasthesia/loss of sensation in lower lip, which heals in a few days to weeks. Another nerve that can be damaged during wisdom tooth removal is lingual nerve. But now the incidence of damage to this nerve is very low because of improvement and evolution of wisdom tooth removal techniques which prefer usage of a drill rather than chisel and mallet. To summarise, the incidence of nerve damage is relatively very low, such that it should not be a criteria for you not to go for its removal. 902 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

Complications from leaving infection-prone wisdom teeth can also kill you. If you know you have heart problems you must inform your oral surgeon. As for your fear, your oral surgeon should discuss the risks of taking them out vs. leaving them in so you understand which one to fear more. Let him/her know about your anxiety and they can help you with medication. The procedure itself will be a non-event as you will probably be in la-la land with IV sedation.

Wisdom teeth extraction sounds horrible but it really is nothing to be worried about. Of course there will be some discomfort after the extraction but people can manage fine with prescribed pain killers and good post operation care. Expect some swelling as it is normal, make sure you stay well rested after the extraction. Stay home and watch movies or read books to keep you occupied.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery  Wisdom Teeth  Dentists  Teeth  Dental Hygiene  Dentistry  Health  Medicine and Healthcare How painful is it to have your wisdom tooth extracted? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 14 Answers   John Jay , DDS  Dentistry & Bloggers, UCLA School of Dentistry (2005) Updated Jan 16, 2017 I actually haven’t had own wisdom teeth pulled but I have removed countless wisdom teeth throughout my career. To say that there is no pain whatsoever is not really true. However if you and your dentist pay attention and follow protocol then it can be quite an easy procedure. Here are factors you and your dentist must pay attention to if you’re planning on removing your wisdom teeth without being put to asleep ( click here for full article ) Distinguishing pain versus pressure No matter how numb your dentist makes your teeth, you will still feel pressure in the region. The reason is because there are different nerve receptors for pain as opposed to pressure. Conventional anesthesia, what you refer to as Novocaine, only numbs pain receptors and not pressure sensors. It’s very difficult to distinguish the difference between the two if you haven’t had a tooth pulled before so let me use a demonstration: Grab your front tooth and tug at it. This is what pressure feels like. Now poke at your gums with you nails of some other sharp object. This is what pain feels like. Distinguishing between pain and pressure is very important when it comes to wisdom removal surgery. You should expect lots of pressure but no actual pain if you’re numbed up properly. Should you feel actual pain then communicate with your dentist or oral surgeon right away to receive more numbing agent. However, if you get scared and keep insisting that you’re feeling pain when it’s actually pressure, then it’s not going to go well. There’s only so many shots you can safely receive, particularly when removing multiple wisdom teeth. Insisting on more and more shots could raise your blood pressure to dangerously high levels and compromise your health. The more pain you have coming in with, the more difficult it will be to numb your tooth There is a big difference between removing wisdom teeth, or for that matter any tooth, which is actively hurting versus doing it to prevent pain. If you’re experiencing a severe toothache it will be much harder to numb your tooth. Our nerves become more sensitive when we are experiencing pain which consequently makes it much harder to numb the tooth. The more pain you have and the longer you’ve been in pain, the more difficult it will be to numb the offending tooth. For instance if you need 2 to 3 shots to numb an average wisdom tooth it now requires 4, 5 or even more shots to numb a wisdom tooth that is very painful. My advice to you is that if your wisdom teeth need to be removed then do so before they become very painful. Otherwise expect plenty of shots and you still might not get fully numb. Difficulty of tooth removal The more covered with bone (impacted) your tooth is, the more challenging removing it will be. Teeth which are all the way out are the easiest ones to remove. Teeth which are partially trapped underneath your gums start to become more difficult to remove. Those which are partially or fully underneath your jawbone are by far the most difficult ones to extract. You may or may not feel pain during surgery depending on how well your dentist or oral surgeon has numbed you, however you will definitely feel lots of pressure when removing fully impacted wisdom teeth. I usually tell my patients in advance which teeth are expected to be the hardest to remove so they are well informed and prepared. I feel this is important not just for them to know which teeth can be more difficult to remove, but also which ones will take the longest to heal. The more complicated a removal, the more damage to your jawbone and thus more pain after surgery. Location of wisdom teeth As a general rule, lower wisdom teeth are more difficult to remove so they can be more painful as well. First off, there are a lot more nerves going to your lower wisdom teeth than to the upper ones due to human anatomy. Secondly, your jawbone is much denser in the lower jaw (mandible) than it is in the upper jaw (maxilla). As a result lower wisdom teeth are generally much more difficult to remove than upper ones. To put this in perspective, it typically takes me about 5 minutes to remove an upper impacted wisdom tooth as opposed to 20 to 30 minutes for a lower impacted wisdom. Speed of your metabolism Another factor which I’ve noticed affects your pain experience during the surgery is your body’s metabolism. Metabolism not only affects how quickly your numbness kicks in but also how rapidly it wears off. This is important especially when we are removing all four wisdoms at once. If you have high metabolism then chances are by the time we reach your last tooth the numbness has already worn off. If you start to feel your numbness wearing off during surgery, immediately inform your dentist or oral surgeon and ask him or her for more Novocaine. Keep in mind that being numb is not only important throughout your surgery, but it also matters for after the procedure is completed. If your numbness wears off before you’ve had a chance to get home and take your medications, then you will experience some serious pain. So don’t be shy asking for more shots if you actually need them as it only benefits you in the end. Miscellaneous factors There was an article about how redheads feel more pain at the dentist and I had actually noticed it to be true myself. Some people, particularly very light skinned individuals, tend to be more sensitive during dental treatment, the same way they would be to sunlight for instance. Another factors that affects your experience is your threshold against anesthesia. For example if you take lots of painkillers then you may not get numb as easily and require more shots. As you can see this is not a straight forward answer. However the bottomline is if you go to an experienced dentist or oral surgeon who pays attention to details, you should be able to get numb well and not feel any pain. If this is still not enough for you, then look into options of being put to asleep.

Ask New Question   Shalini Rajendran , I eat Bhelpuri without onions :-) Answered May 26, 2014 I had wisdom tooth extraction twice. You actually won't feel any pain during the procedure as the dental surgeon will give you enough anaesthetic and only start working on your tooth once your mouth feels numb. During the extraction you will feel a lot of pressure but not pain. Once your tooth is out , surgeon will stitch that area and send you home. The pain will start in a couple of hours once the anaesthetic wears off. Yes, it will trouble you for a couple of days and you have to be very careful with your mouth , following all the instructions given carefully. They will likely ask you to be back in 5 days to remove the stitches and by then things will go back to normalcy. Chill!! 9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Note that I am talking about the lower ones. My dentist told me that the upper ones are less painful and are easier to extract.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Wisdom Teeth  Teeth  Dentistry Should I get my wisdom teeth out if they are not bothering me? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 42 Answers Quora User Answered Jun 1, 2014 · Author has 1k answers and 8.9m answer views Yes. Here's why: I waited until I was 27 and my teeth started shifting to get my wisdom teeth removed.  The pain of them coming in was totally tolerable, but my teeth were getting crowded and I didn't want to have more problems down the line. I read the longer you wait to have them removed, the more likely you are to have complications.  For me, that couldn't have been more true. The cost was somewhat more expensive for being put under, but not prohibitively so - a few hundred dollars, I think.  Worth every penny not to be in agonizing pain.  I have a so-so pain tolerance and a super high tolerance to normal anesthetics.  I once needed eight shots of novocaine for one root canal with the last two being inserted directly into the nerve. I never ever ever want to do that again. In this case, I was getting all four taken out and two of the four were all the way through, one was just barely under the gum line (I could feel it with my tongue), and the last was heading directly for my back teeth, completely hidden in the gum. I didn't feel any pain during the extractions.  It was a twilight sleep rather than intubation, so I felt very safe. When I had laser surgery at 15, they also used twilight sleep, so I was comfortable with the process.  They did give me my first ever Xanax and told me to take it an hour before I arrived.  That was the easiest IV insertion of my life. At first I was a little concerned but I just watched them put it in and thought wow, that's a little painful but whatever, duuuuuuude. They finished getting everything set up and I was out less than 15 minutes later. I was fine for the ride home and was talking and happy since the anesthesia hadn't completely worn off yet, but I was really, really drugged. Here's a short clip of the ride home so you get an idea of what it's like: I went home and took a nap and woke up crying from the pain a few hours later: The doctor gave me vicodin, but taking the maximum allowable dosage for the pain only took me to a 3/4 pain level and I ended up throwing up all the meds I took the second day because I couldn't eat much. The pain just kept getting worse. I can't even begin to explain the pain of this to you. It's like your jaw is in a giant pressure chamber and on fire at the same time. Horrible - walking around in tears for hours. Anything, including air moving through your mouth sets off the intense reaction all over again. After researching online, I suspected I had dry sockets. I contacted his office and told them so, but he still couldn't write the scrip for the hydromorphone I knew would work (I've taken it many times before for various issues) until I came back for him to examine me. I had my boyfriend drive me an hour back to see him and once he looked inside my mouth and realized I wasn't just trying to get hopped up on drugs, he wrote the prescription. Turns out I had two dry sockets. Surprise, surprise. He then told me, "yeah, I had to break a tooth in two to get it out - I'm not surprised that the area was traumatized." I asked him why he gave me such a hard time about the pain meds then. He said he just has to be really careful because it's not a normal scrip for that and blah, blah, blah. YES BUT YOU KNEW I WOULD HAVE EXTRA PAIN. Oh, well. Not my first experience with a medical professional like that, unfortunately. After that, the pain was manageable, but water started coming out of my nose every time I did the wound irrigation. Did some research myself online and realized the reason why water was coming out of my nose every time I rinsed was because I had an oral antral fistula on one of the top sockets. That basically means there was a new opening between my mouth and my sinus cavity where the tooth used to be. I was going to post a picture here, but it's pretty disgusting looking. Google it if you're interested. I called to tell him that I had the fistula and he was skeptical of my self diagnosis AGAIN. Seriously, dude? Medical professionals, please try to work with your patients - we are the  most  informed about our own bodies, not you. I went back and believe it or not, I was right. He gave me a couple shots of local anesthetic and sewed the hole up. I went back a week later and got the stitches removed. By that time, 80% of the pain had subsided and I no longer had water coming out of my nose from my mouth. Success at last! I'm not sure it gets any worse than that for wisdom tooth removal. I don't even want to imagine what it would have been like with a local anesthetic. 17.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question   Rutledge Wayne , studied at Harvard University (1902) Answered Apr 13, 2017 A lot of people when they’re early twenties or late teens go to the dentist for wisdom teeth extraction . However, this isn’t something that everyone has to have done. Even though dentists have different opinions regarding whether it’s necessary to have this done, if you’re thinking it’s a good idea to have yours removed, you should talk to your dentist. Good Reasons to Have Them Removed Even though oral surgery sounds scary, when you have them removed it can be often better in the long run than leaving them in. Because leaving them unaddressed can cause greater pain and discomfort down the road. But a lot of people don’t have any problems when their teeth break through and therefore they won’t need to have the procedure. Even with this knowledge, a lot of dental professionals make the recommendation that they have them removed if you’re having the following problems. They’re not fitting properly – Most people have room for approximately 28 teeth, and that’s the number you’ll have before the eruption of your wisdom teeth. With the addition of four more teeth, you now have 32 teeth and they’re fitting into a space that fits just 28 teeth. When your jaw isn’t big enough, those teeth can be impacted and they don’t erupt fully or they are misaligned. If this happens, having them pulled will make sure that your other teeth have enough room. You are having gum pain all the time near the wisdom teeth – The pain you are experiencing might mean you have an infection which could be happening from wisdom teeth that have been partially erupted. When bacteria and food are trapped inside these areas, it can cause a really painful infection called pericoronitis . When you have those teeth pulled, it can prevent any further infection. They’re coming in crooked – If your teeth fully come in but they’re coming in sideways, your teeth might move and shift as time goes by. There’s also a possibility that crooked teeth can harm your nearby teeth. After you’ve had the teeth pulled, you’ll have your other teeth protected. There’s a cyst around the tooth – This will happen when the sac beside the tooth fills with fluid. Anytime this happens, it may destroy any surrounding structures like tooth roots or bone. In really rare cases, untreated cysts can result in tumors that may require surgical procedures that are more serious.

Undo   Andy Green , I share oral hygiene tips Answered Jan 9, 2018 I interviewed a few different family members over thanksgiving ranging from 17 to 68 years old and it turned out only me and my mother had not had theirs removed. In my case, I still have them but have not been bothered by their presence. In my mother’s case, she never developed any which explains why they were never removed. I started looking into the purpose of third molars, or wisdom teeth, and why we remove them…or don’t. Scientists have determined that our third molars were once detrimental to the digestion of our ancestors. Because our diet consisted of course, rough foods like leaves, roots, nuts and meats which needed to be ground before swallowed, those additional teeth were need for chewing power. Naturally, with evolution, our diets began to change and so did our body. Our jaws are much smaller than they used to be, and our diet now consists of softer less nutrient rich foods. In early childhood we feed babies and children out of bottles, then sippy cups, then self-dissolving crackers, then apple sauce….you get the point. Some say they we also lack the nutrient vitamin K2 — commonly found in liver and organ meat as well as animal products from animals that eat grass, not corn or grains. This in combination with the fact we now cut our food before chewing has in turn caused our jaws to be under developed. Not only have our third molars lost their use, but they also do not have space to grow. Since we no longer have use or space for these teeth, they tend to grow in perpendicular to the healthy teeth neighboring. If the teeth begin to erupt into the roots of the adjacent teeth it will damage the healthy teeth to which point both will need removal. This is why doctors & dentist in Amherst suggest extracting wisdom teeth before any damage can be done. I have provided an x-ray of my teeth so that you can see what it looks like when there is no room for them and how close they are to teeth roots next door. Although I do not feel the need to extract them if I allow them to continue growing they may cause more damage. In my mother’s case, she is part of the 35% of humans born without wisdom teeth at all. This now brings us to the procedure itself. Not everyone will need IV sedation but it is an option my office, dental clinic in Amherst offers. Once you have an evaluation they will tell you how invasive the procedure will be and if conscious sedation is right for you. In many cases patients will only need local anesthetic. If the tooth is fully erupted the dentist will extract the tooth using forceps and/or elevators. If the tooth in impacted in the jaw and has not come through the gum, a small incision will be made in the gum and a small piece of bone will also be removed to access the tooth. The dentist will then widen the tooth socket by rocking the tooth back and forth before taking it out. The area will be numb so this will not cause any paid but the patient will feel a great deal of pressure while the dentist removes the tooth. Finally the dentist will place dissolving stiches where the incision was made, sealing the gum line. After proper care instruction is given they will send you on your way….commence embarrassing videotaping.

Most often, the reason wisdom teeth need to be removed is because there is severe inflammation of the gum in between the teeth and decay occurring in the adjacent teeth due to poor oral hygiene in the hard to reach area. If you're able to floss properly , and have no trouble reaching into the very back of your mouth to clean in between your wisdom and adjacent teeth, then it is unlikely that your wisdom teeth with cause you any problems. If the wisdom tooth is not causing any pain whatsoever, and is not causing any discomfort such as causing you to bite your cheek , then there is no emergency in taking it out. However - If the tooth is causing discomfort, is impacting other teeth, or is protruding in such a way where it affects your bite , or is causing you to bite your cheek, then it might need to be taken out, if adjustment is not possible. If adjustment is possible, there are several treatment options such as braces, Clear alignment systems such as Invisalign Orthosnap or Six Months Smiles a system which uses cosmetic braces and concentrates on correcting the alignment of the teeth.

Here’s when and why wisdom teeth has to be removed. Your wisdom teeth don’t fit in your mouth. Most of us have room for about 28 teeth, which is the number of teeth you have before your wisdom teeth erupt. When you add your four wisdom teeth, you have 32 teeth all trying to fit into the confined amount of space available in your jaw. When the jaw isn’t large enough, the wisdom teeth can become impacted, which means they are either unable to fully erupt or they become misaligned. In this case, having your wisdom teeth pulled will ensure all your teeth have ample room. You experience chronic pain in your gums near your wisdom teeth. This pain can be a sign of infection that can occur from partially erupted wisdom teeth. When food and bacteria get trapped in these areas, it can lead to a very painful infection known as pericoronitis. Having your wisdom teeth pulled in this case will prevent further infection. Your wisdom teeth don’t come in straight. If your wisdom teeth come in fully, but come in sideways, they can cause your teeth to shift and move over time. There is also a chance that poorly aligned wisdom teeth can damage the nearby teeth. Once you have your wisdom teeth pulled, your nearby teeth will be protected from damage. A cyst forms around the wisdom tooth. This occurs when the sac next to the tooth becomes filled with fluid. When this occurs, it can destroy the surrounding structures such as bone or tooth roots. In rare cases, an untreated cyst can lead to a tumor that may require a more serious surgical procedure.

Even though they may not be bothering you now, there are several reasons to undergo wisdom teeth removal before an actual problem crops up. Here is what you must consider with your dentist before you decide on what to do about your wisdom teeth: Are they causing problems for you now? Problems, meaning a cavity or soft tissue irritation that can cause incomplete mouth opening, it may not currently be an issue for you, but it can develop into a problem later. Can you clean them well? The incomplete eruption of the teeth into the mouth can create pockets of tissue that collect bacteria around your wisdom teeth. Their position at the back of your mouth can make them really hard to clean too. It is imperative that you can thoroughly clean your wisdom teeth (and the rest of your teeth) because infections involving the wisdom teeth are a leading cause of multi-space infections, which can spread to the head and neck. Are they fully out already? Due to their location and the time of the eruption, usually between age 17–25, often there is not enough room. When that happens, wisdom teeth may erupt into places where they are interfering with the normal jaw function. This interference can cause pain in the TMJ (the joint of your jaws) later on. Also, you might not be able to open your mouth completely. Any opposing tooth contacting your wisdom teeth when you bite? Not everyone has all 4 of their wisdom teeth. There are many cases where wisdom teeth grow in the mouth without a tooth in the opposite arch to come in contact with during biting. This may not seem like a problem; however, without that feedback a tooth can super-erupt (growing higher than the teeth alongside) and cause occlusal interferences. They might also rub against soft tissue and cause irritation. Is it impacted? Such situation can create soft tissue pockets, depending on the degree and direction of impaction. Not only that, the wisdom teeth can push the roots of your other good teeth causing resorption (the root disintegrates). Everyone can notice a problem when there are active symptoms. However, if there are signs of an impending problem, why wait? Another good reason to decide earlier rather than later is that the bone around your teeth will mature. This might make wisdom teeth more difficult to remove as you get older.

You KNOW WHAT this always does not happen, because third molars are UNPREDICTABLE . That’s why your dentist told to remove your wisdom teeth. Why should wisdom teeth be removed?

If they are impacted and/or cause crowding in your teeth, a dentist will recommend that you have them removed. There are two ways wisdom teeth may grow. 1. Some will grow in like regular teeth 2. Some will become impacted. If the wisdom teeth have grown in and don’t hurt, then the decision is up to you. Wisdom teeth that cause minimal crowding and don’t hurt are fine to keep, but a lot of dentists will recommend that they be removed. Why? They are very susceptible to cavities and are not easily  cleansable. If your wisdom teeth have cavities and you cannot clean them due to their location, filling the cavities is unwise because you’ll continue to develop more cavities. The easiest way to avoid this problem is to remove the wisdom teeth altogether.

Although they may not be bothering you now, there are several reasons to have them removed before an actual problem crops up. Here is what you must consider with your doctor before you decide on what to do about your wisdom teeth: Are they currently causing soft tissue irritation or have a cavity? It may not bother you now, but it can become a problem later  on. Can you effectively keep them clean? Lack of complete eruption of the teeth into the mouth can create pockets of tissue that collect bacteria around your wisdom teeth. Also their location in the back of your mouth can make them difficult to clean. It is very important that you are able to fully clean your wisdom teeth (and the rest of your teeth) because infections involving wisdom teeth are a leading cause of multi-space infections that spread to areas around your head and neck. Are they in proper occlusion and is there room for them? Due to their location and the age at which they grow into the mouth, often times there is not enough room for wisdom teeth in the mouth and they may grow into  place where they are interfering with the normal function of your jaws. This interference can create pain in the TMJ (the joint of your jaws) down the road. Is there an opposing tooth contacting your wisdom teeth when you bite down? Not everyone has all 4 of their wisdom teeth. Many times wisdom teeth grow into the mouth without a tooth in the opposite dental arch to come in contact with during biting. This may not seem like a problem; however, without that feedback a tooth can supererupt (grow higher than surrounding teeth) and cause occlusal interferences, and rub against soft tissue causing irritation. Is it impacted? Depending on the type and severity of impaction, this can create soft tissue pockets as before and also push on the roots of your other good teeth causing resorption (the root disintegrates). A lot of times impacted teeth can just be left alone, but it really depends on what the impacted tooth is doing. Everyone can identify a problem when there are active symptoms. However, if there are signs that a major problem is coming down the road, why wait? Another reason to decide sooner rather than later, is that the bone around your teeth will mature with age and can make  wisdom teeth more difficult to remove as you get older. 73.5k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Will Wister   Murry Shohat , Deeply experienced, widely published reporter & editor.

The answer for any specific person is both age and anatomy-driven With the availability of precision 3D diagnostic tools, such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), dentists now have an evidence-based method to advise patients on wisdom teeth removal. There is no longer a guessing game as patients mature into their adult anatomy. With CBCT evidence, dental radiologists and trained dentists can see the direction your wisdom teeth are headed. No pain now is hardly predictive of the future, but the reformattable imagery of CBCT provides predictive insight. There’s more info here .

Consult with one to get complete information on the process to make the most informed decision. 6k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  William Chen   Marc Bodnick , Co-Founder at Telepath Updated Jul 7, 2010 · Upvoted by  Scott Frey , Board Certified Orthodontist @freysmiles.com · Author has 7.8k answers and 40m answer views If your dentist tells you that you'll need your wisdom teeth out eventually, you should have this surgery done before you reach your late 20s. If you are over age 25 when the impacted teeth are removed, you have a greater chance of complications (e.g., dry socket), because of the increased density and reduced flexibility of the bone. Wisdom teeth removal can be much more painful / complicated, with longer recovery times, when you get into your late 20s/30s. Good quote from the AAOMS website ( www.aaoms.org/wisdom_teeth.php): It isn't wise to wait until your wisdom teeth start to bother you. In general, earlier removal of wisdom teeth results in a less complicated healing process. The AAOMS/OMSF study strongly recommends that wisdom teeth be removed by the time the patient is a young adult in order to prevent future problems and to ensure optimal healing. The researchers found that older patients may be at greater risk for disease, including periodontitis, in the tissues surrounding the third molars and adjacent teeth. Periodontal infections, such as those observed in this study, may affect your general health. 14.8k Views · View Upvoters   Albert Sheu , works at Quora Answered Feb 10, 2010 · Author has 329 answers and 1.4m answer views From personal experience, I would remove them even in a non-emergency. When I was younger the dentist told me that I had non-impacted wisdom teeth, and so it wasn't required that I remove them. However, by the time I was 21 or so, I started getting extremely intense pain in random spots in my mouth. As it turns out, the pain was referred pain from the highly infected wisdom teeth, given that it's much harder to keep them clean. Eventually the surgeon determined that I needed to get all four out at the same time, which I finally did. I have particularly bad luck with my teeth, but it's not worth dealing with the complications. Impacted teeth are another beast in itself, and can risk other teeth to become misaligned. It's also worthwhile to do it while young, when your ability to recover from the surgery is much greater. 8.8k Views · View Upvoters   Anne Fletcher-Jones , No longer young, taking longer to heal!

Answered Dec 23, 2015 While impacted wisdom tooth does not need any treatment (if they are not causing any problems!), tooth extraction may be needed to treat the impacted wisdom tooth. Performed in a dentist’s office, this removal of wisdom tooth is usually handled by an oral surgeon.   Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics in case of infection. Often, over-the-counter pain relievers are enough to tackle the discomfort caused. Doctors also suggest gargles of warm salt water or mouthwashes that provide instant relief for impacted wisdom tooth infection.  The very first thing dentists recommend is to get the impacted teeth removed if they are causing problems. It is either performed by a dentist or an oral surgeon based on the severity of the impacted wisdom tooth infection.  While removal is apt for getting rid of all the problems, some dentists recommend the wisdom teeth should be removed in advance so that they do not result in problems later. It’s like the old adage, ‘prevention is better than sure’.

The teeth could be stuck, or impacted. That means they can’t break through your jaw and into your mouth. Maybe your mouth is too small to make room for them, or the teeth could be growing at an angle to other teeth. They can damage the tooth next door if they push up against it. Some dentists take out healthy molars to prevent problems later on. As you age, the bones in your mouth get harder. That makes your teeth tougher to remove. If you wait, you could have problems after surgery that range from heavy bleeding and fractured teeth to severe numbness and minor loss of movement in your jaw. These troubles could last a few days or a lifetime.

This is caused when there is no enough room for the wisdom teeth; hence they grow at odd angles. So, if you feel like wisdom teeth are coming in, then makes sure there is no potential issue by consulting a dentist. In this article, we have compiled the four major reasons why your wisdom teeth may have to be extracted by a dentist. They are Erupting at Odd Angles If your wisdom teeth grow up straight and do not interfere with the rest of your smile, then it’s growing in the right direction. But, in case, if the third molars are coming in at an angle pushing through the gums horizontally, then proper attention should be given to avoid any future complications. They are Partially Erupted The wisdom teeth are not fully erupted due to some blockages in the eruption area. In these cases, the wisdom teeth should be removed because it may attract bad bacteria and become infected, swollen and painful. Orthodontic Treatment For patients wearing braces, the erupted wisdom teeth will apply pressure to the other teeth toward the front of the mouth, causing crowding or pain. To avoid such painful circumstances, the wisdom teeth should be removed to ensure a successful orthodontic treatment. Gum Disease It’s recommended for patients with gum disease to extract wisdom teeth because the infection in the gum spreads and infects the impacted wisdom teeth that are struggling to come out of the gum line. This causes extreme pain and discomfort.

Answered Jul 7, 2010 · Author has 231 answers and 643.8k answer views The right answer is "it all depends". We see many impacted teeth, most of which will not cause any problems. My personal rule for wisdom teeth are: If it is infected or it hurts, take it out. If it has a cavity, and there is no great reason to save it, take it out. If the wisdom tooth has broken through the gum, or if you are somehow catching food there, take it out before you have a problem. With wisdom teeth, we are trying to save you from more pain and more problems down the road. 9.7k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Will Wister   Taran Preet , Web Design &Digital Marketing Consultant, Health Blog Writer Answered Jan 23, 2018 · Author has 122 answers and 6.6k answer views Even if you have a wisdom tooth that is not bothering you, deciding on what to do with it depends on the dental examination done by a dentist.

Many patients have smaller mouths and jaws, which do not allow room for the third molars to grow in properly. If these teeth do erupt, overcrowding can occur.

(Photo: PhotoDisc) Story Highlights Wisdom teeth are often misaligned Those third molars emerge at ages 17 to 25 There is now a more nuanced message about handling those teeth CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE For decades, having wisdom teeth removed was a rite of passage – one many high school graduates squeezed in before leaving for college. The thinking was that it was best to lose those mostly useless, ill-fitting teeth before they caused infections or other trouble.  Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, often are misaligned and impacted – fully or partly stuck below the gum line – because they emerge late, at ages 17 to 25, after the jaw has stopped growing and other teeth have filled the mouth. "Historically, oral surgeons have had the view that it's better to take them out, better to be safe than sorry," says Richard Niederman, director of the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry at the Forsyth Institute, Cambridge, Mass. But parents, teens and young adults can expect a more nuanced message these days.  In a nutshell: some healthy wisdom teeth may be OK to keep, as long as you undergo regular exams and X-rays to catch signs of trouble, according to the latest recommendations from the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. That group represents the 9,000 surgeons who remove most wisdom teeth in the United States. Some critics of routine wisdom tooth extraction go further: They say it's best to keep most of the teeth and avoid the risks of anesthesia and surgery. "There might be some justification for removing 30%," says Jay Friedman, a California dentist who has been a consultant to insurers and a witness in dental malpractice cases. In a report published in 2007 in the American Journal of Public Health , Friedman called the removal of some 10 million wisdom teeth each year "a public health hazard."  He focused on the harm the surgeries could cause, from infections to nerve damage. At Friedman's urging, the American Public Health Association in 2008 adopted a policy opposing the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. But in a position paper in 2011, the oral surgeon's group said that policy was "based on an unscientific extrapolation of data." The group laid out evidence that most symptom-free wisdom teeth were not disease-free. "About two-thirds of the time, there's going to be some problem," most often gum disease or cavities, says Raymond P. White Jr., an oral surgery professor at the University of North Carolina. But the surgeon's group has revised advice on truly  trouble-free teeth.  A web page for consumers , updated in 2012, says that "wisdom teeth that are completely erupted and functional, painless, cavity-free, in a hygienic environment with healthy gum tissue, and are disease-free may not require extraction."  It says patients and doctors should discuss options, ranging from removal to regular monitoring. That can be a complicated discussion, says Thomas Dodson, an oral surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.  He says that while one in three wisdom teeth seen by oral surgeons is disease-free, all the teeth are healthy in just 10% of patients.  So patients may be deciding whether to keep some teeth but not others. Still, those healthy teeth pose a dilemma, he says, because there's no good evidence on whether it's better to remove or retain them. Immediate surgery has risks, he says. About one in 20 patients develops an infection, one in 100 has hard-to-control bleeding and another one in 100 loses some feeling in the lips or tongue, usually but not always temporarily, he says. But keeping the teeth may mean a more complicated surgery later. It also means spending time and money on regular exams and X-rays. The problem, Dodson says, is that no one can predict which teeth will stay healthy. Given that unpredictability, the best course is leaving healthy teeth alone, especially since some impacted teeth will eventually emerge, Friedman says.  He also says the oral surgery group has stretched the definition of diseased wisdom teeth by including any that are surrounded by open pockets of 4 millimeters or more. While so-called periodontal pockets can collect harmful bacteria, their presence alone does not prove gums are diseased, he says. Stuart Froum, a periodontist in New York City and president-elect of the American Academy of Periodontology, agrees. Froum says he looks for swelling, bleeding and other signs to diagnose gum disease around any tooth.  When those signs appear around wisdom teeth, he says, patients may want to consult both surgeons and periodontists about whether the best course is extraction or other treatments, such as medications and trimming of tissue around the teeth. Dodson says he talks to patients about all options but recommends extraction when signs of gum disease are present.  He says most agree. Even when wisdom teeth are healthy, just 40% choose to keep them, he says. But patients already in a surgeon's office may not be typical. Since most referrals to oral surgeons come from general dentists, one just-completed study is looking at how often and why dentists recommend young people keep or get rid of wisdom teeth. Results have not yet been published, but the study will look at whether patients follow the advice and how they fare after two years, says researcher Greg Huang, chair of orthodontics at the University of Washington School of Dentistry. The American Dental Association referred questions about wisdom teeth to the oral surgery group. The association's website says "every patient is unique," but wisdom teeth may need to be removed for a number of reasons. The association also says wisdom teeth that are retained should be monitored for changes.

Posted under: Affordable Dental Care , Dental Tips , General | Posted on: March 18, 2014  Tweet    That third and final set of molars that emerge later in life in the deepest recesses of your mouth—named “wisdom teeth” as if they are a rite of passage into adulthood—can be a blemish in what might be an otherwise perfect dental record. Yes, these teeth disturb the oral health of a majority of individuals, requiring wisdom teeth removal. It is believed that “once upon a time” the wisdom teeth were essential to the caveman. Today, modern man seems to have little need for the teeth, much less space for them in the mouth. These teeth often emerge misaligned, crowding the other teeth, or hide partially below the surface of the gum line, stirring up damage to the jawbone or nerves, and causing wisdom teeth pain. Wisdom teeth removal has become a common procedure—nearly 85 percent of adults have had their wisdom teeth removed to protect their oral health. Wisdom teeth pain is not something to ignore. This can be a sign of crowding or impacted wisdom teeth. In either case, your oral health may be at stake and you should seek the advice of your dental care professional. Fully impacted wisdom teeth are enclosed within the soft tissue of the jawbone, while partially impacted wisdom teeth break partway through the gum line. A partial eruption often leaves an opening for bacterial growth around the tooth, leading to infection, tooth decay, or gum disease. These conditions are also associated with pain, swelling, jaw stiffness, and general illness. Your dentist will likely recommend prompt wisdom teeth removal to inhibit further development of adverse conditions or disease. If you are unsure about the state of your wisdom teeth—fully impacted teeth can’t be seen with the naked eye—ask your dentist. Periodic X-rays during routine dental care visits will allow you and your dentist to monitor your teeth. If the position of your teeth is already cause for concern, your dentist may recommend wisdom teeth removal or refer you to an oral surgeon for further evaluation. Many times, dentists and oral surgeons will recommend removal to avoid future problems. Although your wisdom teeth may not be causing you trouble now, wisdom teeth removal becomes a risky procedure late in life. Younger people tend to have wisdom teeth roots that have not fully developed and the bone is less dense, making removal easier. Older people, however, often have a longer healing time and more intense recovery. Wisdom Teeth Removal Removal of wisdom teeth is often an outpatient procedure, performed at the dentist’s or oral surgeon’s office. The ease of the procedure varies case by case, largely depending on the position of the teeth at time of removal. Your dental care provider can make you aware of what to expect when you have your exam before the procedure. Your dental care professional will use a local anesthetic to numb any pain that might occur during the surgery. If necessary, your dentist may sedate you as well. The teeth will then be carefully extracted, minimizing disturbance to the bone and optimizing your long-term oral health.

Should they be removed? When and why?            Should they be removed? When and why?   Wisdom teeth or third molars are the teeth furthest away in the dental arches and they are usually the last ones to erupt… if they ever come out!  For their eruption to occur normally, there must be sufficient growth at the back of the jaws to accommodate these teeth. For most people who have all their permanent teeth, this happens rarely and wisdom teeth fail to erupt.  Growth of the lower jaw occurs mostly at the back and this growth is essential to allow the eruption of the third molars (circle). If growth is inadequate, wisdom teeth will remain impacted.  It is very rare to see someone with the maximum possible of 32 teeth in the mouth (including wisdom teeth) that are optimally aligned and functional.  Teeth that have not completed their eruption within a reasonable time are called “ impacted ” if they are completely submerged under the gum and “ semi-impacted ” if they pierce through the gum only partially.  The dental community agrees to recommend the extraction of third molars that are symptomatic or cause problems (pain, infection, damage to other teeth, etc.).       We can have up to 32 teeth in the mouth including wisdom teeth (*), but it is very rare to see a dentition with all the teeth positioned in an esthetic and functional way, as in this case. (This dentition was treated orthodontically.)   But what about impacted teeth that are asymptomatic ? Wisdom teeth have historically been blamed for many problems. They are accused, among other things, to cause tooth movement by exerting pressure on other teeth when trying to erupt. This would be responsible for the movement of other teeth and the increase in dental crowding and rotation of the anterior teeth with time. Is this “ popular belief ” justified?   Studies have shown that, although they may play a small role in these tooth movements in late adolescence and later, they are not the main cause and several other more important factors, such as residual growth must be considered.  Even when third molars are extracted, it is common to see anterior dental movements occur thereafter.  Therefore, several associations of dental professionals (orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons) have concluded that it is inappropriate to extract third molars only to prevent unwanted dental movements.  Removing third molars will not prevent lower anterior dental crowding. But this doesn’t mean that there are not other reasons to extract third molars. There are many…  However, a semi-impacted tooth or a tooth presenting signs of pathologies represents a risk of serious problems. Such a tooth can be compared to a “time bomb” in the patient’s mouth; you don’t really know when it will “explode”!       Examples of impacted third molars that can only be seen with the help of radiographs.   There are, however, several other reasons to extract third molars.   For example, if they have symptoms , such as pain, infection, have caries, are difficult to clean, have a severe malposition, etc., it is best to remove them.  It is almost always indicated to extract a tooth that is “ semi-impacted ” because it presents a higher risk of infection and decay in the mid or long term.  In summary, it is frequently indicated to extract wisdom teeth that do not come out, but the reason is mainly to solve a problem already affecting these teeth or to prevent the development of pathologies (cysts, tumors, resorption (wear) of adjacent teeth).  Extraction is not intended to prevent the movements of other teeth over time.     Although both lower third molars of this 24-year-old woman are partially erupted, they are partially covered with gum tissue (semi-impacted) and difficult to clean. They have become decayed within only a few months of their eruption (arrows and dark areas on X-rays show decay). It is preferable to extract these third molars before the problem worsens.   However, if you prefer to keep asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth , do not ignore them.   It is strongly recommended to have regular radiographic assessments made (every 3-4 years) to detect the onset of potential problems as described above.  Symptoms affecting third molars can occur long after the appearance of a problem and, at that time, significant damage is often already present and irreversible.  Several authors suggest that uninfected and symptom free wisdom teeth may remain indefinitely in the mouth in adults. (Zachrisson 2005)   Note that it is rarely necessary to extract third molars as part of an orthodontic treatment. However this may be necessary if, for example, those teeth would interfere with the normal eruption of another molar (second molar) or prevent the movement of teeth towards the back of the mouth. Another exception would be when a jaw surgery, such as a mandibular advancement, is planned ( orthognathic surgery ). In such a case, the oral surgeon will prefer to extract the lower wisdom teeth at least six months prior to the surgery in order to avoid a “bad split” of the mandible during the surgical intervention.  We like to use the “jack-in-the-box” analogy to try to describe certain unpredictable dentition problems and behaviors. Wisdom teeth are well suited for this comparison; it is hard to predict if they will come out and if so, how and when. They are full of surprises!    Examples of third molar eruption problems        Impacted upper and lower third molars leaning against the second molars in a 21-year-old male. There are even 2 upper wisdom teeth on the right radiograph! These molars will not erupt and can damage other teeth.       Impacted wisdom teeth (upper and lower third molars) located under the second molars that started to resorb the roots of the second molars to such an extent that both third AND second molars had to be extracted. (courtesy of Dr G. Noreau)             Upper third molar eruption problems. Only a radiograph can detect this anomaly (25-year-old woman). These teeth will not erupt adequately and their extreme malposition justifies their extraction. The tooth on the picture on the right can damage the second molar if it stays in the mouth.       A routine radiograph in this 13-year-old patient reveals impacted lower wisdom teeth that are almost not formed but overlap the roots of the second molars, which could damage them in the long term. It would be indicated to extract them before the formation of their roots is too advanced. Note that such situation can be asymptomatic for the patient.        Predicting the eruption of wisdom teeth   The main way to assess the presence and position of third molars is to take a panoramic radiograph and evaluate certain factors, such as the size of the teeth, the formation of their roots, the direction of eruption, the available space, the jaw bone, etc.  In an attempt to predict the eruption of third molars, several methods have been developed. Some are very ingenious and original, but none has proven to be accurate every time. Some are very simple while others rely on fancy calculations of tooth position and evaluation of future growth.  But… despite the availability of several analytical methods, predicting which teeth will erupt adequately or not is sometimes just a lucky guess!     Look at the following examples of radiographs that show the behavior of wisdom teeth over many years.  Who could have predicted what happened?  Note: The letters represent the patient’s initials and the numbers are the patient’s age at the time the radiographs were taken.        (A) A wisdom tooth was visible on a radiograph, far behind the second premolar as early as 11 years of age. (B) 3 years later, this tooth seems farther away. (C) After a few years, the impacted molar migrated forward and seems to be on the right path to erupt. Who could have guessed? To be continued…      Change in the position of wisdom teeth from age 15 to 21    Evolution of the position of lower wisdom teeth during a 6-year period. As soon as the teeth will obviously not come out properly, it would be preferable to extract them to avoid a more complex intervention (extraction) later on (for the patient and the surgeon).    (A) At 15 years of age, the lower wisdom teeth are already tilted forward.  (B) 3 years later, the teeth tip more forward. There is not enough growth at the back of the mandible to allow the impacted molars to upright and erupt. It would be indicated to extract these molars at this time because it is impossible for these teeth to come out properly. The upper wisdom teeth continue growing, but the left one stays blocked behind the second molar.  (C) At 21 years of age, the lower wisdom teeth are positioned horizontally, which will make their extraction more complicated.  (D) Upper right third molar once extracted.  (E) Upper left third molar.  (F and G) The lower third molars had to be cut in several pieces to be extracted. The maxillofacial surgeons’ skills still allow the extraction of teeth in a very bad position, but these extractions are a lot more complex for both the patient and the surgeon. It is thus preferable to extract impacted wisdom teeth as soon as they are considered to have no chance whatsoever to erupt and before the impaction worsens and makes the intervention more difficult.     Other considerations in the decision to remove or retain third molars  Absence of opposing teeth    It is indicated to extract wisdom teeth that have no opposing tooth (*) in the lower arch, even if they erupt.           When a tooth is partially out, the gingiva covering it is an area where plaque and food debris can accumulate and cause infection, inflammation and tooth decay. It is then indicated to either uncover such a tooth by removing the excess gum tissue or to extract it if the tooth cannot be properly uncovered to help it complete its eruption.       A semi-impacted third molar is more difficult to clean which makes it more susceptible to dental caries. This tooth shows an incipient carious lesion in the surface groove.       Misleading images!     Sometimes, the clinical examination gives the impression that the eruption of wisdom teeth occurs well or normally, but the radiological examination reveals a whole different reality.      (A) The lower right wisdom tooth of this 24-year-old woman came through the gum tissue several months before, but its eruption does not seem to progress anymore.     (B) Although this tooth appears to erupt normally, a radiograph reveals the severe horizontal malposition of this tooth.  The visible part in the mouth (circled) is in fact the back of the tooth that is tipped forward. This semi-impacted tooth will certainly be problematic one day (infection, cavities, etc.), so it is indicated to extract it.  As described previously, the reason to recommend the extraction is not the risk of seeing this tooth displace the other teeth in front of it, but rather the fact that it could get infected and cause problems in this area of the mouth.   Presence of damaged teeth  When a wisdom tooth has little chance of coming out and another tooth in front of it is severely damaged to the point where major restorations will be necessary later on, it could be logical to extract the damaged tooth and “recuperate” the wisdom tooth. In such a situation, it is beneficial to postpone the decision to extract a third molar if an orthodontic treatment is envisioned. Extracting the wisdom tooth would force the patient to restore the damaged tooth or replace it if it were to be extracted eventually.    Not having extracted an impacted wisdom tooth very early made it possible to recuperate it and eliminate a severely damaged molar.   (A and C) 15-year-old teenager with a lower left molar (black * asterisk) that is severely compromised by a root canal treatment. Extracting this molar made it possible to recuperate the impacted and tipped wisdom tooth (red *) and close the space remaining following the extraction by moving the other molars forward (arrow).  (B and D) After the corrections, the space created by the extraction is completely closed , the wisdom tooth (third molar) came out, uprighted and is now functional. The green asterisk (*) indicates where the wisdom tooth was. This patient thus avoided the necessity to have a crown which, since he was very young, would have required to be replaced several times throughout his life.   Do all third molars need to be extracted?     Sometimes, a single wisdom tooth seems problematic and must be extracted. What about the other third molars that stay in the mouth? Should they necessarily be extracted as well? To learn more about it, consult our Ortho-blog column “ Do all third molars need to be extracted? ” describing certain points to take into consideration to decide which wisdom teeth need to be extracted .        The behavior of wisdom teeth is hard to predict. It answers a very complex “equation” with several variables. Each of them can influence individually or together the symptoms and evolution of the eruption of teeth.    Lack of symptoms doesn’t mean lack of disease   Many studies have concluded that symptom free wisdom teeth do not always mean disease free teeth as there are many types of infections which can be developing over time around these teeth. Very often he decision to extract or not  it is a judgment call on the part of the practitioner but when you look at the pros and cons long term, it is probably safer to extract borderline problematic wisdom tooth instead of hanging on to them in the hope that nothing happens.  For further information, see this short scientific article: Evaluation and management of asymptomatic third molars : lack of symptoms does not equate to lack of pathology. 1    The influence of wisdom teeth on stability of teeth   Dental crowding is a normal and unavoidable phenomenon throughout the years. The age at which it will occur, the severity of crowing and where it will occur may vary from one person to another and this will happen whether an orthodontic treatment was performed or not. The teeth that are most often affected are the lower anterior teeth (incisors and canines), but all the other teeth may move as well.  Wisdom teeth have often been blamed in order to try to find a cause to undesirable tooth movements or displacements that occur after the end of an orthodontic treatment. Numerous researches and studies were published on this subject, but the conclusion from the most serious sources is that the third molars that erupt at the back of the dental arches do not significantly cause these displacements.  Such displacements may occur and will likely occur whether an orthodontic treatment was performed or not. The question should then not be “ IF ” teeth will move but rather “ WHEN ” they will move. 🙁  To learn more on orthodontic retention and the influence of wisdom teeth on the stability of teeth .

I wasn't in pain. They were somewhat impacted, or growing in at a bit of an angle. My parents decided to go ahead with the surgery to remove them anyway. "There was a lot of blood," the doctors told me first thing after waking up — i.e.,  hemorrhaging. That, and the lingering effects of anesthesia, explained why, for the next several hours, I had to be rolled around in a wheelchair. The following weeks involved a mostly liquid diet and lots of pudding. I hate pudding. The inside of my mouth, as one friend aptly put it, resembled a "lunar landscape." And it hurt. My then-frail teenage body was not prepared to handle intensive surgery. Even as my mouth slowly began to heal, my body did not respond to the ordeal well, and I caught pneumonia. This entailed temperatures of 103 degrees and fever dreams of fighting the Nazis on Normandy beaches. I have never been sicker in my life. And after researching this topic further, I am now convinced that the wisdom teeth industry is probably a scam. Advertisement As of 2011, 10 million wisdom teeth get hacked out of the back of Americans' mouths a year. For decades, the procedure was performed only when the teeth, also known as third molars, were causing real trouble, like in the case of appendectomies. After World War II, however, the ranks of dentists exploded, and with them recommendations that people get their third molars removed as a precaution. As dental care got more advanced—and the financial incentive to perform the procedures increased—wisdom teeth removal began to become as routine as getting braces. Advertisement Today, many still undergo this procedure for legitimate reasons: ingrown or impacted wisdom teeth can lead to infections, tooth decay, and generally unpleasant levels of pain . But a large percentage of patients choose to undergo this act of sawing, bleeding, and stitching merely as a precaution, often putting up more than $1,000 for the experience. This is not entirely surprising: America excels at  ordering up unnecessary medical procedures. It's an epidemic: By one count, Americans waste $750 billion a year on unproductive care , more than our nation’s entire budget for K–12 education. For 30 years, Dr. Jay Friedman has been on a one-man crusade to halt the tide of wisdom teeth removal, which he says is one of the most egregious examples of unnecessary medical procedures. In 2007, Friedman published a study in which he estimated that at least two-thirds of the millions of wisdom teeth extracted each year could or should have stayed in, but were instead removed out of unfounded fears of what would happen otherwise. Advertisement In Friedman's estimation, you risk more enduring complications from wisdom teeth removal surgery than just leaving the suckers in your mouth. Consider this list of potential complications from wisdom teeth removal surgery: Friedman "It is specious to contend that less than 3 days of temporary discomfort or disability is a small price to pay to avoid the future risks of root [destruction], serious infections, and cysts," he wrote in his paper. "Also ignored is the risk of incidental injury such as broken jaws, fractured teeth, damage to the [mouth] joints, temporary and, especially, permanent paresthesia or dysesthesia (numbness and dysfunction of the lower lip and the tongue)." Advertisement Friedman is not a lone voice crying in the dental wilderness. A 2002 paper published in the Journal of the Canadian Dental Association estimated that the complication rate from wisdom teeth surgery was between 7% and 10%. A 2011 study of more than 6,000 patients in Greece found that only 2.7% of in-tact wisdom teeth result in problems . And an older study often cited by critics of routine extraction found that only 12% of surveyed middle-aged patients experienced a complication from keeping impacted wisdom teeth. And then there's the specter—rare, but possible—of death. Sydney Galleger, a teen in Minnesota, had just finished her junior year of high school last summer when she went under. Everything seemed to be going well until the very end, when Sydney's blood pressure shot up, her pulse dropped, and she went into cardiac arrest . Press  coverage  of Galleger's death pointed the finger squarely at her wisdom teeth removal procedure. An autopsy did not do much to dispel this as the main cause. Advertisement In the face of all of this, the other side of the debate maintains that, in fact, there is no debate. At the center is the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), the doctors who specialize in wisdom teeth removal. In a just released white paper , the association gave this policy statement on the procedure: …while not all third molars require surgical management, given the documented high incidence of problems associated with third molars over time, all patients should be evaluated by someone experienced and expert in third molar management. As evidence of this "high incidence of problems," they point to a review that looked at seven papers examining what happened when young adults left their wisdom teeth in. The review concluded that the risk of having to undergo removal appeared to increase as subjects aged. Advertisement But at least one of the studies in the AAOMS' review concluded no such thing. Rather, the British study found that 83.13% of patients survived the one-year study period symptom-free, and just 5% had to have teeth removed. Indeed, Britain's National Health Service now advises the following on wisdom teeth removal : Your wisdom teeth don't usually need to be removed if they're impacted but aren't causing any problems. This is because there's no proven benefit of doing this and it carries the risk of complications. Advertisement Even if they're impacted! Another study published in 2006 by the Cardiff University in Wales found a slightly higher incidence of teeth eventually having to be removed, but also concluded that there was "little support for the reintroduction of prophylactic removal of wisdom teeth," referring to the already declining practice in the region. Dr. Julia Boughner, a cell biologist at the University of Saskatchewan, has been following the debate closely for about five years since she opened a research lab to look into how human jaws evolved. In 2013, she published an article on the state of the debate, writing: …Evidence directly linking third molars to oral diseases is lacking. Further, it is not clear if the age-associated risk of disease 23 (i.e., the older the patient, the greater the apparent risk posed by impacted third molars) is simply due to the increased likelihood of bacterial accumulation and tissue inflammation with time. Advertisement At a minimum, she told me, there remains a distinct absence of comprehensive, unbiased studies on the wisdom teeth question. "The trick is that clinicians still don't have all the tools and data available that would make them comfortable with a sit-and-wait approach," she said. In a 2011 New York Times story on this debate, health writer Roni Caryn Rabin said that the price of leaving your teeth in was that you'll have to be extra fastidious about your own dental care, with frequent cleanings and X-rays if necessary. Advertisement If that's the price to pay for avoiding major surgery, it seems like a bargain. Rob covers business, economics and the environment for Fusion. He previously worked at Business Insider.

February 08, 1989 | By Jane E. Brody, New York Times News Service. Chances are that as soon as wisdom teeth begin struggling to emerge, a dentist will recommend that they come out. But should they? The wisdom of removing wisdom teeth before they cause trouble has long been debated. In only a small percentage of people do they grow in straight and healthy. The human jaw has been steadily decreasing in size for millennia and few people now have jaws large enough to accommodate four more teeth in the back of their mouths. As a result, many wisdom teeth grow in sideways, emerge only partway from the gum or remain impacted, forever trapped beneath it. According to recent estimates, 80 to 90 percent of Americans have at least one impacted ``third molar,`` as dentists call a wisdom tooth. If this were the end of the story, there would be no debate; unerupted wisdom teeth could just sit there in the gums. Unfortunately, in many patients (exactly how many no one really knows), malpositioned or impacted wisdom teeth eventually cause trouble. They may become infected or decayed, or they may damage adjacent teeth. Cysts and even cancers can form. Wait and see? The debate, then, is whether to remove improperly positioned wisdom teeth before such problems arise or wait until they do. While some specialists say, ``Don`t bother them until they bother you,`` most believe it is better to get malpositioned wisdom teeth out when you are young and healthy, since they are likely to cause trouble eventually. Both sides have good reasons for their views. The ``don`t bother them`` school cites the cost and discomfort of pulling teeth, some of which will never cause trouble. Those who advocate removal note that as patients age, the surgery becomes more difficult, the complications more numerous and the recovery more prolonged. In an effort to resolve the controversy, the National Institutes of Health held a conference in 1979. It was agreed that straight, healthy wisdom teeth should be left alone and that those that are diseased or causing trouble for other teeth should be removed. Differing opinions But the main issue, whether impacted but otherwise healthy wisdom teeth should be pulled to prevent trouble, was never resolved. ``The panel waffled on this issue,`` said Dr. Walter C. Guralnick, a cochairman of the meeting. After long discussion, the panel reluctantly agreed that ``impaction or malposition of a third molar is an abnormal state and may justify its removal.`` Guralnick, professor emeritus of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, explained recently that ``there has never been a good prospective study done to determine what percentage of people get into trouble if impacted wisdom teeth are left in place.`` No such study had begun before the 1979 conference and, despite the panel`s recommendation, none has been started since. Such a study would follow large numbers of people for many years to see what happens to their impacted wisdom teeth. Experts now have only one small study from which to judge; in it, most of the 60- to 70-year-olds who still had their wisdom teeth had no evident disease in their impacted teeth. Just as expected Not unexpectedly, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons recommends early removal of impacted wisdom teeth. Guralnick, who departs from this advice unless the teeth have partially emerged, nonetheless believes that the surgeons arrived at it honestly, using years of clinical experience as their basis. ``The economics of clinical practice is not the primary reason for the surgeons` view,`` he insisted. ``Oral surgeons today have enough other ways to earn a good living. They don`t depend on pulling wisdom teeth.`` Still, more than half of all Americans seem to wait until problems arise that force the issue, the oral surgeons report. The potential complications associated with malpositioned wisdom teeth are not in question. The only argument is about how likely the complications are to occur, especially if the teeth have not erupted through the gum. ``If wisdom teeth are partially emerged, symptoms eventually occur in more than 80 or 90 percent of cases,`` said Dr. Edwin D. Joy Jr., professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta. Common problems These are the most common complications of leaving malpositioned or impacted wisdom teeth in place: - Infection of the surrounding gum tissue. This condition, pericoronitis, is most likely to occur if the tooth is partially erupted or very close to the surface. - Fluid-filled cysts. These can form from remnants of tissue around the crown of the tooth, becoming large and painful. - Decay, or dental caries. The positioning of wisdom teeth makes them hard to clean and hard to repair. Decay is most likely if the teeth have erupted. 1 | 2 | Next    MORE: `They hated it': When `Trading Spaces' goes wrong Coffee Commercial Romance Grinds To A Halt Coping on land after surviving at sea   Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash: Her Daughter`s Account Cause of facial tingling can be very unnerving When one partner in a marriage doesn't want sex, what are options?

Prev  NEXT            Praying that the third molars won't form  Holloway/Riser/ Getty Images       For many of us, it may seem like our wisdom teeth didn't get the memo that our evolved jaws are lacking space. But some people never develop wisdom teeth; in fact, these teeth don't appear in about 35 percent of the population [source: Spinney ]. Are we on an evolutionary track to losing them altogether?  Some experts say it's possible these teeth will eventually disappear [sources: Flam , Usbourne ]. Still, there are a few unknowns in the equation. Scientists aren't sure of the role that DNA plays in creating teeth at the third molar position [source: Colf ]. Third molars develop entirely after birth, the only teeth to do so. Because these teeth aren't present at birth, it may be harder for nature to select against them [source: LePage ]. For wisdom teeth to form, the tissue that starts the process of tooth building has to migrate back in the mouth to interact with the back jaw tissue. If this migration doesn't happen, then no tooth will grow there.            ­  There may also be some environmental factors at work, including disease or head trauma, that stop the tissue migration [source: Silvestri, Singh ]. It could also come down to differences in how various cultures use their jaws. For example, in the 1970s, researchers tied the larger jaw that was present in Eskimo women to their tradition of chewing leather to soften it. In parts of East Asia, it's more common to find people with fewer wisdom teeth, if any [source: Vines ]. If people of a culture have reached the point where they don't use a trait, they may lose it.  But some scientists are beginning work on stopping the teeth from appearing altogether, so that we might bioengineer these teeth out of existence before evolution does it for us. Because there's a window of time in which there's no third molar, it might be possible to administer a laser or a chemical agent that would prevent the tooth growth. Preliminary studies have shown some success in dogs and rats [source: Silvestri, Singh ].  Currently, the lack of wisdom teeth doesn't produce any great evolutionary advantage, particularly with the abundance of oral surgeons who can remove the wisdom teeth that do emerge. That makes it hard to say exactly how the trait might adapt in the future. Certainly, oral surgeons probably have their fingers crossed that these teeth continue to appear for a good long while. The rest of us will have to make do with lots of ice cream and the continuous exchange of surgery stories. Sure, those wisdom tooth lackers may claim they're more highly evolved because they don't have to go through a few days of misery, but what do they talk about at boring parties?   Should They Stay or Should They Go?  Wisdom tooth extraction is expensive, and recovering from the surgery is no easy feat, considering that pain, bleeding, swelling, infection and nerve injury are but a few of the complications. Still, removing wisdom teeth is recommended by many dentists to avoid the pain and periodontal disease that results from an impacted tooth. The surgery should be done during young adulthood, before the teeth attach to the jaw and become too difficult to extract.  ­  In 2007, however, dentist Jay W. Friedman claimed in the American Journal of Public Health that at least two-thirds of wisdom tooth extractions are unnecessary [source: Friedman]. He and some other dentists argue that these teeth will come in at the proper position and cause no trouble. These dentists say that instead of simply doing preventative removals for most young people, we should only remove wisdom teeth that are impacted. Other dentists say that these teeth are still difficult to clean and should be removed.              1  2  3  4  NEXT       Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint      Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint                     More to Explore          Related Content          " "       Why are some animals harder to clone than others?
