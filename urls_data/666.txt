The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown. Also, make sure to check out our Freshlook Contact Lenses , which are the most popular, and most widely recommended colored contact lens available.

Terms & Conditions â Contact Lens Sales Please read the following Terms & Conditions carefully before submitting your order. YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE WITH ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: You must have a valid, current prescription for any contact lenses or prescription eyewear that you are ordering issued by a duly licensed eye-care professional located in the USA. You have not been advised by an eye care professional to stop or suspend wearing contact lenses for any medical reason. You will continue to have your eyes examined regularly by a licensed eye care professional. You will restrict your contact lens wearing schedule to the recommended wearing schedule established by your eye-care professional, and you will not exceed this recommended wearing schedule as this can lead to serious eye-health complications. You understand that you must take proper care of your contact lenses as directed by your eye care professional. Before using your contact lenses, you agree to carefully review all instructions and information provided by your eye care professional and/or by the contact lens manufacturer. You should never share your contact lenses with anyone. Contact lenses are classified as prescription medical devices by the FDA.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word âsinisterâ even derives from âleft or left-hand.â  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggioâboth right-handersâare the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  âThe more social the animalâwhere cooperation is highly valuedâthe more the general population will trend toward one side,â says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  âThe most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.â  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a groupâhumans, parrots, baseball players, golfersâbased on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handednessâfor sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennisâmore than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  âThe accuracy of our modelâs predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,â Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, donât always share the same handedness.  âAs computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,â Abrams says.  âBy discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.â  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd thanÂ a blonde or brunette. They are few and farÂ between;Â about one to two percent of the population possessesÂ natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart -Â genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads,"Â the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin â a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytesÂ is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rareÂ because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and requireÂ more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutationÂ causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors.Â Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature gotÂ down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise RedheadsÂ are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are someÂ normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

New York Times' First (and Feminist) Female Reporter                 Left-handed Prince William to wed right-hander.  (WPA Pool/Getty Images)      I'm left-handed. So is Prince William. As a young girl with tween dreams of becoming Kate Middleton with an American accent, I thought it was a special bond between us. And statistically speaking, it is a rather uncommon commonality .  Only 10 percent of the human species is left-handed. Moreover, the New York Times recently reported that the size of the southpaw population has held constant ever since hunter-gatherer days (ancient handedness data come from studies of cave paintings and spears). This relative rarity of being left-handed has mystified scientists and led to a series of specious assumptions about us southpaws, such as linkages to schizophrenia, criminality and dyslexia. At the same time, reports on left-handedness also mention that a majority of recent U.S. presidents -- including Obama -- are left-handed.        However, as I read that NYT article sprinkled with names of notable male lefties, I kept wondering about the whereabouts of my fellow southpaw ladies. Left-handedness runs in families and is influenced by brain symmetry, but does gender have anything to do with it? Anecdotally, I've met more left-handed guys than girls (when you're left-handed, it can be kind of a big deal to shake left hands with a comrade) and I have a left-handed brother.  Turns out, left-handed females are a much rarer breed than left-handed males. A meta analysis of 144 studies including more than 1.7 million total participants found a "significant and robust" gender correlation with handedness. According to the 2008 study, men have 1.23 times the odds of being left-handed, compared to women's chances. Therefore, that would make the odds of being left-handed lady who marries a left-handed prince on the other side of the Atlantic pretty much mathematically impossible.

It has been estimated that only 2% of the worldâs population have true green eyes. To give you an idea of just how special green eyes are, consider this factoid. Currently, it is estimated that around 7 billion people live on the planet. Going by the math, this means only 140 million people have some shade of green as an eye color. There are only a handful of celebrities who have green eyes and even a smaller number who are male. If you are one of these people â consider yourself lucky.    FYI: green eyes can express in several shades, including hazel, emerald, jade and blue-green. In super rare cases, they can even appear amber. When you take into account the different variations of this color, including some people with hues of brown, the number of peopleÂ who can be classified as having green eyes jumps from 2% to 8%. MOST ATTRACTIVE EYE COLOR Guy Counseling recently asked nearly 90,000 website visitors which eye color they considered most attractive (as of 7/4/17). Here are the responses, broken down for each by percentages. Green: 42.8 % Light blue: 22.59 % Hazel: 17.33 Dark Blue: 10.2 Grey: 2% Amber 1% Amethyst: 2% Brown 5% Keep in mind that we are collecting new data from a poll appearing on the bottom of this page.

We will examine how you got your eye color, assess how eye color can be changed and identify a number of famous male celebrities with green eyes. We will also check out some green eyed myths! Other information about various shades of green eye color will be touched upon, including popular hues. Are you ready? Letâs jump right in! What is the science of Green Eyes? Male Green Eyes WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF GREEN EYES? Many people want to know where green eyes come from. Ultimately, eye color is a function of genetics and is determined by two factors: (1) the pigmentation of the iris and (2) the way light scatters around the iris itself. Letâs take a quick look at both. Pigmentation of a personâs iris can run the gamut from the darkest color, black to lightest, blue. Largely influencing pigmentation is something called melanin , a complex polymer made from the amino acid tyrosine. The appearance of green and shades of green (i.e. jade, hazelÂ eyes and emerald) are the result of a Â phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering; which is a 25 cent term used to describe the way light scatters after riding its spectrum wavelength. Most people mistakenly believe that colors like green and blue are in the iris â but theyâre not. Your eye color is a function of how light diffuses across the melanin base, which again is genetically determined. Credit: Wiki Commons GREEN EYES: ORIGINS AND GENES Old theory Prior to 2008, scientists thought eye color was determined by one dominant gene. It was postulated that an eye color hierarchy existed with brown being at the top of the ladder and blue resting at the bottom. Under the old way of thinking, this meant if your dad had brown eyes and your mom had blue eyes, you would likely be born with brown colored eyes. A parental combination of two green eyes would translate into you having green eyes. Recessive genes were also thought to partially influence eye color. New theory New research, presented in a 2008 publication of the American Journal of Human Genetics washed the old way of thinking about eyes and color. The new research suggests that as many as 16 genes may influence the way color is expressed in the iris. The unscientific translation means that a baby can be born with just about any eye color, regardless of what their parents have. It is important to note, however, that hereditary variables need to be factored into the equation. The video below offers an excellent scientific analysis of how people get different color eyes, including green, blue, brown, hazel and some rare variations. GENETIC PREVALENCE OF GREEN EYES Interestingly enough, there are anthropological records of early humans with green eyes living around the mountain system in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This area contained aÂ natural land bridge between Europe and Asia. Knowns as the âSilk Routeâ or âSilk Roadsâ; this ancient passageway was used by early civilizations for the lucrative trade silk, sometimes between 120 BCE â 1450s CE (Yao, et all, 2000). The silk route is thought to be a major reason for the distribution of green eyes WHERE DO GREEN EYES COME FROM? We know from history that Silk Road played an important role in the creation of the civilizations of China, the Goguryeo kingdom in Korea, much of Japan, the Indian subcontinent, parts of Persia and the Horn of Africa and Arabia. Because it served as a significant trade route for many early traders, it is thought that mating between various groups may have been part of gene distribution. This may help to explain why green eyes can be found in various groups across Europe, Africa and Asia. GENETIC ANTHROPOLOGY AND EYE COLOR Genetic anthropology is growing branch of science that examines DNA testing with concrete archaeological, historical and language-based evidence to uncover the history of ancient migration patterns in early human civilizations. Thanks to this emerging area of research, scientists are learning more and more about the etiology of eye color. This is why today, you can have your DNA tested to determine your genetic background. In turn, this may help to explain the genetic reasons for your ocular hue. GREEN EYES AND GEOLOGIC TIME Much of Europe, Asia and Africa and large swaths of the middle east have been native lands to people with green eyes for centuries. When studying the geologic time scale; a tool used to measure our planets history, it is thought that green eyes may have appeared in people of Iranian, Spanish, Brazilian and Pakistani decent sometime during the late part of the Cenozoic period . Specifically, this would be between theÂ Pleistocene and Holocene epochs some 2 to 3 million years ago.  Any race, including people who are Caucasian, Asian, African, Native Indian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic and pre-Colombians (Indigenous Peoples of the Americas) canÂ have green colored eyes. Anthropologists believe eye color, like hazel, blue, brown and green,Â are the direct result of migratory behaviors. Because of inter-mixing of groups, coupled with thousands of genetic mutations, we see various shades of green throughout modern man. Jessee Metcalfe has green eyes.

Many people are curious if eye color can change. The answer is â absolutely! People with green, blue or brown eyes all experience change in color from time to time. Causes for eye color changes include: The way light scatters Mood Health/Medical reasons HOW EYE COLOR CAN CHANGE DUE TO HEALTH The color of your iris can permanently change if you have glaucoma and take certain medications for treatment. If you have light colored eyes and want to keep them, you need to be extremely careful with the glaucoma medications you take. Make sure you consult with your eye doctor to discover all of the facts. Other reasons eye color can change to certain types of diseases. Examples include Hornerâs syndrome and Fuchâs heterochromic iridocyclitis. Should you notice any changes in the color of your eyes, contact your doctor immediately. Green eyes of Tom Welling: Credit insoonia.com GREEN EYES AND HEALTH RISKS If you have green eyes, you are more susceptible to the sunâs harmful radiation. This has to do with our old friend melanin previously mentioned. Simply put, green eyed people can develop certain types of ocular cancers, like intraocular melanoma . People with light colored eyes should wear UV protective sunglasses when outdoors. Jensen Ackles has light green eyes: Credit Fanpop PHENOMENON OF RAYLEIGH SCATTERING As mentioned previously, green eyes, blue eyes and brown eyes do not actually have these colors deposited into the iris. In truth, your eye pigmentation has a little brown in them. Because of the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering, your eyes will reflect back a certain colored hue. Green eyes can come in different shades Green eyes with gold specs of Eddie Redmaybe HOW LIGHT CHANGES EYE COLOR Using the prior mentioned scientific principle of Rayleigh scattering, transformation of light particles that land on the iris will impact its coloristic appearance. This can result in a person having hazel, amber, jade, emerald, blue and even gray! Other factors can influence the shade of green in eyes. Lighting: Artificial lighting (aka: light bulbs) can impact how eye color is experienced. The intensity of the light hitting your iris will either amplify or soften your irisâs appearance.  Time of day: Light from the sun may be more intense earlier in the day or later, which means your iris will âpick-upâ different intensities from the solar spectrum .  Reflective colors: The color of everything around you, including the cloths you have on, can intensify how eye color is experienced. Certain colors, like gold, blue and other greens can amplify the flecks reflecting outward from your Iris.  Makeup: Some people wear eye-makeup, like gold and purple eye-shadow, to accentuate the natural green of the iris. This can cause the desired effect of having chameleon eyes.  Gorgeous makeup makes a line of eye shadow specifically designed for people with green eye color. Allergies: Some people with allergies have âscratchy eyesâ which can cause the surrounding âwhitesâ of the eyes to become red (aka: bloodshot eyes). This can have the effect of amplifying your eye color and creating baggy eyes.Most people do not desire this look.  Emotional state: While your emotional state does not directly change the color of your eyes, what you are feeling at any given point in time can impact how they are perceived. Specifically, if you are depressed and crying, your pupil may dilate, which may give off a darker appearance.  Substances: Use of alcohol, uppers, downers and other kinds of medications can cause your pupils to become larger or smaller. The end result can mean your eye color becomes more intense. Josh Henderson has a green eye and blue eye because of heterochromia. HETEROCHROMIA Some people have a condition called heterochromia that causes one eye to be one color (like green) and the other eye to be a different color (like blue). While multiple causes have been suggested, the current scientific thinking suggests that a lack of genetic diversity is the main reason for heterochromia. It is thought that the condition is caused by a mutation of the genes determining melanin distribution, which often becomes changed due to chromosomal homogeneity. The photograph above of actor Josh Henderson is an example of someone with heterochromia. Notice one of his eyes are green. The other is blue. Very rare and unique. NOTE OF CAUTION If your eye color changes suddenly or if you notice your pupils remain dilated for no apparent reason for an extended period of time, contact your physician immediately. Your eyes are not something you want to play with. What Do Your Eyes Say About You Video Channing Tatum has a unique pair of green eyes that are almost jade.

John Michael  says:   December 14, 2015 at 12:00 am  Thats interesting because I have blond hair and green eyes being the only one in my family. I am a male and have retained these colours all my life. Would these same Iranians be from the area where the ancient civilisation of Media once stood?

But I wasnât.  Really!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 4, 2015 at 8:30 pm  Same here, i feel like in the wrong place   belaboa9  says:   November 4, 2015 at 11:53 pm  Are you the only one with green eyes too?  At least I can fall back on the fact that Iâm 3/4 Irish!  All the boys in my family have blue eyes, and all the girls have brown or hazel.  I feel like an oddball!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 4:43 pm  Yes, among my large family (grandma, uncles, cousins, etc) I am the only one with green eyes. Well, my bio dad has green eyes, but my mum is a single mother, so I barely know him. But itâs not just about the eye colour, itâs something more, like behaviour, itâs strange o:   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 7:52 pm  Are you the black sheep of the family?  I am.  Iâm considered the âweirdâ one because Iâm the smartest, most creative, adventurous, risk-taking and mystical one.  I follow my own path no matter what anyone else says.  And I have snakes! LOL  And two rescue dogs.   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 10:14 pm  Kinda, well, i do not consider myself that smart, but i tell you that my family doesnât even get jokes from the simpsons ð   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 11:07 pm  Bummer.  So how is your behaviour different from the rest of your familyâs?   Alejandro Ontiveroz  says:   February 10, 2016 at 8:02 pm  I have green eyes too and so does my sister. I guess it is because my dad has vary light blue eyes and my mom has semi dark brown eyes. I only know 3 people with green eyes. But i donât think im very attractive. Im a male and i have girl like features. And i have long hair.   belaboa9  says:   February 11, 2016 at 6:36 pm  Yeah, but how old are you?  Most guys arenât their handsomest until theyâre 35-40 years old!   smokeyjofencing  says:   March 6, 2017 at 6:56 pm  yep that would be me too. But have no dogs, love snakes, never had them as pets though.   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:53 pm  EVERYONE has blue eyes! No other colors at all just Blue! Even Aunts an Cousins sea of blue eyes!   belaboa9  says:   June 24, 2016 at 8:39 pm  Like I said to someone else, it must be a really recessive gene that decided to resurface, unless we are adopted, or our daddies arenât really our daddies!  OMG!   smokeyjofencing  says:   March 6, 2017 at 6:54 pm  I know just how you feel. ð   marley  says:   July 29, 2017 at 2:56 pm  I have pure green light eyes that for some reason sparkle   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 1:48 am  I also am the only green eye person in my family. Both parents, and all siblings have blue eyes. Also, all blood relations on both sides have blue eyes. Not one brown eye, and Iâm the one green eye. Itâs always bothered me!   belaboa9  says:   June 22, 2016 at 2:12 pm  Me, too!  Iâve always wondered how many generations back in my family I would have to go, to find another green-eyed person.  Itâs got to come from the Irish side, or maybe thereâs a little bit of gypsy on the Italian side!  In any case, Iâll never know!   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:52 pm  In Nursing School I was told eye color only comes from parents. Iâve wondered about my paternity every since. I am the odd ball! Not just eye color either. To chicken to ask. Lol My mother said IT WAS THE EVIL COMING OUT IN ME when I mentioned it once! Donât know if that was joke, but I never mentioned it again   belaboa9  says:   June 23, 2016 at 1:22 am  LOL!  I learned the same thing in Nursing School!  Thatâs why I always thought I was adopted.  But I wasnât.  Iâve got my birth certificate, and all my baby pictures are in the family albums!  It must be a really recessive gene which has resurfaced! ????  Lucky for us!   Shannon Mullis-Long  says:   October 6, 2015 at 9:31 am  Myself and three cousins have green eyes. My mother has brown my father blue. Mine are constantly changing from blue green to emerald green to grey. No two days are the same and sometimes changing twice or three times a day.   Luke  says:   October 24, 2015 at 6:08 am  I have green eyes and have been told more than once that my eyes look good.   Fred E Rick  says:   October 31, 2015 at 10:14 pm  I have green eyes. I can see through your soul.   Rinny  says:   January 14, 2017 at 3:44 pm  Me too. I have that piercing through your soul quality. ð   Kimberly Parrish  says:   December 3, 2015 at 6:36 pm  Jense Ackles I could stare into those green eyes all day they are so beautiful.   Anna  says:   December 5, 2015 at 1:31 am  I have green eyes, but the guy that you have as âLatinoâ is actually half black and his name is Damonâ¦   John D. Moore  says:   December 5, 2015 at 1:40 am  You are right! Thanks for letting me know???? Iâll correct   Dinara  says:   December 11, 2015 at 7:35 pm  Interesting article. I have green eyes. Actually one green, the other one is slightly brown. Not so noticeable fortunately ????   Glen  says:   December 12, 2015 at 9:20 pm  I had blue eyes as a child, which was odd at the time as both my mother and father has brown, (I also had blonde hair as a child but now it is dark brown) Iâm 35 now and my eyeâs are now a deep shade of green and have been since a young age, I am the youngest of 4 and the only other person in my immediate family with green eyes is my eldest brother. I wasnât aware green eyes were considered rare.   Tucker  says:   March 21, 2017 at 6:00 pm  I had blue eyes as a young child but they turned to green before my teens.   John Michael  says:   December 13, 2015 at 11:55 pm  I am a male and have blond hair and 1 green lighter eye and 1 green darker eye. I wonder what the percentages for this is? I am also the only one in my family with it and I thought I was adopted. So I did check with the hospital and Iâm legit. Lol. Use to feel a bit freakish because there a so few of us. Now I know Iâm blessed!   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:47 am  I have very light yellow green eyes with blue around the rim. How does that factor into the green eyed equation? I know that it does come from the Italian side og my family, with only one member of each genation having this particular eye coloe.   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:50 am  Oh, and I not only have a very unusual eye color (only one in my family) but am lefy-handed as well (again the only one in my family). I probably would have been burned at the stake in Salem as a witch. Ha!   Pavel Sivi  says:   February 23, 2016 at 9:42 am  all my famly has different kinds of green eyes. but mine are strange they sometimes seem to be blue and sometimes green. depends on the light. but as far as i see they are green   Karen Denning  says:   April 6, 2016 at 4:49 pm  What is it about green eyes that catches peopleâs attention? It makes me feel uneasy when I notice someone staring at my eyes. From my perspective I seem to be hyper sensitive to light compared to most people. I squint a lot which gives others the impression that Iâm mad or something. LOL   Eric Weeber  says:   June 18, 2016 at 4:51 pm  i know the feeling with that one..mine are light to mid green and i have always squinted alot due to light.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:37 pm  I think in my life about 2 people have commented on my eye colour!  But agree about the light although mine are darker than a lot of blue-eyed folk, I think.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5f684a4b7e1174fe4f3923947702156e9b71123bc1fb2577d471e9b9b7a1d0a3.jpg   Rebecca A  says:   December 18, 2016 at 11:29 am  I very light sensitive eyes. It feels natural to wear sunglasses constantly.  I have prescription medications to try to help ease the pain and discomfort   Lillian Carbone  says:   February 12, 2017 at 12:40 pm  I have green eyes and brown hair but my eyes also have a yellow hue to them and I have a small brown speck in one of my eyes ,Iâve been told that I have Lizzieâs eyes lol   kira  says:   April 16, 2017 at 1:51 pm  thats called hazel   marley  says:   July 29, 2017 at 3:00 pm  OMG the same thing myne is right above green (but insted of brown its yellow ) same as my mom   Anne Lunar  says:   April 14, 2016 at 6:50 pm  This definitely makes us non-green eyed people feel not so special haha   Carla  says:   May 22, 2016 at 12:53 pm  What makes green eyes âbeautifulâ is their rareness not their colour! Every eye has itâs own and special shade that makes them beautiful in its way! Yours sure are too! ð   Nicole Lovelace  says:   September 1, 2016 at 9:25 pm  Thatâs not true, green is a beautiful color. Even if they werenât rare, they would still be a popular eye color.   Carla  says:   September 6, 2016 at 6:42 pm  Indeed, but Iâm not talking about preference but about rareness. Think about itâ¦ If 90% of the population had green eyes and only 10% had, for example, brown eyes, which color would be more desiredâ¦ green or brown? I honestly think that itâs more a matter of exclusiveness than color. And please donât think that Iâm saying this beacause I donât love my eye color or something. I actually do have green eyes, I just donât like when people compare themselves with others, just because they donât have what those people do have and donât feel special because of it. If that even makes senseâ¦ :S xD (Sorry if Iâm a little off with my writing skills, not my mother tongue xD, And sorry too for that unnecessary large reply xD)   Michele Kasel  says:   April 29, 2016 at 11:13 pm  i have green eyes and if i wear violet-blue contact lenses they look cool!   i also have brown contactsâi guess i get sorta bored with the same color eyes for 50 years LOL   Gabbyy Fratt  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:33 pm  I have green eyes but if u look close they have a little bit of light brown in the middle then blue all around the rest but farther away they r bright green itâs rlly weird   Carla  says:   May 22, 2016 at 12:50 pm  This only means that you have some shade of hazel eyes. Half brown, half green, and sometimes some blue too!   hunter  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:36 pm  i have green eyes and my parent have them to and my brother and sister and all my other family members have them to   Ann  says:   July 26, 2016 at 6:26 pm  Same with me, except I donât know about extended family.   Tyler Karl Lia  says:   May 18, 2016 at 3:03 am  Would have like the article, but the mixed race bastards who have my eyes ruined it.   Frank E Richardson  says:   May 19, 2016 at 5:09 pm  I got my green eyrs from my father, and they ate popular on that dide of my family, i thought it was an Irish trait   Frank E Richardson  says:   May 19, 2016 at 5:11 pm  I got my green eyes from my father and they are popular on that side of my family, i thought it was an Irish trait   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:58 pm  Very rare eye color always new that, but was surprised how rare!  Pretty sure in the case of eyes it only Parents not like Hair color or skin! Not sure why!   Deborah Wilbourn  says:   May 24, 2016 at 12:07 am  Iâm the middle child of 5 children both father and mother have brown eyes older brother blue eyes older sister younger sister and younger brother all have brown eyes. As far back as I can trace  in family history mostly blue eyes and brown eyes going back to my great grandparents none with green eyes can be found.  I do have one daughter with green eyes the other with blue, their dad has blue eyes. This article I read has a lot of information that is true for me and the trait of having green eyes, however I do believe there is much more information missing due to my age and experience.   Stephanie  says:   May 28, 2016 at 5:35 pm  There goes my Mendel Pundit square argument Big B little b times Big B little b gets 2 Brown eyes BB 50!per cent blue eyes Little b little b All that is down the tubes   Stephanie  says:   May 28, 2016 at 5:37 pm  My father brown eyes My mother blue 2 dark eyed sister 2 blue eyed( Iâm considered blue but Iâm green)   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:56 pm  As long as you have a brown eyed parent they whole all eye color genes. A brown eye parent can have any eye color child from how I understood it in school   Denis St  says:   June 14, 2016 at 5:23 pm  What should I sayâ¦ My eyes turned from light blue to grassy/olive green in 8-9th grade, one of my eye corner has a little part of light blue, but hardly noticeable (unless you pay close attention) my hair from ginger turned to the darkest brown/black then it turned into almost dirty blonde color..   Beth  says:   June 16, 2016 at 2:33 am  Eye color doesnât run the âgambit,â people. It runs the âgamut.â A gamut is a scale; a gambit is a chess move, or other scheme.

GeneJacket  says:   August 7, 2016 at 2:27 am  god as soon as i saw the pol my self esteem just went down 100% â brown eyed girl   MarÃ­a Paz Greene F  says:   April 26, 2017 at 12:49 am  Awww, brown eyes are LOVELY! The hottest guy I ever met had this brown eyes that make me felt like a whole hidden universe was beneath them.. that he wouldnât show. So use your brownies and do the same with cute guys! But be nice. Donât underestimate the power. Donât be mean as this guy ALMOST did <3   GC  says:   August 15, 2016 at 7:26 pm  I am 100% Mexican and have green eyes that can look bright blue when I wear blue or in all white environments.  I was told I was born with sky blue eyes but they changed color when I was 8-9 month old to green.  All the members of my bio father have green eyes and his father as well.  All my motherâs have brown except for her great grandmma who had blue.  Im older now and notice my eye color is changing to more blue than green, I donât like that!  And never knew they were rare??  I went to grammar school in small town in central Mexico.  Out of a class of about 25, 6 kids had green eyes, WTH??  And I never knew why I was sensitiv to bright light and I hate the sun!!  I was freaked to learn in the poll, I am Latino, a Scorpio and other traits I can relate to LoL!  Thx   BTDTGTTS  says:   August 16, 2016 at 3:29 pm  My husband has one blue and one green eye.  I have pale grey blue eyes.  My son has brilliant blue eyes with a dark ring around them and a few yellow specks.  My daughter has soft green eyes with a dark ring and yellow specks.  I love all their eye colors and just wish mine werenât so wishy washy grey blue.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:38 pm  grey-blue is a great eye colour!   David  says:   August 17, 2016 at 9:18 am  I have green eyes which are very sensitive to light or even a breeze (especially a winter one). I used to get compliments about my eyes when I was younger but not so much now. ð I like the fact that they are a rare trait.   Gulfidan  says:   September 8, 2016 at 5:25 pm  Well I do have very different green eye color most people they donât believe it is my regular color????

I have never seen that many GREEN eyed people in one place it was AWESOME   Americkan  says:   October 23, 2016 at 3:36 pm  I have very green eyes and very fair skin,when I was born and until about four my hair was white,then went to blond,then light brown. At the ripe age of 35 my hair went from light brown right back to white/silver. My eye color however remained green. My parents and 4siblings do not have green eyes, only me. Until recently I never gave my eye color much thought but now I think Iâm just a little unique.

Contact Author   What causes people to have green eyes? Green eyes are especially rare. In humans, the pigmentation of an iris can range from very light amber yellow to a very dark brown, bordering on black. The darkness of the iris depends on its concentration of melanin. The amount of melanin in your eyes or skin determines it's color. The greater the concentration of melanin, the darker the eye color. Green eyes possess low to moderate amounts of melanin. However, green is actually not a pigmentation of the iris at all.  The main role of skin pigmentation seems to be to absorb ultraviolet radiation and this is true about the iris of the eyes too.  Rayleigh scattering is the dispersion of light off of air molecules, this helps determine eye color. This same scattering of light occurs in the sky which makes it appear blue, orange, pink, etc. and mountains in the distance appear purple or blue. In the eye, this effect occurs in the top layer (stroma) of the iris. The blue optical effect of the Rayleigh scattering combined with the light to medium melanin pigmentation combines to make the eye appear green.       Origins of Green Eyes   Light Melanin Pigmentation In Green Eyes Light melanin pigmentation mixes with the blue caused by Rayleigh scattering to appear green.   Genetics, Prevelance and Distribution of Green Eyes Only 2% of the world's population has green eyes or about 140 million people. Why do so few people have this trait? The answer boils down to genetics.  Until 2007, it was believed that there was a hierarchy of eye color. Brown was dominant over green, which was dominant over blue. You received two genes for an eye color, one gene from each parent, and whichever was the dominant gene would express itself. Therefore two brown genes would obviously express itself as brown. A brown gene and a blue or green gene would express itself as brown. A green gene and a blue gene would express itself as green. And only a combination of two blue genes would express itself as blue.  The study disproving this Mendelian theory for eye color was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics , and was supported with grants from Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council and the United States of America's National Cancer Institute.  Now it is proven that eye color is controlled by more than one gene; there have been 16 genes that contribute to eye color. This means that there is a chance that a person can inherit virtually any eye color, no matter the eye color of the parents (although the chances for people of certain heritages having a particular eye color are different than for others).  Africa, Asia, Europe, the middle east and the America's have been home to those with green eyes for thousands of years. Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Russia, Spain, and Brazil all have had populations with green eyes for a long time. All races, including Caucasian, African, Asian, Pacific Islanders, Arabic, Hispanic and the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas can also have green eyes. Green eyes most likely developed because of the migration of people over time, those from northern latitudes with light coloring traveled south and people of dark coloring traveling north intermixed, leading to a variation of melanin produced. Today the green eyes of their descendents can be found on every continent.  Notably, there have been records of people with green eyes originating around the Caucasus mountains, which links Europe and Asia. Several passes through the mountain range made it a strategic region or military and trade(silk road).  There is a village in north western China called Liqian in which two-thirds of the inhabitants have green eyes and blonde hair. DNA has linked these people to an ancestor(s) that was caucasian. Some believe that they are descendents of the legendary missing army of Marcus Crassus, a Roman general that disappeared in 36 bc. However Liqian is along the silk road trade route so many people passed through. Until more proof is found, no one is sure if Marcus Crassus and his army were ever in Liqian.  Is it possible there will be more green eyed people in the future due to mass migration and globalization? For now only time will tell.       Chameleon Eyes or Rayleigh Scattering Some people believe green eyes are magical.   Factors That Can Slightly Alter Green Eye Color Because of this, changes in the light being scattered by the iris of lighter colored eyes will change the apparent color of the eyes. This results in "chameleon eyes", or eyes that change color. They fall into the amber, hazel, green, grey, and blue range. Specific factors that can cause the eyes to appear to change colors are:  Mood: Mood plays a role in the color of your eyes. Or rather the optical illusion of eye color.  If you have bloodshot eyes, you may notice your eyes are bright green, this is because of the contrast red/pink is the opposite of green.  Pupil dilation is also a factor and your pupils change size depending on the emotions you feel.  Happiness and also anger cause your pupils to dilate, thus increasing the amount of light let in.  This increases the rayleigh scattering and your eyes may appear more green.  Smaller pupils let less light in, making them appear more grey. This is also a signal you are sad or not feeling well.  Weather: The weather can change the ambient light. There is a big difference between the spectrum of colors in the light cast by a cloudy day, a sunny day, a moonlit night, and a sunset.  Temperature: Temperature can seem correlated to eye color, but this is because the temperature may vary in various lighting situationsâfor example, the lighting in your office when it's cold and cloudy and the windows are drawn vs the lighting in your office when it is sunny and the windows are open.  Colors you are wearing: Wearing certain colors such as blue, yellow, or green will provide more of that color for your eyes to scatter, enhancing that color. Green and gold eyeshadows act similarly. On the flip side, other eyeshadows that make green eyes stand out more are colors in the purple family (plum, lavender, lilac), coppers, and apricot because they contrast with the green, making it stand out even more.  Colors around you: The colors in close proximity to you will act similarly to the colors you are wearing.  Lighting: Artificial lighting can vary to an even greater degree than natural lighting, and the varying spectrums of light will impact your apparent eye color  Again, drastic eye color changes, especially in adults, could be a sign of an eye problem. If they occur, please see your eye doctor.       Heterochromia Source   Medical Reasons for Eye Color Change A color change in the iris can be caused by factors such as radiation, disease, and chemicals. For example, glaucoma medications report a side effect of permanently changing lighter colored eyes to brown. Glaucoma medication was discovered to also have the side effect of lengthening eyelashes and is marketed as an eyelash lengthener. These products are FDA approved under the supervision of a doctor.  Heterochromia is when one of the eyes is a different color from the other one. It can be genetic, from an injury or illness.  If, as an adult, one or both of your eyes changes colors drastically, see a doctor. It could be a symptom of diseases such as Fuchâs heterochromic iridocyclitis, Hornerâs syndrome, or pigmentary glaucoma or something else.  Other health risks for people with lighter colored eyes can come from radiation. Melanin in the iris helps protect eyes from UV sunlight. People with lighter colored eyes, including green, are more at risk for sun-related eye problems including melanoma of the uvea, a type of cancer. People with lighter colored eyes should wear UV-protective sunglasses while outside for extended periods of time.   Personality associations with green eyes A relatively small amount of people have green eyes, it is no wonder that some interesting associations have flourished around the eye color.  These are not proven facts.  Here is a list of some of the perceptions surrounding them:  Green eyes are said to be magical.  People with green eyes tend to have long lasting relationships.  People with green eyes are the most passionate.  Green-eyed people are jealous, as in the saying "green with envy".  Green-eyed people may be more prone to have liver or other digestive problems.  They are a powerful aphrodisiac.  People with green eyes are very inventive.  People with green eyes act spontaneously  People with green eyes are perceived as less trustworthy than blue or brown eyes.  Green eyed people can be more provacative.  Green eyed people are strange!        Eyeshadow on Green Eye Source   Cosmetic Eye Surgery While illegal in the United States, elsewhere in the world iris implants are available with surgery, resulting in light grey eyes. This procedure can sometimes be reversed.  While very few companies offer permanent eye color change for cosmetic reasons, researchers are studying ways to change eye color permanently without the use of implants.   Magical, Mysterious Green Eyes Source   Trivia Bit Here is a bit of interesting trivia, take it with a grain of salt. The International Community for Alien Research conducted a study of potential alien contactees and found that green eyed people were the largest group to report contact!  "Green/Hazel eyes make up 48% of the 1400 contactees that took part in this study and make up 70% of the O Neg. group. Blue eyes making up 36% of the blood types and 23% of the O Neg. group. Brown eyes make up 16% of the study group and 7% of the O Neg. group."       What Color Eyes (natural) Do you have?  Green  Blue  Brown  Hazel  Violet  Red  Grey  Amber  Other See results   About the poll I expect that the majority of the votes in the poll will be "green eyes" because many people that read this article will be curious about their own eye color, thus it will be biased.

Iâve been wondering why me,my dad, and my brother have green eyes and no one else does. My brother has like a yellow Brown in the center of his green eye. My eyes are dark green. And my dadâs are a little lighter than mine. My dads mom is full German and his dad is Scottish-American  hellen 3 weeks ago  all of my family has green eyes  RGP 4 weeks ago  I have bright green eyes, my dad has grey eyes, my mom(rip) had green eyes but on both sides blue eyes are rather dominant. I'm Dutch( for over 7centuries) but also German bloodline.  Sharon 4 weeks ago  Love reading this information  Olivia 5 weeks ago  I'm from Australia and both my parents have brown eyes and dark hair but i have green eyes and blonde hair.  James Arthur Mullins 5 weeks ago  I'm in Kiev, Ukraine, seeking romance. Amazed at the high percentage of green eyed women.  Glitter 5 weeks ago  Ya the same here a D I'm rh also an I'd have to say same things with me an my life weird not to me but what people are told to be an that's not I guess. Is why I say cause it's weird to most people I'm gifted as Claireaudient I felt I'd come across the same when I searched Glad that someone else I'd thinking I do explore the cosmos out of body it's better than most scientists lol  R N 5 weeks ago  Not sure what color mine are. Hazel, then green, and then grey. Probably hazel.  K in Bama 6 weeks ago  I have bright green eyes. My husband has seas blue eyes with large very bright yellow stars in the middle. Both his parents have ice blue eyes. His older sister has brown eyes with blue rings on the outside. His dad accepted this as possible, but rejected him as a baby because of his weird star eyes. He knows that his sister is not hos dad's, she has the same eyes as her real dad's. He looks just like his dad's family, but his dad still rejects him due to the odd eyes. Because of this, his mom also rejected and blamed him, and gave him away as a child. For this reason he hates his beautiful eyes. We did a hereditary search, along with a DNA test. He is descended from Scotch Lords, English Lords, an ancient line of masculine German Kings, Scandinavians, Greeks, and is over 2% Egyptian. It seems his direct male line existed in Scotland before the Scots. They then became Scots, and then English, before his ancestor went to America. He's heard stories that the weird eyes may have came from Egyptians who migrated. He doesn't know for certain. I just find it so odd that having the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen could cause him so many problems in his child hood. To this day neither of his parents want anything to do with him. Our children were all born with blue eyes, but one turned green later. They are as follows: ice blue with ice blue stars; green with green stars; and ice blue with no stars. They have basically no relationship with his family. I wish that more people would read articles like yours and educate themselves so that children wouldn't have to go through foolishness like that in this day and age.

We are American Mutts. Our heritage is all over the place which extends all the way back to Plymouth Rock as well as New Amsterdam. Mother had ocean blue eyes and my father had dark brown eyes. Mine are green and they change color from sage green to bluish-green. The posterior leaf is green but I have a little bit of gold heterochromia on the anterior leaf of both eyes but it only extends from say 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock and radiates out as the light hits. Also I have a heavy limbal ring around my pupils. It used to be black but as I have aged it has become a dark grey with a blue tint. I also have Wolfflin nodules that are light green which I was told by the optometrist is highly rare. He said they are usually white or yellow. My right eye also has a few transparent gold "freckles" which are absent from the left eye. My eyes also glow with an iridescence that my mother said "looked evil".

They were so beautiful.  someone 9 months ago  my mum has blue eyes and my dad has brown...yet somehow i have green eyes.  PS 9 months ago  I was in St. Petersburg Russia on vacation and noticed how many women had stunning green eyes and light even tanned skin.  Beautiful.

There is full heterochromia which you have listed here in your hub, it is where the eyes are each 2 different colors, then there is sectoral heterochromia which is a section or multiple sections in one or both of the eyes that is a different color than the rest of the iris. Then there is central heterochromia, which I personally have, it is were your iris is one color (blue, green, brown, amber, etc) and then there is a completely different color center ring, mine is chartreuse green inner circle and sky blue/grey outer iris with a dark blue limbal ring.  Each of these heterochromia eyes can be any combo as long as its different colors.  Amber 9 months ago  Both of my parents have brown eyes and mine are green....

Ace 11 months ago  Green Eyes and O- blood type here.  anybody else have that?  Silveria 11 months ago  All my life I have wondered why the majority of my family was born with either blue or green eyes, though we are of Mexican descent.  After a recent DNA test, I was pleasantly shocked to find out we were 70% European, with the remaining Latino, Native American and African descent.  I myself have green eyes, unlike my father who was born blond and blue-eyed.  With these traits in mind, I am reminded my DNA test also informed me I am 10% Irish!

There's not even a hint of green in them, only bright gold striations and light grey back-grounding and pupilary dilation. My mother told me long ago that I've had that condition since early childhood when I first displayed my "Irish Temper" inherited from my father who is 1st generation Irish from both his parents.

My twin brother has hazel eyes being mostly greenish. I have green eyes. My eyes are pretty sensitive to light, but when I am in the sun, my friends ooh and aww over my eye color. They say that they "pop" or "glow" green. I really enjoy having green eyes, but it also bothers me that they are not completely green... my right eye is darker than the left; it has dark green, a slight lining of brownish green, specks (more like streaks) of grey, and more shades of green. My left eye is cool. It is lighter like I said, and it has light green mixed with bright grey, and only one tiny speck of brown at the bottom. The right half of that eye is a shade darker than the other halfâ¦ it is almost completely dark green, while the other half is a bright grey- greenâ¦ If the sun hits my eyes at the right angle, and if I am happy (emotion can change the eye dilation then changing the density of the melanin) then you can see the slightest bit of blue. Why are my eyes this way? I have brunette hair with a slight tinge of red. What exactly does this have to do with genetics?... I mean, is incomplete dominance or codominance with eye color traits playing a role here?  salah 14 months ago  my father has green eyes and my mom has brown,now me and my 2 sisters has green eyes and my brother has brown  CanadaGirl 14 months ago  It funny. My dad has green,greysh eyes, my mom as brown eyes. I have green. Like others I have had blue eyes when I was a baby. My mom is Italian, German, Lebanese and Portuguese-Portugal.  My dad is 100 percent Italian and I have tan skin and brown hair.  Evelyn 14 months ago  I only read this article because I find green eyes quite interesting and I was planning to make the main character of my book have green eyes as well. I have brown eyes though but they're so dark people say they're black and its a fact that its impossible to have black eyes. (BTW I changed my mind about making my main character have brown eyes, I'm gonna make them violet.)  Meriale 14 months ago  This is quite interesting. But there are some facts left out of the article... for instance... most all green eyed people are highly intelligent. Most all Green eyed people do have colour changes depending on their moods... such as my eyes can go from a deep emerald green with amber flecks to a more olive green with yellow and brown flecks.  My husband's eyes changed from a pale light green to a baby blue. Go figure.  I have 10 brothers and sisters and out of 10 only 2 of us have green eyes... my mother had emerald green eyes and my dad had a brilliant blue. 4 of my siblings have the brilliant blue like my father and the other 4 have brown.  I had 2 children and both have a cerulean blue with a dark blue ring around the iris. My grandfather on my mother's side had those eyes.  Out of my 3 grandchildren, 2 have light blue and 1 has eyes like a prism. His iris's are made up of every colour there is... flecks of Dark blue, light blue, green, grey, brown and amber with a dark blue ring. I've never seen eyes like his in all my life.  They're just beautiful.  I used to wish I had blue eyes like my father and siblings... but now I'm proud to have green eyes. I think all eye colours are beautiful, though. Everyone is unique in their own way.  Luis 15 months ago  Both of my parents have brown eye and so do all of my family (they Mexican) but for some reason they're dark and so are my sibling I'm the oldest, and for some reason I look white ( I also have green eyes) but nobody in my family that I know of have green eyes! I've asked if I was like adopted but I'm not and I just find it weird how Mexicans are so diversed because also one of my moms sisters looks black and so do her kids, and my moms brother well he looks a little Asian but they all have the same father, but in my case my family is very dark but for me I don't look very related to them because again I look white, born with blue but now green eyes, dark brown hair, and I they only other person in my family with colored eyes is my sister which hers are hazel. But I consider myself lucky. I always get complaints from strangers about my eyes  Ashley Calloway 15 months ago  Team Green  Nell Rose 15 months ago  from England How interesting! I have blue eyes, and recently wrote about blue eyes and where they came from. would love green eyes though!  wow 15 months ago  wow, that's amazing, you guys. My eyes don't change color. it is always brown.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown. Also, make sure to check out our Freshlook Contact Lenses , which are the most popular, and most widely recommended colored contact lens available.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word âsinisterâ even derives from âleft or left-hand.â  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggioâboth right-handersâare the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  âThe more social the animalâwhere cooperation is highly valuedâthe more the general population will trend toward one side,â says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  âThe most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.â  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a groupâhumans, parrots, baseball players, golfersâbased on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handednessâfor sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennisâmore than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  âThe accuracy of our modelâs predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,â Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, donât always share the same handedness.  âAs computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,â Abrams says.  âBy discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.â  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

Photo courtesy of Pexels, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail We can more easily spot a redhead in a crowd thanÂ a blonde or brunette. They are few and farÂ between;Â about one to two percent of the population possessesÂ natural red locks. However, their hair isn't the only thing that sets them apart -Â genetic differences can affect everything from their pain threshold to how easily they bruise. In the Reactions video , "The Chemistry of Redheads,"Â the American Chemical Society explains redheads get their hair color and pale skin due to a genetic variant that causes their cells to produce reddish pheomelanin â a type of melanin. Redheads have a particularly high abundance of pheomelanin, with very little eumelanin, which ranges from brown to black. On the surface of melanocytesÂ is a protein known as melanocortin 1 receptor, or MC1R. When it's activated, it causes melanocytes to specifically produce eumelanin over phenomelanin, which balances out an individual's ratio. Read More: 5 Secrets Your Hair Is Trying To Tell You About Your Health Contrastingly, redheads are born with a genetic variant that causes MC1R to chemically function differently on melanocytes, which leads to less eumelanin and more pheomelanin production. These genetic variants are recessive, meaning in order to be born a redhead, either non-redhead parents are carriers (25 percent), or one parent is a redhead and the other is a carrier (50 percent); or both parents are redheads (almost 100 percent). This makes redheads rare and unique both on the outside and inside. Take a look at other facts about redheads that you probably didn't know. Red Hair And Blue Eyes Is Rare The combination of having both red hair and blue eyes is so rareÂ because blue eye color is also a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have it. Red hair occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population, while just 17 percent of the world's population has blue eyes. The majority of redheads have brown, hazel, or green eyes. Require More Anesthetic Redheads may be harder to sedate than blondes or brunettes, and requireÂ more anesthesia during surgery. In a 2004 study , redhead patients required 20 to 30 percent more anesthetic than other women to reach the same level of sedation. The same experiment was also replicated with mice, which found animals with a MC1R mutation also required more sedation. Researchers suspect because the gene belongs to the family group of genes that play a role in pain, the mutationÂ causes redheads to be more sensitive to it. The genetic mutation could affect the activity of endorphins, known as the body's natural painkillers, which may lead to an increase in pain. Sensitive To Cold And Hot Sensations Gingers are more likely to be sensitive to cold and hot sensations than people with different hair colors.Â Researchers at Louisville University in Kentucky found they needed extra doses of anesthetic during surgery, and were susceptible to pain at around 43 degrees Fahrenheit, unlike those with dark hair who didn't begin to flunch until the temperature gotÂ down to freezing. It's believed MC1R may cause the temperature-detecting gene to become over-activated, making redheads more cold. More Likely To Bruise RedheadsÂ are also more likely to bruise. They have normal blood counts and coagulate blood like others, yet a 2006 study found they bruise more easily. Researchers suspect people who always bruise excessively may assume this is normal, because they've experienced it often. However, people who bruise only rarely may become concerned about a single bruise linked with minor trauma. There are someÂ normal, healthy people who consider their bleeding and bruising to be excessive .

Similar to having red hair, left-handedness is a recessive trait , with an estimated 10 to 12 percent of people being lefties . Recessive traits tend to come in pairs, which suggests why a lot of redheads are also left-handed.

New York Times' First (and Feminist) Female Reporter                 Left-handed Prince William to wed right-hander.  (WPA Pool/Getty Images)      I'm left-handed. So is Prince William. As a young girl with tween dreams of becoming Kate Middleton with an American accent, I thought it was a special bond between us. And statistically speaking, it is a rather uncommon commonality .  Only 10 percent of the human species is left-handed. Moreover, the New York Times recently reported that the size of the southpaw population has held constant ever since hunter-gatherer days (ancient handedness data come from studies of cave paintings and spears). This relative rarity of being left-handed has mystified scientists and led to a series of specious assumptions about us southpaws, such as linkages to schizophrenia, criminality and dyslexia. At the same time, reports on left-handedness also mention that a majority of recent U.S. presidents -- including Obama -- are left-handed.        However, as I read that NYT article sprinkled with names of notable male lefties, I kept wondering about the whereabouts of my fellow southpaw ladies. Left-handedness runs in families and is influenced by brain symmetry, but does gender have anything to do with it? Anecdotally, I've met more left-handed guys than girls (when you're left-handed, it can be kind of a big deal to shake left hands with a comrade) and I have a left-handed brother.  Turns out, left-handed females are a much rarer breed than left-handed males. A meta analysis of 144 studies including more than 1.7 million total participants found a "significant and robust" gender correlation with handedness. According to the 2008 study, men have 1.23 times the odds of being left-handed, compared to women's chances. Therefore, that would make the odds of being left-handed lady who marries a left-handed prince on the other side of the Atlantic pretty much mathematically impossible.

Moore  Men's Blog Green Eyes of Channing Tatum GREEN EYES ARE UNUSUAL IN PEOPLE Green eyes are beautiful to look at. They are also extremely unique and very rare ! It has been estimated that only 2% of the worldâs population have true green eyes. To give you an idea of just how special green eyes are, consider this factoid. Currently, it is estimated that around 7 billion people live on the planet. Going by the math, this means only 140 million people have some shade of green as an eye color. There are only a handful of celebrities who have green eyes and even a smaller number who are male. If you are one of these people â consider yourself lucky.    FYI: green eyes can express in several shades, including hazel, emerald, jade and blue-green. In super rare cases, they can even appear amber. When you take into account the different variations of this color, including some people with hues of brown, the number of peopleÂ who can be classified as having green eyes jumps from 2% to 8%. MOST ATTRACTIVE EYE COLOR Guy Counseling recently asked nearly 90,000 website visitors which eye color they considered most attractive (as of 7/4/17). Here are the responses, broken down for each by percentages. Green: 42.8 % Light blue: 22.59 % Hazel: 17.33 Dark Blue: 10.2 Grey: 2% Amber 1% Amethyst: 2% Brown 5% Keep in mind that we are collecting new data from a poll appearing on the bottom of this page.

We will examine how you got your eye color, assess how eye color can be changed and identify a number of famous male celebrities with green eyes. We will also check out some green eyed myths! Other information about various shades of green eye color will be touched upon, including popular hues. Are you ready? Letâs jump right in! What is the science of Green Eyes? Male Green Eyes WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF GREEN EYES? Many people want to know where green eyes come from. Ultimately, eye color is a function of genetics and is determined by two factors: (1) the pigmentation of the iris and (2) the way light scatters around the iris itself. Letâs take a quick look at both. Pigmentation of a personâs iris can run the gamut from the darkest color, black to lightest, blue. Largely influencing pigmentation is something called melanin , a complex polymer made from the amino acid tyrosine. The appearance of green and shades of green (i.e. jade, hazelÂ eyes and emerald) are the result of a Â phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering; which is a 25 cent term used to describe the way light scatters after riding its spectrum wavelength. Most people mistakenly believe that colors like green and blue are in the iris â but theyâre not. Your eye color is a function of how light diffuses across the melanin base, which again is genetically determined. Credit: Wiki Commons GREEN EYES: ORIGINS AND GENES Old theory Prior to 2008, scientists thought eye color was determined by one dominant gene. It was postulated that an eye color hierarchy existed with brown being at the top of the ladder and blue resting at the bottom. Under the old way of thinking, this meant if your dad had brown eyes and your mom had blue eyes, you would likely be born with brown colored eyes. A parental combination of two green eyes would translate into you having green eyes. Recessive genes were also thought to partially influence eye color. New theory New research, presented in a 2008 publication of the American Journal of Human Genetics washed the old way of thinking about eyes and color. The new research suggests that as many as 16 genes may influence the way color is expressed in the iris. The unscientific translation means that a baby can be born with just about any eye color, regardless of what their parents have. It is important to note, however, that hereditary variables need to be factored into the equation. The video below offers an excellent scientific analysis of how people get different color eyes, including green, blue, brown, hazel and some rare variations. GENETIC PREVALENCE OF GREEN EYES Interestingly enough, there are anthropological records of early humans with green eyes living around the mountain system in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This area contained aÂ natural land bridge between Europe and Asia. Knowns as the âSilk Routeâ or âSilk Roadsâ; this ancient passageway was used by early civilizations for the lucrative trade silk, sometimes between 120 BCE â 1450s CE (Yao, et all, 2000). The silk route is thought to be a major reason for the distribution of green eyes WHERE DO GREEN EYES COME FROM? We know from history that Silk Road played an important role in the creation of the civilizations of China, the Goguryeo kingdom in Korea, much of Japan, the Indian subcontinent, parts of Persia and the Horn of Africa and Arabia. Because it served as a significant trade route for many early traders, it is thought that mating between various groups may have been part of gene distribution. This may help to explain why green eyes can be found in various groups across Europe, Africa and Asia. GENETIC ANTHROPOLOGY AND EYE COLOR Genetic anthropology is growing branch of science that examines DNA testing with concrete archaeological, historical and language-based evidence to uncover the history of ancient migration patterns in early human civilizations. Thanks to this emerging area of research, scientists are learning more and more about the etiology of eye color. This is why today, you can have your DNA tested to determine your genetic background. In turn, this may help to explain the genetic reasons for your ocular hue. GREEN EYES AND GEOLOGIC TIME Much of Europe, Asia and Africa and large swaths of the middle east have been native lands to people with green eyes for centuries. When studying the geologic time scale; a tool used to measure our planets history, it is thought that green eyes may have appeared in people of Iranian, Spanish, Brazilian and Pakistani decent sometime during the late part of the Cenozoic period . Specifically, this would be between theÂ Pleistocene and Holocene epochs some 2 to 3 million years ago.  Any race, including people who are Caucasian, Asian, African, Native Indian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic and pre-Colombians (Indigenous Peoples of the Americas) canÂ have green colored eyes.

Many people are curious if eye color can change. The answer is â absolutely! People with green, blue or brown eyes all experience change in color from time to time. Causes for eye color changes include: The way light scatters Mood Health/Medical reasons HOW EYE COLOR CAN CHANGE DUE TO HEALTH The color of your iris can permanently change if you have glaucoma and take certain medications for treatment. If you have light colored eyes and want to keep them, you need to be extremely careful with the glaucoma medications you take. Make sure you consult with your eye doctor to discover all of the facts. Other reasons eye color can change to certain types of diseases. Examples include Hornerâs syndrome and Fuchâs heterochromic iridocyclitis. Should you notice any changes in the color of your eyes, contact your doctor immediately. Green eyes of Tom Welling: Credit insoonia.com GREEN EYES AND HEALTH RISKS If you have green eyes, you are more susceptible to the sunâs harmful radiation. This has to do with our old friend melanin previously mentioned. Simply put, green eyed people can develop certain types of ocular cancers, like intraocular melanoma . People with light colored eyes should wear UV protective sunglasses when outdoors. Jensen Ackles has light green eyes: Credit Fanpop PHENOMENON OF RAYLEIGH SCATTERING As mentioned previously, green eyes, blue eyes and brown eyes do not actually have these colors deposited into the iris. In truth, your eye pigmentation has a little brown in them. Because of the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering, your eyes will reflect back a certain colored hue. Green eyes can come in different shades Green eyes with gold specs of Eddie Redmaybe HOW LIGHT CHANGES EYE COLOR Using the prior mentioned scientific principle of Rayleigh scattering, transformation of light particles that land on the iris will impact its coloristic appearance. This can result in a person having hazel, amber, jade, emerald, blue and even gray! Other factors can influence the shade of green in eyes. Lighting: Artificial lighting (aka: light bulbs) can impact how eye color is experienced. The intensity of the light hitting your iris will either amplify or soften your irisâs appearance.  Time of day: Light from the sun may be more intense earlier in the day or later, which means your iris will âpick-upâ different intensities from the solar spectrum .  Reflective colors: The color of everything around you, including the cloths you have on, can intensify how eye color is experienced. Certain colors, like gold, blue and other greens can amplify the flecks reflecting outward from your Iris.  Makeup: Some people wear eye-makeup, like gold and purple eye-shadow, to accentuate the natural green of the iris. This can cause the desired effect of having chameleon eyes.  Gorgeous makeup makes a line of eye shadow specifically designed for people with green eye color. Allergies: Some people with allergies have âscratchy eyesâ which can cause the surrounding âwhitesâ of the eyes to become red (aka: bloodshot eyes). This can have the effect of amplifying your eye color and creating baggy eyes.Most people do not desire this look.  Emotional state: While your emotional state does not directly change the color of your eyes, what you are feeling at any given point in time can impact how they are perceived. Specifically, if you are depressed and crying, your pupil may dilate, which may give off a darker appearance.  Substances: Use of alcohol, uppers, downers and other kinds of medications can cause your pupils to become larger or smaller. The end result can mean your eye color becomes more intense. Josh Henderson has a green eye and blue eye because of heterochromia. HETEROCHROMIA Some people have a condition called heterochromia that causes one eye to be one color (like green) and the other eye to be a different color (like blue). While multiple causes have been suggested, the current scientific thinking suggests that a lack of genetic diversity is the main reason for heterochromia. It is thought that the condition is caused by a mutation of the genes determining melanin distribution, which often becomes changed due to chromosomal homogeneity. The photograph above of actor Josh Henderson is an example of someone with heterochromia. Notice one of his eyes are green. The other is blue. Very rare and unique. NOTE OF CAUTION If your eye color changes suddenly or if you notice your pupils remain dilated for no apparent reason for an extended period of time, contact your physician immediately. Your eyes are not something you want to play with. What Do Your Eyes Say About You Video Channing Tatum has a unique pair of green eyes that are almost jade.

John Michael  says:   December 14, 2015 at 12:00 am  Thats interesting because I have blond hair and green eyes being the only one in my family. I am a male and have retained these colours all my life. Would these same Iranians be from the area where the ancient civilisation of Media once stood?

But I wasnât.  Really!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 4, 2015 at 8:30 pm  Same here, i feel like in the wrong place   belaboa9  says:   November 4, 2015 at 11:53 pm  Are you the only one with green eyes too?  At least I can fall back on the fact that Iâm 3/4 Irish!  All the boys in my family have blue eyes, and all the girls have brown or hazel.  I feel like an oddball!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 4:43 pm  Yes, among my large family (grandma, uncles, cousins, etc) I am the only one with green eyes. Well, my bio dad has green eyes, but my mum is a single mother, so I barely know him. But itâs not just about the eye colour, itâs something more, like behaviour, itâs strange o:   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 7:52 pm  Are you the black sheep of the family?  I am.  Iâm considered the âweirdâ one because Iâm the smartest, most creative, adventurous, risk-taking and mystical one.  I follow my own path no matter what anyone else says.  And I have snakes! LOL  And two rescue dogs.   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 10:14 pm  Kinda, well, i do not consider myself that smart, but i tell you that my family doesnât even get jokes from the simpsons ð   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 11:07 pm  Bummer.  So how is your behaviour different from the rest of your familyâs?   Alejandro Ontiveroz  says:   February 10, 2016 at 8:02 pm  I have green eyes too and so does my sister. I guess it is because my dad has vary light blue eyes and my mom has semi dark brown eyes. I only know 3 people with green eyes. But i donât think im very attractive. Im a male and i have girl like features. And i have long hair.   belaboa9  says:   February 11, 2016 at 6:36 pm  Yeah, but how old are you?  Most guys arenât their handsomest until theyâre 35-40 years old!   smokeyjofencing  says:   March 6, 2017 at 6:56 pm  yep that would be me too. But have no dogs, love snakes, never had them as pets though.   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:53 pm  EVERYONE has blue eyes! No other colors at all just Blue! Even Aunts an Cousins sea of blue eyes!   belaboa9  says:   June 24, 2016 at 8:39 pm  Like I said to someone else, it must be a really recessive gene that decided to resurface, unless we are adopted, or our daddies arenât really our daddies!  OMG!   smokeyjofencing  says:   March 6, 2017 at 6:54 pm  I know just how you feel. ð   marley  says:   July 29, 2017 at 2:56 pm  I have pure green light eyes that for some reason sparkle   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 1:48 am  I also am the only green eye person in my family. Both parents, and all siblings have blue eyes. Also, all blood relations on both sides have blue eyes. Not one brown eye, and Iâm the one green eye. Itâs always bothered me!   belaboa9  says:   June 22, 2016 at 2:12 pm  Me, too!  Iâve always wondered how many generations back in my family I would have to go, to find another green-eyed person.  Itâs got to come from the Irish side, or maybe thereâs a little bit of gypsy on the Italian side!  In any case, Iâll never know!   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:52 pm  In Nursing School I was told eye color only comes from parents. Iâve wondered about my paternity every since. I am the odd ball! Not just eye color either. To chicken to ask. Lol My mother said IT WAS THE EVIL COMING OUT IN ME when I mentioned it once! Donât know if that was joke, but I never mentioned it again   belaboa9  says:   June 23, 2016 at 1:22 am  LOL!  I learned the same thing in Nursing School!  Thatâs why I always thought I was adopted.  But I wasnât.  Iâve got my birth certificate, and all my baby pictures are in the family albums!  It must be a really recessive gene which has resurfaced! ????  Lucky for us!   Shannon Mullis-Long  says:   October 6, 2015 at 9:31 am  Myself and three cousins have green eyes. My mother has brown my father blue. Mine are constantly changing from blue green to emerald green to grey. No two days are the same and sometimes changing twice or three times a day.

Actually one green, the other one is slightly brown. Not so noticeable fortunately ????   Glen  says:   December 12, 2015 at 9:20 pm  I had blue eyes as a child, which was odd at the time as both my mother and father has brown, (I also had blonde hair as a child but now it is dark brown) Iâm 35 now and my eyeâs are now a deep shade of green and have been since a young age, I am the youngest of 4 and the only other person in my immediate family with green eyes is my eldest brother. I wasnât aware green eyes were considered rare.   Tucker  says:   March 21, 2017 at 6:00 pm  I had blue eyes as a young child but they turned to green before my teens.   John Michael  says:   December 13, 2015 at 11:55 pm  I am a male and have blond hair and 1 green lighter eye and 1 green darker eye. I wonder what the percentages for this is? I am also the only one in my family with it and I thought I was adopted. So I did check with the hospital and Iâm legit. Lol. Use to feel a bit freakish because there a so few of us. Now I know Iâm blessed!   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:47 am  I have very light yellow green eyes with blue around the rim. How does that factor into the green eyed equation? I know that it does come from the Italian side og my family, with only one member of each genation having this particular eye coloe.   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:50 am  Oh, and I not only have a very unusual eye color (only one in my family) but am lefy-handed as well (again the only one in my family). I probably would have been burned at the stake in Salem as a witch. Ha!   Pavel Sivi  says:   February 23, 2016 at 9:42 am  all my famly has different kinds of green eyes. but mine are strange they sometimes seem to be blue and sometimes green. depends on the light. but as far as i see they are green   Karen Denning  says:   April 6, 2016 at 4:49 pm  What is it about green eyes that catches peopleâs attention? It makes me feel uneasy when I notice someone staring at my eyes. From my perspective I seem to be hyper sensitive to light compared to most people. I squint a lot which gives others the impression that Iâm mad or something. LOL   Eric Weeber  says:   June 18, 2016 at 4:51 pm  i know the feeling with that one..mine are light to mid green and i have always squinted alot due to light.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:37 pm  I think in my life about 2 people have commented on my eye colour!

Every eye has itâs own and special shade that makes them beautiful in its way! Yours sure are too! ð   Nicole Lovelace  says:   September 1, 2016 at 9:25 pm  Thatâs not true, green is a beautiful color. Even if they werenât rare, they would still be a popular eye color.   Carla  says:   September 6, 2016 at 6:42 pm  Indeed, but Iâm not talking about preference but about rareness. Think about itâ¦ If 90% of the population had green eyes and only 10% had, for example, brown eyes, which color would be more desiredâ¦ green or brown? I honestly think that itâs more a matter of exclusiveness than color. And please donât think that Iâm saying this beacause I donât love my eye color or something. I actually do have green eyes, I just donât like when people compare themselves with others, just because they donât have what those people do have and donât feel special because of it. If that even makes senseâ¦ :S xD (Sorry if Iâm a little off with my writing skills, not my mother tongue xD, And sorry too for that unnecessary large reply xD)   Michele Kasel  says:   April 29, 2016 at 11:13 pm  i have green eyes and if i wear violet-blue contact lenses they look cool!   i also have brown contactsâi guess i get sorta bored with the same color eyes for 50 years LOL   Gabbyy Fratt  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:33 pm  I have green eyes but if u look close they have a little bit of light brown in the middle then blue all around the rest but farther away they r bright green itâs rlly weird   Carla  says:   May 22, 2016 at 12:50 pm  This only means that you have some shade of hazel eyes. Half brown, half green, and sometimes some blue too!   hunter  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:36 pm  i have green eyes and my parent have them to and my brother and sister and all my other family members have them to   Ann  says:   July 26, 2016 at 6:26 pm  Same with me, except I donât know about extended family.

As far back as I can trace  in family history mostly blue eyes and brown eyes going back to my great grandparents none with green eyes can be found.  I do have one daughter with green eyes the other with blue, their dad has blue eyes. This article I read has a lot of information that is true for me and the trait of having green eyes, however I do believe there is much more information missing due to my age and experience.

I was told I was born with sky blue eyes but they changed color when I was 8-9 month old to green.  All the members of my bio father have green eyes and his father as well.  All my motherâs have brown except for her great grandmma who had blue.  Im older now and notice my eye color is changing to more blue than green, I donât like that!  And never knew they were rare??  I went to grammar school in small town in central Mexico.  Out of a class of about 25, 6 kids had green eyes, WTH??  And I never knew why I was sensitiv to bright light and I hate the sun!!  I was freaked to learn in the poll, I am Latino, a Scorpio and other traits I can relate to LoL!

At the ripe age of 35 my hair went from light brown right back to white/silver. My eye color however remained green. My parents and 4siblings do not have green eyes, only me. Until recently I never gave my eye color much thought but now I think Iâm just a little unique.

Contact Author   What causes people to have green eyes? Green eyes are especially rare. In humans, the pigmentation of an iris can range from very light amber yellow to a very dark brown, bordering on black. The darkness of the iris depends on its concentration of melanin. The amount of melanin in your eyes or skin determines it's color. The greater the concentration of melanin, the darker the eye color. Green eyes possess low to moderate amounts of melanin. However, green is actually not a pigmentation of the iris at all.  The main role of skin pigmentation seems to be to absorb ultraviolet radiation and this is true about the iris of the eyes too.  Rayleigh scattering is the dispersion of light off of air molecules, this helps determine eye color. This same scattering of light occurs in the sky which makes it appear blue, orange, pink, etc. and mountains in the distance appear purple or blue. In the eye, this effect occurs in the top layer (stroma) of the iris. The blue optical effect of the Rayleigh scattering combined with the light to medium melanin pigmentation combines to make the eye appear green.       Origins of Green Eyes   Light Melanin Pigmentation In Green Eyes Light melanin pigmentation mixes with the blue caused by Rayleigh scattering to appear green.   Genetics, Prevelance and Distribution of Green Eyes Only 2% of the world's population has green eyes or about 140 million people. Why do so few people have this trait? The answer boils down to genetics.  Until 2007, it was believed that there was a hierarchy of eye color. Brown was dominant over green, which was dominant over blue. You received two genes for an eye color, one gene from each parent, and whichever was the dominant gene would express itself. Therefore two brown genes would obviously express itself as brown. A brown gene and a blue or green gene would express itself as brown. A green gene and a blue gene would express itself as green. And only a combination of two blue genes would express itself as blue.  The study disproving this Mendelian theory for eye color was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics , and was supported with grants from Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council and the United States of America's National Cancer Institute.  Now it is proven that eye color is controlled by more than one gene; there have been 16 genes that contribute to eye color. This means that there is a chance that a person can inherit virtually any eye color, no matter the eye color of the parents (although the chances for people of certain heritages having a particular eye color are different than for others).  Africa, Asia, Europe, the middle east and the America's have been home to those with green eyes for thousands of years. Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Russia, Spain, and Brazil all have had populations with green eyes for a long time. All races, including Caucasian, African, Asian, Pacific Islanders, Arabic, Hispanic and the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas can also have green eyes. Green eyes most likely developed because of the migration of people over time, those from northern latitudes with light coloring traveled south and people of dark coloring traveling north intermixed, leading to a variation of melanin produced. Today the green eyes of their descendents can be found on every continent.  Notably, there have been records of people with green eyes originating around the Caucasus mountains, which links Europe and Asia. Several passes through the mountain range made it a strategic region or military and trade(silk road).  There is a village in north western China called Liqian in which two-thirds of the inhabitants have green eyes and blonde hair. DNA has linked these people to an ancestor(s) that was caucasian. Some believe that they are descendents of the legendary missing army of Marcus Crassus, a Roman general that disappeared in 36 bc. However Liqian is along the silk road trade route so many people passed through. Until more proof is found, no one is sure if Marcus Crassus and his army were ever in Liqian.  Is it possible there will be more green eyed people in the future due to mass migration and globalization? For now only time will tell.       Chameleon Eyes or Rayleigh Scattering Some people believe green eyes are magical.   Factors That Can Slightly Alter Green Eye Color Because of this, changes in the light being scattered by the iris of lighter colored eyes will change the apparent color of the eyes. This results in "chameleon eyes", or eyes that change color. They fall into the amber, hazel, green, grey, and blue range. Specific factors that can cause the eyes to appear to change colors are:  Mood: Mood plays a role in the color of your eyes. Or rather the optical illusion of eye color.  If you have bloodshot eyes, you may notice your eyes are bright green, this is because of the contrast red/pink is the opposite of green.  Pupil dilation is also a factor and your pupils change size depending on the emotions you feel.  Happiness and also anger cause your pupils to dilate, thus increasing the amount of light let in.  This increases the rayleigh scattering and your eyes may appear more green.  Smaller pupils let less light in, making them appear more grey. This is also a signal you are sad or not feeling well.  Weather: The weather can change the ambient light. There is a big difference between the spectrum of colors in the light cast by a cloudy day, a sunny day, a moonlit night, and a sunset.  Temperature: Temperature can seem correlated to eye color, but this is because the temperature may vary in various lighting situationsâfor example, the lighting in your office when it's cold and cloudy and the windows are drawn vs the lighting in your office when it is sunny and the windows are open.  Colors you are wearing: Wearing certain colors such as blue, yellow, or green will provide more of that color for your eyes to scatter, enhancing that color. Green and gold eyeshadows act similarly. On the flip side, other eyeshadows that make green eyes stand out more are colors in the purple family (plum, lavender, lilac), coppers, and apricot because they contrast with the green, making it stand out even more.  Colors around you: The colors in close proximity to you will act similarly to the colors you are wearing.  Lighting: Artificial lighting can vary to an even greater degree than natural lighting, and the varying spectrums of light will impact your apparent eye color  Again, drastic eye color changes, especially in adults, could be a sign of an eye problem. If they occur, please see your eye doctor.       Heterochromia Source   Medical Reasons for Eye Color Change A color change in the iris can be caused by factors such as radiation, disease, and chemicals. For example, glaucoma medications report a side effect of permanently changing lighter colored eyes to brown. Glaucoma medication was discovered to also have the side effect of lengthening eyelashes and is marketed as an eyelash lengthener. These products are FDA approved under the supervision of a doctor.  Heterochromia is when one of the eyes is a different color from the other one. It can be genetic, from an injury or illness.  If, as an adult, one or both of your eyes changes colors drastically, see a doctor. It could be a symptom of diseases such as Fuchâs heterochromic iridocyclitis, Hornerâs syndrome, or pigmentary glaucoma or something else.  Other health risks for people with lighter colored eyes can come from radiation. Melanin in the iris helps protect eyes from UV sunlight. People with lighter colored eyes, including green, are more at risk for sun-related eye problems including melanoma of the uvea, a type of cancer. People with lighter colored eyes should wear UV-protective sunglasses while outside for extended periods of time.   Personality associations with green eyes A relatively small amount of people have green eyes, it is no wonder that some interesting associations have flourished around the eye color.  These are not proven facts.  Here is a list of some of the perceptions surrounding them:  Green eyes are said to be magical.  People with green eyes tend to have long lasting relationships.  People with green eyes are the most passionate.  Green-eyed people are jealous, as in the saying "green with envy".  Green-eyed people may be more prone to have liver or other digestive problems.  They are a powerful aphrodisiac.  People with green eyes are very inventive.  People with green eyes act spontaneously  People with green eyes are perceived as less trustworthy than blue or brown eyes.  Green eyed people can be more provacative.  Green eyed people are strange!        Eyeshadow on Green Eye Source   Cosmetic Eye Surgery While illegal in the United States, elsewhere in the world iris implants are available with surgery, resulting in light grey eyes. This procedure can sometimes be reversed.  While very few companies offer permanent eye color change for cosmetic reasons, researchers are studying ways to change eye color permanently without the use of implants.   Magical, Mysterious Green Eyes Source   Trivia Bit Here is a bit of interesting trivia, take it with a grain of salt. The International Community for Alien Research conducted a study of potential alien contactees and found that green eyed people were the largest group to report contact!  "Green/Hazel eyes make up 48% of the 1400 contactees that took part in this study and make up 70% of the O Neg. group. Blue eyes making up 36% of the blood types and 23% of the O Neg. group. Brown eyes make up 16% of the study group and 7% of the O Neg. group."       What Color Eyes (natural) Do you have?  Green  Blue  Brown  Hazel  Violet  Red  Grey  Amber  Other See results   About the poll I expect that the majority of the votes in the poll will be "green eyes" because many people that read this article will be curious about their own eye color, thus it will be biased.

Iâve been wondering why me,my dad, and my brother have green eyes and no one else does. My brother has like a yellow Brown in the center of his green eye. My eyes are dark green. And my dadâs are a little lighter than mine. My dads mom is full German and his dad is Scottish-American  hellen 3 weeks ago  all of my family has green eyes  RGP 4 weeks ago  I have bright green eyes, my dad has grey eyes, my mom(rip) had green eyes but on both sides blue eyes are rather dominant.

Glitter 5 weeks ago  Ya the same here a D I'm rh also an I'd have to say same things with me an my life weird not to me but what people are told to be an that's not I guess. Is why I say cause it's weird to most people I'm gifted as Claireaudient I felt I'd come across the same when I searched Glad that someone else I'd thinking I do explore the cosmos out of body it's better than most scientists lol  R N 5 weeks ago  Not sure what color mine are. Hazel, then green, and then grey. Probably hazel.  K in Bama 6 weeks ago  I have bright green eyes. My husband has seas blue eyes with large very bright yellow stars in the middle. Both his parents have ice blue eyes. His older sister has brown eyes with blue rings on the outside. His dad accepted this as possible, but rejected him as a baby because of his weird star eyes. He knows that his sister is not hos dad's, she has the same eyes as her real dad's. He looks just like his dad's family, but his dad still rejects him due to the odd eyes. Because of this, his mom also rejected and blamed him, and gave him away as a child. For this reason he hates his beautiful eyes. We did a hereditary search, along with a DNA test. He is descended from Scotch Lords, English Lords, an ancient line of masculine German Kings, Scandinavians, Greeks, and is over 2% Egyptian. It seems his direct male line existed in Scotland before the Scots. They then became Scots, and then English, before his ancestor went to America. He's heard stories that the weird eyes may have came from Egyptians who migrated. He doesn't know for certain. I just find it so odd that having the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen could cause him so many problems in his child hood. To this day neither of his parents want anything to do with him. Our children were all born with blue eyes, but one turned green later. They are as follows: ice blue with ice blue stars; green with green stars; and ice blue with no stars. They have basically no relationship with his family. I wish that more people would read articles like yours and educate themselves so that children wouldn't have to go through foolishness like that in this day and age.

Brandy 8 months ago  I'm brown eyed, my daughter is the one with grey-green eyes.  When she was born, until she was about 3, she had beautiful denim blue eyes. Then one day, I noticed they had changed.  Not a trace of blue remains. Her father is blue eyed. I have a recessive trait in my family on my mother's side,  which presents green eyes.  My mom and dad were both brown eyed, my sister has green eyes. Her two girls have green eyes, their father having blue. It comes through every generation.

We are American Mutts. Our heritage is all over the place which extends all the way back to Plymouth Rock as well as New Amsterdam. Mother had ocean blue eyes and my father had dark brown eyes. Mine are green and they change color from sage green to bluish-green. The posterior leaf is green but I have a little bit of gold heterochromia on the anterior leaf of both eyes but it only extends from say 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock and radiates out as the light hits. Also I have a heavy limbal ring around my pupils. It used to be black but as I have aged it has become a dark grey with a blue tint. I also have Wolfflin nodules that are light green which I was told by the optometrist is highly rare. He said they are usually white or yellow. My right eye also has a few transparent gold "freckles" which are absent from the left eye. My eyes also glow with an iridescence that my mother said "looked evil".  I find my eyes fascinating as do most people. Green eyes have a lot myths regarding them but I personally loved my mothers ocean blue eyes. They were so beautiful.  someone 9 months ago  my mum has blue eyes and my dad has brown...yet somehow i have green eyes.  PS 9 months ago  I was in St. Petersburg Russia on vacation and noticed how many women had stunning green eyes and light even tanned skin.  Beautiful.  I figured it had something to do with their genetics related to the area.  Mrs. White 9 months ago  There is more to heterochromia. There is full heterochromia which you have listed here in your hub, it is where the eyes are each 2 different colors, then there is sectoral heterochromia which is a section or multiple sections in one or both of the eyes that is a different color than the rest of the iris. Then there is central heterochromia, which I personally have, it is were your iris is one color (blue, green, brown, amber, etc) and then there is a completely different color center ring, mine is chartreuse green inner circle and sky blue/grey outer iris with a dark blue limbal ring.  Each of these heterochromia eyes can be any combo as long as its different colors.  Amber 9 months ago  Both of my parents have brown eyes and mine are green....

Ace 11 months ago  Green Eyes and O- blood type here.  anybody else have that?  Silveria 11 months ago  All my life I have wondered why the majority of my family was born with either blue or green eyes, though we are of Mexican descent.  After a recent DNA test, I was pleasantly shocked to find out we were 70% European, with the remaining Latino, Native American and African descent.  I myself have green eyes, unlike my father who was born blond and blue-eyed.  With these traits in mind, I am reminded my DNA test also informed me I am 10% Irish!   I am now proud to say I am a proud Mexican Irish American!  Gracias, for listening!

Michael 12 months ago  Strange that both my mother and father had brown eyes and I have hazel (green)! When I get really angry or deeply emotionally upset, both eyes are golden! There's not even a hint of green in them, only bright gold striations and light grey back-grounding and pupilary dilation. My mother told me long ago that I've had that condition since early childhood when I first displayed my "Irish Temper" inherited from my father who is 1st generation Irish from both his parents. And I have to agree, weather definitely does play a role in changing my eye color from time-to-time.  Denise 12 months ago  my eyes are hazel. It all depends on the color I am wearing.  Some photos look like i have a deep blue almost purple eye color and others show a sharp green color.  Alexan 12 months ago  When I was little I had icy blue eye but eventually they changed to bright green.  Nyan cat 12 months ago  My eyes are green and they are orange in middle illuminati?? Probably not......  Cheryl 13 months ago  I have dark brown eyes, my husband has baby blue eyes.  My father, sister and brother all have hazel eyes. My mom has brown. My son and daughter have hazel eyes.  All of my husbands family has baby blue eyes.  Found this article interesting.  Tammy 13 months ago  I was born with different coloured eyes. The right eye has always been brown. The left eye would change with the weather. It was mostly a greenish/grey and on nice days appear more blueish. It nows stays more green all the time with less change. School was always fun as Science teachers were especially fascinated. My father's eyes were blue and my mother's were hazel.  We do not know of anyone on either side that had brown eyes. I guess I'm very unique and don't mind it a bit!!  Gus C 13 months ago  My mom told me I was born with grey blue eyes til about 9 months when they began to change color to green.  As of lately with cell phone pictures, I keep noticing more blue in them than ever before.  I'm panicked and hope they don't revert to blue again!!!  Mom's side all have brown eyes but her great grandmother had blue-green, on my father's all have green back to 4 generations.  I am Mexican and went to grammar school there and in a class of 22 kids, 6 had green eyes and one blue-green, go figure!  I like my green eyes and had no clue they were rare, I thought they were as common as blue??  Now I know, thank you God!!!  Karen 13 months ago  I have really cool greenish yellow eyes. When I am in the sun they glow bright yellow with a dark green ring around the outside. I love them and everyone I know loves them also. I have to wear heavy eye liner and lots of mascara and it makes them pop awesome. They say eyes change by the time your kids are 9 months but my son is almost 12 and his changed from Blue to greenish blue about 3 years ago. They are getting greener as he gets older. Needless to say I'm so happy he got my eyes. Lol ... my eyes are sensitive to the sun and if I get a headache my eyes hurt very bad by any light. I guess that's the trade offf for having really cool rare eyes. I really enjoyed this atical.  Lizzy 13 months ago  Can I just say, I recently found out that I genuinely have green eyes. My whole life I thought they were hazel as I always saw pictures of 'green eyes' of people who were wearing contact lenses but then I started seeing images of eyes that looked almost exactly like mine and realised I truly have green eyes. I feel special now so I'm smiles  Jesse 13 months ago  I'm the only one in my parents family with green eyes. My wife has brown eyes. All 4 of our children have green eyes. However, when I was a child my eyes were brown, turning green in my teens. Myself and my four siblings were born with very blond almost white hair, changing to brown or dirty blond during the teens. The same thing is happening to my kids.  Emily 14 months ago  I found this article interesting. My dad has brown-amberish eyes because he is partly Native American. My mom has a lot of German and some Irish in her, hence why she has blue-grey-green eyes... My older sister has hazel eyes, being mostly brown, and my little sister has pretty cool amber like eyes. My twin brother has hazel eyes being mostly greenish. I have green eyes. My eyes are pretty sensitive to light, but when I am in the sun, my friends ooh and aww over my eye color. They say that they "pop" or "glow" green. I really enjoy having green eyes, but it also bothers me that they are not completely green... my right eye is darker than the left; it has dark green, a slight lining of brownish green, specks (more like streaks) of grey, and more shades of green. My left eye is cool. It is lighter like I said, and it has light green mixed with bright grey, and only one tiny speck of brown at the bottom. The right half of that eye is a shade darker than the other halfâ¦ it is almost completely dark green, while the other half is a bright grey- greenâ¦ If the sun hits my eyes at the right angle, and if I am happy (emotion can change the eye dilation then changing the density of the melanin) then you can see the slightest bit of blue. Why are my eyes this way? I have brunette hair with a slight tinge of red. What exactly does this have to do with genetics?... I mean, is incomplete dominance or codominance with eye color traits playing a role here?  salah 14 months ago  my father has green eyes and my mom has brown,now me and my 2 sisters has green eyes and my brother has brown  CanadaGirl 14 months ago  It funny. My dad has green,greysh eyes, my mom as brown eyes. I have green. Like others I have had blue eyes when I was a baby. My mom is Italian, German, Lebanese and Portuguese-Portugal.  My dad is 100 percent Italian and I have tan skin and brown hair.  Evelyn 14 months ago  I only read this article because I find green eyes quite interesting and I was planning to make the main character of my book have green eyes as well. I have brown eyes though but they're so dark people say they're black and its a fact that its impossible to have black eyes. (BTW I changed my mind about making my main character have brown eyes, I'm gonna make them violet.)  Meriale 14 months ago  This is quite interesting. But there are some facts left out of the article... for instance... most all green eyed people are highly intelligent. Most all Green eyed people do have colour changes depending on their moods... such as my eyes can go from a deep emerald green with amber flecks to a more olive green with yellow and brown flecks.  My husband's eyes changed from a pale light green to a baby blue. Go figure.  I have 10 brothers and sisters and out of 10 only 2 of us have green eyes... my mother had emerald green eyes and my dad had a brilliant blue. 4 of my siblings have the brilliant blue like my father and the other 4 have brown.  I had 2 children and both have a cerulean blue with a dark blue ring around the iris. My grandfather on my mother's side had those eyes.  Out of my 3 grandchildren, 2 have light blue and 1 has eyes like a prism. His iris's are made up of every colour there is... flecks of Dark blue, light blue, green, grey, brown and amber with a dark blue ring. I've never seen eyes like his in all my life.  They're just beautiful.  I used to wish I had blue eyes like my father and siblings... but now I'm proud to have green eyes. I think all eye colours are beautiful, though. Everyone is unique in their own way.  Luis 15 months ago  Both of my parents have brown eye and so do all of my family (they Mexican) but for some reason they're dark and so are my sibling I'm the oldest, and for some reason I look white ( I also have green eyes) but nobody in my family that I know of have green eyes! I've asked if I was like adopted but I'm not and I just find it weird how Mexicans are so diversed because also one of my moms sisters looks black and so do her kids, and my moms brother well he looks a little Asian but they all have the same father, but in my case my family is very dark but for me I don't look very related to them because again I look white, born with blue but now green eyes, dark brown hair, and I they only other person in my family with colored eyes is my sister which hers are hazel. But I consider myself lucky. I always get complaints from strangers about my eyes  Ashley Calloway 15 months ago  Team Green  Nell Rose 15 months ago  from England How interesting!
