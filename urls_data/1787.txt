Suppose we have a completely shuffled standard deck of cards. It includes 52 cards, 13 from each figure. If we pick a card at random, we have a chance of 13/52 = 1/4 of picking a heart. Therefore, the probability of picking a heart at random is 0.25.               Av9765  1 Contribution      Probability of picking a winning 3 digit lottery number?  One out of a thousand  ^^^This is not quite true. If you must match them in order, then this is correct. However, if order does not matter (i.e. 4-5-6 is the same as 6-4-5), then the probability increases.  The reason is that the probability is no longer 1/10*1/10*1/10, since this would assume that all three are unrelated. If order doesn't matter, then 4-5-6 = 6-4-5 = 5-4-6 = ... and so on, and all of these win. Thus, the answer is (all the different ways you can write the 3 digit number)/1000.               CogitoErgoCogitoSum  136 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter picked at random is a vowel?  Well, consider that there are 26 letters in the alphabet. 5 of these are vowels (a, e, i, o and u).    Therefore the probability is 5/26 - or 0.192307692.    This assumes, of course, that you are randomly picking a letter from the alphabet... or rather, that each letter occurs in equal proportion within a larger text.    This assumes the English alphabet. In other alphabets from other languages, there may be a different quantity of vowels and a different quantity of consonants (or possibly other letters all together).    In writing, however, it is not the case that each letter appears in equal proportion. In a typical written document, for example, vowels make up about 38% of a text, on average. But it depends on a particular text, too, it may vary a little.    Of course, it matters which language you draw a text from. Those languages which use the exact same alphabet as in English dont necessarily have the same distribution of vowels in text.

Phelikx  1,925 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter picked at random is not a vowel?  To work out probability you have to know the number of possible options, and how many of those options meet the criteria. In this case there are 26 possible options (all the letters) and 21 that meet the criteria (21 non-vowels). The probability is the number that match divided by the total number possible. In this case it would be 21/26. This comes out to approximately 0.80769.

In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; 2. Permutation of the letters P ans S (PXXXXS or SXXXXP) = 2! =2; 3. Permutation of the 4 letters between P and S = 4! =24; 4. Permutations of the 7 units {P(S)XXXXS(P)}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X} = 7! = 5040; 5. We should divide multiplication of the above 4 numbers by 2! as there is repeated T. Hence:  \(\frac{10C4*2!*4!*7!}{2!}=25,401,600\) 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? There are 11 letters in the word "MISSISSIPPI ", out of which: M=1, I=4, S=4, P=2. Total # of permutations is \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}\); # of permutations with 4 I's together is \(\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Consider 4 I's as one unit: {M}{S}{S}{S}{S}{P}{P}{IIII} - total 8 units, out of which {M}=1, {S}=4, {P}=2, {IIII}=1. So # of permutations with 4 I's not come together is: \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}-\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Hope it helps. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

How can there be six units that have one letter each? It seems that you don't understand what the question is asking. It does not ask about the ways 4 lettter can be arranged between P and S. The question is: in how many ways can the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged SO THAT in each arrangement there are always 4 letters between P and S. This should be calculated in several steps. Step 4 is dealing with arrangement of 7 units: P and S with 4 letters between them (as required) is one unit {PXXXXS} so we used 6 letters, EACH of the rest 6 letters is a separate unit itself so we have total of 7 units: {PXXXXS}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X} --> 7!. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

So # of permutations with 4 I's not come together is: \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}-\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Hope it helps. What about my approach to PERMUTATIONS? The word permutations consists of 12 letters. You can choose P and S in 7*2 ways so there are always 4 numbers between them P on first, S on fifth ........ P on seventh S on twelwth +  reversely (SP) You are left with 10 letters, 2 of which are the same (TT) So the complete formula is: \(7*2*\frac{10!}{2!}=7*10!\) It makes the same result, but I think is a bit quicker. _________________  You want somethin', go get it.

Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; 2. Permutation of the letters P ans S (PXXXXS or SXXXXP) = 2! =2; 3. Permutation of the 4 letters between P and S = 4! =24; 4. Permutations of the 7 units {P(S)XXXXS(P)}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X} = 7! = 5040; 5. We should divide multiplication of the above 4 numbers by 2! as there is repeated T. Hence:  \(\frac{10C4*2!*4!*7!}{2!}=25,401,600\) 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? There are 11 letters in the word "MISSISSIPPI ", out of which: M=1, I=4, S=4, P=2. Total # of permutations is \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}\); # of permutations with 4 I's together is \(\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Consider 4 I's as one unit: {M}{S}{S}{S}{S}{P}{P}{IIII} - total 8 units, out of which {M}=1, {S}=4, {P}=2, {IIII}=1. So # of permutations with 4 I's not come together is: \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}-\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Hope it helps. What about my approach to PERMUTATIONS? The word permutations consists of 12 letters. You can choose P and S in 7*2 ways so there are always 4 numbers between them P on first, S on fifth ........ P on seventh S on twelwth +  reversely (SP) You are left with 10 letters, 2 of which are the same (TT) So the complete formula is: \(7*2*\frac{10!}{2!}=7*10!\) It makes the same result, but I think is a bit quicker. This approach is also correct. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? PERMUTATIONS: Total length of the word = 12 Repetitions: T:2. Rest all letters:1 P,S can occupy following indices in the word {1,6},{2,7},{3,8},{4,9},{5,10},{6,11},{7,12} In each of the above positions that P and S occupy, the remaining 10 letters can be arranged in \(\frac{10!}{2!}\) ways Likewise; S,P can occupy following indices: {1,6},{2,7},{3,8},{4,9},{5,10},{6,11},{7,12} In each of the above positions that S and P occupy, the remaining 10 letters can be arranged in \(\frac{10!}{2!}\) ways So, total number of arrangements: \(\frac{7*2*10!}{2!}\) 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? Word MISSISSIPPI Length: 11 Repetitions: I:4 S:4 P:2 M:1 Total number of arrangement possible = \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}\) ------------Ist Now, let's conjoin four I's and treat it as a unique character, say #. We have conjoined all fours in order to symbolize that all I's are adhered together. So, Now MISSISSIPPI becomes M#SSSSPP Word: M#SSSSPP Length: 8 Repetitions: S:4 P:2 M:1 #:1 The number of ways in which I's come together is: \(\frac{8!}{2!4!}\)           --------- 2nd Thus, the number of arrangements in which I's not come together will be the difference between 2nd and Ist \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}-\frac{8!}{2!4!}\) _________________  ~fluke GMAT Club Premium Membership - big benefits and savings                          144144      Senior Manager           Joined: 08 Nov 2010   Posts: 361   WE 1: Business Development                        Re: Interesting problems of Permutations and Combinations [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     05 Feb 2011, 04:59      geeeesh bunuel... amazing explanation. _________________   GMAT Club Premium Membership - big benefits and savings                            ParmarKarishma      Intern           Joined: 15 Mar 2013   Posts: 5                       Permutations Question [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     05 Jul 2013, 09:35      I n how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S?

In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice.

Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; Hi, As you have chosen 4 letters out of 10 letters which include two TT's, would it not lead to duplication of the selections? As in the case of "ENTRANCE", if we had to choose the number of selections, we would go as follows - We have 8 letters from which 6 are unique. Possible scenarios for 4 letter selection are: A. All letters are different; B. 2 N-s and other letters are different; C. 2 E-s and other letters are different; D. 2 N-s, 2 E-s. Let's count them separately: A. All letters are different, means that basically we are choosing 4 letters form 6 distinct letters: 6C4=15; B. 2 N-s and other letters are different: 2C2(2 N-s out of 2)*5C2(other 2 letters from distinct 5 letters left)=10; C. 2 E-s and other letters are different: 2C2(2 E-s out of 2)*5C2(other 2 letters from distinct 5 letters left)=10;; D. 2 N-s, 2 E-s: 2C2*2C2=1. 15+10+10+1=36                          sanaexam      Intern           Joined: 01 Sep 2016   Posts: 33                      Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     15 Sep 2016, 02:59      is this a gmat type question?                        rsgooga      Intern        B     Joined: 29 Jun 2016   Posts: 18                      Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     06 May 2017, 05:46      I am too a little confused. If we have two T's then number of combination should go down while selecting 4 numbers out of 10. E.g. AABC, If we have to choose 2 letters from these 4 then we will have following options: AB, BC, AC, AA = 4 But if we apply combination formula 4C2 then answer will be 6. A little confused, if anyone can guide.                    gmatclubot          Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     06 May 2017, 05:46                         Print view    First unread post            Display posts from previous: All posts 1 day 7 days 2 weeks 1 month 3 months 6 months 1 year   Sort by Author Post time Subject    Ascending Descending                In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be          new topic       post reply       Question banks     Downloads     My Bookmarks     Reviews     Important topics        Moderators:  chetan2u , Bunuel , niks18 , mikemcgarry , VeritasPrepKarishma , generis                 Search for:           10 Latest Posts     Yale Profile Evaluation Thread - Post All Requests Here     8 mins     mbaMissionKate       the number of female medical students is equivalent to the number of m     9 mins     selim       Japanese researchers are producing a series of robots that can     9 mins     egmat       DOWNLOAD: Work rate problems & answers document     14 mins     bumpbot       Unlike the brain of a chickadee that lives in ...     14 mins     FillFM       Stuck at 680-700 mark!

In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; 2. Permutation of the letters P ans S (PXXXXS or SXXXXP) = 2! =2; 3. Permutation of the 4 letters between P and S = 4! =24; 4. Permutations of the 7 units {P(S)XXXXS(P)}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X} = 7! = 5040; 5. We should divide multiplication of the above 4 numbers by 2! as there is repeated T. Hence:  \(\frac{10C4*2!*4!*7!}{2!}=25,401,600\) 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? There are 11 letters in the word "MISSISSIPPI ", out of which: M=1, I=4, S=4, P=2. Total # of permutations is \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}\); # of permutations with 4 I's together is \(\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Consider 4 I's as one unit: {M}{S}{S}{S}{S}{P}{P}{IIII} - total 8 units, out of which {M}=1, {S}=4, {P}=2, {IIII}=1. So # of permutations with 4 I's not come together is: \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}-\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Hope it helps. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

How can there be six units that have one letter each? It seems that you don't understand what the question is asking. It does not ask about the ways 4 lettter can be arranged between P and S. The question is: in how many ways can the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged SO THAT in each arrangement there are always 4 letters between P and S. This should be calculated in several steps. Step 4 is dealing with arrangement of 7 units: P and S with 4 letters between them (as required) is one unit {PXXXXS} so we used 6 letters, EACH of the rest 6 letters is a separate unit itself so we have total of 7 units: {PXXXXS}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X} --> 7!. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

You can choose P and S in 7*2 ways so there are always 4 numbers between them P on first, S on fifth ........ P on seventh S on twelwth +  reversely (SP) You are left with 10 letters, 2 of which are the same (TT) So the complete formula is: \(7*2*\frac{10!}{2!}=7*10!\) It makes the same result, but I think is a bit quicker. _________________  You want somethin', go get it.

In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? PERMUTATIONS: Total length of the word = 12 Repetitions: T:2. Rest all letters:1 P,S can occupy following indices in the word {1,6},{2,7},{3,8},{4,9},{5,10},{6,11},{7,12} In each of the above positions that P and S occupy, the remaining 10 letters can be arranged in \(\frac{10!}{2!}\) ways Likewise; S,P can occupy following indices: {1,6},{2,7},{3,8},{4,9},{5,10},{6,11},{7,12} In each of the above positions that S and P occupy, the remaining 10 letters can be arranged in \(\frac{10!}{2!}\) ways So, total number of arrangements: \(\frac{7*2*10!}{2!}\) 2.

Let me know your views on them. They may not necessarily be of GMAT format. Please share your views, nevertheless. 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; Hi, As you have chosen 4 letters out of 10 letters which include two TT's, would it not lead to duplication of the selections? As in the case of "ENTRANCE", if we had to choose the number of selections, we would go as follows - We have 8 letters from which 6 are unique. Possible scenarios for 4 letter selection are: A. All letters are different; B. 2 N-s and other letters are different; C. 2 E-s and other letters are different; D. 2 N-s, 2 E-s. Let's count them separately: A. All letters are different, means that basically we are choosing 4 letters form 6 distinct letters: 6C4=15; B. 2 N-s and other letters are different: 2C2(2 N-s out of 2)*5C2(other 2 letters from distinct 5 letters left)=10; C. 2 E-s and other letters are different: 2C2(2 E-s out of 2)*5C2(other 2 letters from distinct 5 letters left)=10;; D. 2 N-s, 2 E-s: 2C2*2C2=1. 15+10+10+1=36                          sanaexam      Intern           Joined: 01 Sep 2016   Posts: 33                      Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     15 Sep 2016, 02:59      is this a gmat type question?                        rsgooga      Intern        B     Joined: 29 Jun 2016   Posts: 18                      Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     06 May 2017, 05:46      I am too a little confused. If we have two T's then number of combination should go down while selecting 4 numbers out of 10. E.g. AABC, If we have to choose 2 letters from these 4 then we will have following options: AB, BC, AC, AA = 4 But if we apply combination formula 4C2 then answer will be 6. A little confused, if anyone can guide.                    gmatclubot          Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     06 May 2017, 05:46                         Print view    First unread post            Display posts from previous: All posts 1 day 7 days 2 weeks 1 month 3 months 6 months 1 year   Sort by Author Post time Subject    Ascending Descending                In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be          new topic       post reply       Question banks     Downloads     My Bookmarks     Reviews     Important topics        Moderators:  chetan2u , Bunuel , niks18 , mikemcgarry , VeritasPrepKarishma , generis                 Search for:           10 Latest Posts     Yale Profile Evaluation Thread - Post All Requests Here     8 mins     mbaMissionKate       the number of female medical students is equivalent to the number of m     9 mins     selim       Japanese researchers are producing a series of robots that can     9 mins     egmat       DOWNLOAD: Work rate problems & answers document     14 mins     bumpbot       Unlike the brain of a chickadee that lives in ...     14 mins     FillFM       Stuck at 680-700 mark!

Therefore, the probability of picking a heart at random is 0.25.               Av9765  1 Contribution      Probability of picking a winning 3 digit lottery number?  One out of a thousand  ^^^This is not quite true. If you must match them in order, then this is correct. However, if order does not matter (i.e. 4-5-6 is the same as 6-4-5), then the probability increases.  The reason is that the probability is no longer 1/10*1/10*1/10, since this would assume that all three are unrelated. If order doesn't matter, then 4-5-6 = 6-4-5 = 5-4-6 = ... and so on, and all of these win. Thus, the answer is (all the different ways you can write the 3 digit number)/1000.               CogitoErgoCogitoSum  136 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter picked at random is a vowel?  Well, consider that there are 26 letters in the alphabet. 5 of these are vowels (a, e, i, o and u).    Therefore the probability is 5/26 - or 0.192307692.    This assumes, of course, that you are randomly picking a letter from the alphabet... or rather, that each letter occurs in equal proportion within a larger text.    This assumes the English alphabet. In other alphabets from other languages, there may be a different quantity of vowels and a different quantity of consonants (or possibly other letters all together).    In writing, however, it is not the case that each letter appears in equal proportion. In a typical written document, for example, vowels make up about 38% of a text, on average. But it depends on a particular text, too, it may vary a little.    Of course, it matters which language you draw a text from. Those languages which use the exact same alphabet as in English dont necessarily have the same distribution of vowels in text.

Phelikx  1,925 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter picked at random is not a vowel?  To work out probability you have to know the number of possible options, and how many of those options meet the criteria. In this case there are 26 possible options (all the letters) and 21 that meet the criteria (21 non-vowels). The probability is the number that match divided by the total number possible. In this case it would be 21/26. This comes out to approximately 0.80769.

In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; 2. Permutation of the letters P ans S (PXXXXS or SXXXXP) = 2! =2; 3. Permutation of the 4 letters between P and S = 4! =24; 4. Permutations of the 7 units {P(S)XXXXS(P)}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X} = 7! = 5040; 5. We should divide multiplication of the above 4 numbers by 2! as there is repeated T. Hence:  \(\frac{10C4*2!*4!*7!}{2!}=25,401,600\) 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? There are 11 letters in the word "MISSISSIPPI ", out of which: M=1, I=4, S=4, P=2. Total # of permutations is \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}\); # of permutations with 4 I's together is \(\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Consider 4 I's as one unit: {M}{S}{S}{S}{S}{P}{P}{IIII} - total 8 units, out of which {M}=1, {S}=4, {P}=2, {IIII}=1. So # of permutations with 4 I's not come together is: \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}-\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Hope it helps. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

How can there be six units that have one letter each? It seems that you don't understand what the question is asking. It does not ask about the ways 4 lettter can be arranged between P and S. The question is: in how many ways can the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged SO THAT in each arrangement there are always 4 letters between P and S. This should be calculated in several steps. Step 4 is dealing with arrangement of 7 units: P and S with 4 letters between them (as required) is one unit {PXXXXS} so we used 6 letters, EACH of the rest 6 letters is a separate unit itself so we have total of 7 units: {PXXXXS}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X} --> 7!. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

You can choose P and S in 7*2 ways so there are always 4 numbers between them P on first, S on fifth ........ P on seventh S on twelwth +  reversely (SP) You are left with 10 letters, 2 of which are the same (TT) So the complete formula is: \(7*2*\frac{10!}{2!}=7*10!\) It makes the same result, but I think is a bit quicker. _________________  You want somethin', go get it.

In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? PERMUTATIONS: Total length of the word = 12 Repetitions: T:2. Rest all letters:1 P,S can occupy following indices in the word {1,6},{2,7},{3,8},{4,9},{5,10},{6,11},{7,12} In each of the above positions that P and S occupy, the remaining 10 letters can be arranged in \(\frac{10!}{2!}\) ways Likewise; S,P can occupy following indices: {1,6},{2,7},{3,8},{4,9},{5,10},{6,11},{7,12} In each of the above positions that S and P occupy, the remaining 10 letters can be arranged in \(\frac{10!}{2!}\) ways So, total number of arrangements: \(\frac{7*2*10!}{2!}\) 2.

My approach: Lets consider P_ _ _ _ S be a single letter. The total number of letters in PERMUTATIONS = 12 6 letters would be consumed in P_ _ _ _ S, so we have to arrange 7 letters. Hence 7! Now for the two Ts 7!/2! and for arranging four letters between P and S. (7!/2!) 4! Is this the right solution? I am not sure if additional multiplication should be done for selecting these four letters from the remaining 10 letters. Any help is much appreciated.

In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; Hi, As you have chosen 4 letters out of 10 letters which include two TT's, would it not lead to duplication of the selections? As in the case of "ENTRANCE", if we had to choose the number of selections, we would go as follows - We have 8 letters from which 6 are unique. Possible scenarios for 4 letter selection are: A. All letters are different; B. 2 N-s and other letters are different; C. 2 E-s and other letters are different; D. 2 N-s, 2 E-s. Let's count them separately: A. All letters are different, means that basically we are choosing 4 letters form 6 distinct letters: 6C4=15; B. 2 N-s and other letters are different: 2C2(2 N-s out of 2)*5C2(other 2 letters from distinct 5 letters left)=10; C. 2 E-s and other letters are different: 2C2(2 E-s out of 2)*5C2(other 2 letters from distinct 5 letters left)=10;; D. 2 N-s, 2 E-s: 2C2*2C2=1. 15+10+10+1=36                          sanaexam      Intern           Joined: 01 Sep 2016   Posts: 33                      Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     15 Sep 2016, 02:59      is this a gmat type question?                        rsgooga      Intern        B     Joined: 29 Jun 2016   Posts: 18                      Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     06 May 2017, 05:46      I am too a little confused. If we have two T's then number of combination should go down while selecting 4 numbers out of 10. E.g. AABC, If we have to choose 2 letters from these 4 then we will have following options: AB, BC, AC, AA = 4 But if we apply combination formula 4C2 then answer will be 6. A little confused, if anyone can guide.                    gmatclubot          Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     06 May 2017, 05:46                         Print view    First unread post            Display posts from previous: All posts 1 day 7 days 2 weeks 1 month 3 months 6 months 1 year   Sort by Author Post time Subject    Ascending Descending                In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be          new topic       post reply       Question banks     Downloads     My Bookmarks     Reviews     Important topics        Moderators:  chetan2u , Bunuel , niks18 , mikemcgarry , VeritasPrepKarishma , generis                 Search for:           10 Latest Posts     Yale Profile Evaluation Thread - Post All Requests Here     8 mins     mbaMissionKate       the number of female medical students is equivalent to the number of m     9 mins     selim       Japanese researchers are producing a series of robots that can     9 mins     egmat       DOWNLOAD: Work rate problems & answers document     14 mins     bumpbot       Unlike the brain of a chickadee that lives in ...     14 mins     FillFM       Stuck at 680-700 mark!

Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; 2. Permutation of the letters P ans S (PXXXXS or SXXXXP) = 2! =2; 3. Permutation of the 4 letters between P and S = 4! =24; 4. Permutations of the 7 units {P(S)XXXXS(P)}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X} = 7! = 5040; 5. We should divide multiplication of the above 4 numbers by 2! as there is repeated T. Hence:  \(\frac{10C4*2!*4!*7!}{2!}=25,401,600\) 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? There are 11 letters in the word "MISSISSIPPI ", out of which: M=1, I=4, S=4, P=2. Total # of permutations is \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}\); # of permutations with 4 I's together is \(\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Consider 4 I's as one unit: {M}{S}{S}{S}{S}{P}{P}{IIII} - total 8 units, out of which {M}=1, {S}=4, {P}=2, {IIII}=1. So # of permutations with 4 I's not come together is: \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}-\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Hope it helps. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

The question is: in how many ways can the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged SO THAT in each arrangement there are always 4 letters between P and S. This should be calculated in several steps. Step 4 is dealing with arrangement of 7 units: P and S with 4 letters between them (as required) is one unit {PXXXXS} so we used 6 letters, EACH of the rest 6 letters is a separate unit itself so we have total of 7 units: {PXXXXS}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X}, {X} --> 7!. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; 2. Permutation of the letters P ans S (PXXXXS or SXXXXP) = 2! =2; 3. Permutation of the 4 letters between P and S = 4! =24; 4. Permutations of the 7 units {P(S)XXXXS(P)}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X}{X} = 7! = 5040; 5. We should divide multiplication of the above 4 numbers by 2! as there is repeated T. Hence:  \(\frac{10C4*2!*4!*7!}{2!}=25,401,600\) 2. In how many of the distinct permutations of the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI do the 4 I's not come together? There are 11 letters in the word "MISSISSIPPI ", out of which: M=1, I=4, S=4, P=2. Total # of permutations is \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}\); # of permutations with 4 I's together is \(\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Consider 4 I's as one unit: {M}{S}{S}{S}{S}{P}{P}{IIII} - total 8 units, out of which {M}=1, {S}=4, {P}=2, {IIII}=1. So # of permutations with 4 I's not come together is: \(\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}-\frac{8!}{4!2!}\). Hope it helps. What about my approach to PERMUTATIONS? The word permutations consists of 12 letters. You can choose P and S in 7*2 ways so there are always 4 numbers between them P on first, S on fifth ........ P on seventh S on twelwth +  reversely (SP) You are left with 10 letters, 2 of which are the same (TT) So the complete formula is: \(7*2*\frac{10!}{2!}=7*10!\) It makes the same result, but I think is a bit quicker. _________________  You want somethin', go get it.

In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? PERMUTATIONS: Total length of the word = 12 Repetitions: T:2.

Cheers THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). Back to the original questions: 1. In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be arranged if there are always 4 letters between P and S? There are 12 letters in the word "PERMUTATIONS", out of which T is repeated twice. 1. Choosing 4 letters out of 10 (12-2(P and S)=10) to place between P and S = 10C4 = 210; Hi, As you have chosen 4 letters out of 10 letters which include two TT's, would it not lead to duplication of the selections? As in the case of "ENTRANCE", if we had to choose the number of selections, we would go as follows - We have 8 letters from which 6 are unique. Possible scenarios for 4 letter selection are: A. All letters are different; B. 2 N-s and other letters are different; C. 2 E-s and other letters are different; D. 2 N-s, 2 E-s. Let's count them separately: A. All letters are different, means that basically we are choosing 4 letters form 6 distinct letters: 6C4=15; B. 2 N-s and other letters are different: 2C2(2 N-s out of 2)*5C2(other 2 letters from distinct 5 letters left)=10; C. 2 E-s and other letters are different: 2C2(2 E-s out of 2)*5C2(other 2 letters from distinct 5 letters left)=10;; D. 2 N-s, 2 E-s: 2C2*2C2=1. 15+10+10+1=36                          sanaexam      Intern           Joined: 01 Sep 2016   Posts: 33                      Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     15 Sep 2016, 02:59      is this a gmat type question?                        rsgooga      Intern        B     Joined: 29 Jun 2016   Posts: 18                      Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     06 May 2017, 05:46      I am too a little confused. If we have two T's then number of combination should go down while selecting 4 numbers out of 10. E.g. AABC, If we have to choose 2 letters from these 4 then we will have following options: AB, BC, AC, AA = 4 But if we apply combination formula 4C2 then answer will be 6. A little confused, if anyone can guide.                    gmatclubot          Re: In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be [ #permalink ]     06 May 2017, 05:46                         Print view    First unread post            Display posts from previous: All posts 1 day 7 days 2 weeks 1 month 3 months 6 months 1 year   Sort by Author Post time Subject    Ascending Descending                In how many ways can the letters of the word PERMUTATIONS be          new topic       post reply       Question banks     Downloads     My Bookmarks     Reviews     Important topics        Moderators:  chetan2u , Bunuel , niks18 , mikemcgarry , VeritasPrepKarishma , generis                 Search for:           10 Latest Posts     Yale Profile Evaluation Thread - Post All Requests Here     8 mins     mbaMissionKate       the number of female medical students is equivalent to the number of m     9 mins     selim       Japanese researchers are producing a series of robots that can     9 mins     egmat       DOWNLOAD: Work rate problems & answers document     14 mins     bumpbot       Unlike the brain of a chickadee that lives in ...     14 mins     FillFM       Stuck at 680-700 mark!

The probablity that you are asking is equal 1 minus the probablity of four consonants. Hence you are picking up 4 consonats from 6, 0 vowels from 3, and generally 4 letters from 9. ‚Äì Przemys≈Çaw Scherwentke  Nov 4 '14 at 1:31        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Use the complement rule. $P(\text{at lest one vowel}) = 1 - P(\text{no vowels})$.  You have 6 non-vowels and 3 vowels.  What can you do with this?  The easiest thing to do is to draw a probability tree.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 4 '14 at 1:14       ncmathsadist   40.5k 2 54 95              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .
