Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

I forgot to mention to my doctor about  our travelling plans and zika, but I have never been bitten in Jamaica in the past and I will be well into the middle of the second trimester. I tried calling but no answer from my doctor's office yet.

We stay at jewel and we did not come across any mosquitos on the resort. We did leave the resort to the Dunns River falls, and I don't remember any of us getting bit there. I spoke to my doctor about it and he said I should be fine. Zika cases aren't as high in Jamaica anymore as far as I know. We asked a rep while there and she told us there more localized in smaller communities but things could've changed since then. Make sure you pack lots of bug spray or you can buy wristband that have a repellent on them. ☺️ Hope you have an awesome trip !

Check the CDC website for travel advisories and call motherrisk.org to confirm. Many airlines will refund your money if you booked before you were pregnant. Better to be safe than sorry, but that's my opinion.    Reply    Like  6        •••    Report this                  DanielleJ2017   08/03/17      Defiantly a possibility with Zika.

My mil found out through the CDC that pregnant women should NOT travel south because of the Zika virus. I was in my first trimester when she told us this so going south to visit them is a no go.

My hubby and I have decided no travel to southern areas until we're done having babies. Zika can remain in your system for up to 6 months, including semen, and their still not even sure about it. We decided the risk it not worth it.  Your travel insurance might cover the cancellation if you found out about your pregnancy after the booking.

I wouldn't worry as it isn't really mosquito season in the Caribbean (aug-oct as it is their rain season). As long as you stay out of the bush and stick to the beach and populated areas you should be fine. Still consult with your doc to be safe!

Tfdelozier  10/11/17    My sister is getting married in Jamaica on New Year's Eve, which I was suppose to be going to until I found out I was pregnant. After researching Zika and talking to my doctor I've decided that I can not make the trip and  i'm devastated about the decision.  Since than I've heard so many people say that they have never seen  mosquitoes while stayin at a resort in Jamaica and Zika isn't a big risk there anymore. Also the sandals resort says they take extra measures to prevent mosquitoes and bomb the resort regularly ...  So my question is has any mama's on here traveled to Jamaica while pregnant? What was your  experience  like because of the risk of Zika? How did you make the trip possible? I feel like if I did go I would be worried sick the whole time and it wouldn't be worth it because of the risk but on the other hand it's my sisters wedding and I feel terrible I have to miss it. Thanks for all your help!

There are far more chemicals in Canada I'd be worried about during pregnancy but anyways that's a different story. If you're happy with your decision then you shouldn't let anyone tell you otherwise :)    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               KimPossible10   10/11/17      This article may be worth a read.  It explains the risks to the baby during each trimester of pregnancy.  It might help you make your decisions.  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/06/08/zika-risk-for-birth-defects-drops-for-each-trimester-cdc-finds/    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               YOUANDMEPLUS3   10/11/17      My husband is taking our 3 kids to Mexico in January.  I'm not going.

The doctors there were not conceded the slightest. Apparently zika is very rare and even if contracted there's no evidence it actually causes birth defects. The pics of babies you see on google have other issues going on. Think of all the mothers in the Caribbean who have beautiful healthy baby's and have lived there for 9 months +    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               Expectingfirst1   10/11/17      I am in Jamaica right now for my sisters wedding. Haven’t seen a mosquito yet, but am wearing bug spray everyday. Honestly, I’m more worried about something else happening and not having a hospital that I’m familiar with to go to. But I have my chart and they speak English here. Also, I had a doctor before I got switched to a midwife-the doctor wasn’t concerned, and 2 different midwives that I have seen didn’t have any concerns or tell me to cancel my trip. Just told me to have fun and seemed more concerned about going in the hot tubs and drinking clean water on the resort than they were about Zika    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               Soitbegins   11/11/17      At work we are still screening individuals for Zika..so although it's not in the media as much it is still an ongoing issue. Not everyone has a good understanding of it, and may not be able to provide you with correct information.  However,  you do have the weigh the risks and benefits. People in Jamaica have healthy babies. Maybe look at when Jamaica has its mosquito season (rainy weather) and perhaps look at incidences of Zika in that area.  Canada is at risk for West Nile from May to Nov,  but only certain pockets had outbreaks this year. Additionally all of the US is considered at risk for Zika, but I wouldn't be concerned travelling to NYC.

And last week through HPT I found out I am pregnant. We really weren't planning. I did tell my doctor, and we ordered zika virus blood test, but results will come in only in 2 weeks! such a long wait, and it is driving me crazy. Have anyone gone through something similar?

I would guess the chances that you were infected with Zika would be quite low, even though you were bitten by mosquitoes.

We were getting married in Mexico last year, and there were concerns too. From all the reading I have done, I have concluded that zika has been un-necessary hyped by big pharma and high number of birth defects was associated in areas that use a particular pesticide for mosquitoes (mostly Brazil). There has been a very extensive study done in Puerto Rico for over 10 000 pregnant women who had CONFIRMED zika and actual symptoms of the virus and ALL of them had healthy babies.

There has been a very extensive study done in Puerto Rico for over 10 000 pregnant women who had CONFIRMED zika and actual symptoms of the virus and ALL of them had healthy babies.      Thank you. This does help to put the mind at ease! :)    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               simplymedez   22/09/17      Hun trust me you don't have zika neither does the baby you would have known by now without the tests my girls and I were down there and my little one got bit so many times it was ridiculous and nothing!  You're fine!

Generally my OB wasn't really concerned with Zika virus, and only gave me the requisition form after I have asked. The results came back negative! :D Although, to get the requisition in a first place you must meet a number of criteria. And if you aren't already pregnant within half a year of visiting countries with Zika virus you won't qualify for the test.

I still really want to go on my trip.  I plan on staying closer to the resort, wearing bug spray and avoiding places or activities that would typically attract a lot of mosquitoes.  I guess I'm looking for support from other mama's.  Please, if you just want to post how I should feel badly for choosing any risk to my child do not post.  I work with mom's everyday who choose to intentionally put their children at a variety of risks far greater than a mosquito and I support them.  Just looking for some support myself.

While the risk is relatively small, they still can't clearly quantify that risk. I cancelled my trip to Jamaica before there was local transmission based on the research that I do,  not media. I just felt it wasn't worth the risk as if something happened I would hate myself.  Do some research for yourself but here are some facts I found that helped me make my decision: - first case of Zika in Brazil was only May 2015. - between October 2015 and January 2016 there were 3700 cases of microcephaly whereas less than 200 previous years - in the hardest hit part of Brazil it is 1 in 100 babies being born with microcephaly whereas 1 in 1000 in all of Brazil - There are 20 million people in Brazil and at least a million cases since May 2015 however now they think it's a lot more as less than 1 in 5 show symptoms (even mom's with no symptoms have infected fetus) - there are multiple cases under 20 weeks of fetus' getting microcephaly however I haven't heard of any definite over 20 weeks there could be a risk  My concern was really how quickly it spread there and since so many people don't have symtpoms or have mild flu like symtpoms that the risk is greater than we know    Reply    Like  8        •••    Report this               VTC9   04/02/16      Also I should mention my hubby still went to Jamaica (Negril/ West more Parish) and didn't see too many mosquitos where we were but still a few. They seem to have better mosquito control than some other countries in the Caribbean    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               Annadickson   04/02/16      I went to Mexico in January. I wore bug spray all the time and we hardly saw any Mosquitos anyway. I didn't get any bites. We were near Cancun at a resort right on the beach. There was quite a breeze coming off of the ocean. Also our resort sprayed for Mosquitos. I think if you're staying away from inland wooded areas you'll be fine. Also, from my understanding, the risk to your baby drops significantly after the first trimester since the baby's skull is mostly formed. We spoke to our obstetrician friend and my doctor before going. We had a lovely relaxing time. I will also have two under two when this one is born. :)    Reply    Like  2        •••    Report this                  TeaganD   04/02/16      I strongly urge you to look at actual statistics, and not just the ones they the major news outlets are reporting. Just as one example, cases of microcephaly in Brazil and the "drastic increase" is horrendously misreported. Yes i do believe at this point that it's a media-induced panic, and at this point am keeping my trip booked at the end of March in place.

I was on the island of Yap which had a Zika outbreak already in 2007 (the first outbreak following sporadic cases since the virus appeared in 1947).    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               Leanie1   04/02/16      We cancelled our babymoon and that was without having read anything from the media. I saw someone on here mention it and went straight to foreign affairs/public health agency Canada and CDC. That was enough for me. The amount of internal pressure they would have faced if they were even leaning towards saying something as strong as don't travel... Well, it would have been huge and they wouldn't have made the recommendations if it wasn't warranted. The health agencies have a lot of expertise and I respect what they advise. The other factors for me were just seeing how quickly the virus has been spreading, and knowing that cases are under-reported. For me, this all added up to an easy decision to cancel and book something else. We have two busy preschoolers, so we seem to be pretty happy just getting away anywhere on our own for a break! Anyway, that's just how I weighed it, not me in any way telling you you should feel badly!

I will point out that we were quite north in Mexico (Mazatlan, on the north west coast) but if we were going somewhere much more south we may have been more hesitant. If you're looking for a good all-natural bug spray I found an awesome one at Sage Wellness which is made with essential oils and the main ingredient is catnip! It works very well and you don't smell like chemicals.    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               tdkobo   04/02/16      We just cancelled our trip to Costa Rica after MUCH debate.

Don't let Zika guard down   Monday, July 03, 2017             Tweet                    WASHINGTON, USA (AP) — The Zika virus may not seem as big a threat as last summer but don't let your guard down — especially if you're pregnant or trying to be.  While cases of the birth defect-causing virus have dropped sharply from last year's peak in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, Zika hasn't disappeared from the region and remains a potential threat.  It's hard to predict how much risk people face in locales with smouldering infection, or if cases might spike again. For now, pregnant women still are being urged not to travel to a country or area with even a few reported cases of Zika, because the consequences can be disastrous for a foetus' brain .  “It's part of the new reality,” said Dr Martin Cetron of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Those trying to conceive, and their partners, are advised to check with their doctor on how long to wait after visiting a location with active Zika infection.  There are lingering questions, too, about Zika's risk beyond pregnancy, enough that US scientists just began studying babies in Guatemala to learn if infection after birth also might damage the brain.  The challenge is getting those messages to the people who most need it when Zika is fast receding from the public's radar — even as money may be drying up to track the virus and the babies it injures.     In the past month, Puerto Rico and Brazil, hard hit by Zika last year, declared their epidemics over. But smaller numbers of infections continue around the region, according to the CDC and the Pan American Health Organization.  “Zika hasn't gone away,” said CDC Acting Director Dr Anne Schuchat. “We can't afford to be complacent.”  The US Zika Pregnancy Registry counts 1,963 pregnant women in US states who had lab tests showing Zika infection since officials began counting in 2016, and another 4,107 in US territories.  Since the beginning of June, 271 pregnant women were added to the registry's Zika count, 80 of them in US states and the rest residents of US territories, although it's not clear when they became infected.  What about nonpregnant travellers? CDC has counted 140 cases so far this year in US states, all of them who had symptoms. The vast majority of people who get Zika don't notice symptoms, yet still are potential spreaders of infection if mosquitoes back home bite them and then someone else. That happened late last year in parts of South Florida and Texas, and local health officials remain on alert in case it happens again.  There is no treatment for Zika.  Babies born to Zika-infected mothers can experience severe, brain-related defects, even if mom had no symptoms. Abnormally small heads, called microcephaly, are the most attention-getting defect. Babies also may have hearing or vision loss, seizures, trouble swallowing, or restricted limb movement. Zika infection also can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth.  What's the risk? About one in 20 women with Zika so far have had babies with birth defects in US territories, according to the latest pregnancy registry data. Risk was higher if mom was infected during the first trimester, but even third trimester infections have sometimes led to birth defects.  Another scary issue: Some babies appear fine at birth, only to develop health problems later on. What if Zika can harm a newborn's still-developing brain like it does a foetal brain? After all, one way Zika does its damage is by attacking developing brain cells called neural progenitor cells, and babies retain many of those cells for months after birth.  To find out, the National Institutes of Health(NIH) just funded a new study in Guatemala, where Zika still is spreading, to track the health of 500 newborns and 700 other children ages one to five.  “Our concern is that a developing brain in early life can be impacted significantly,” Dr Flor Munoz of Baylor College of Medicine, who will help lead the study, said in a statement. “It's an important question to address not just for children that live in the endemic areas, but also for children who travel to these areas.”  Back in the US, public health advocates worry that US$1.1 billion Congress approved last year to study and fight Zika is running out — including funding for a birth defects surveillance program intended to monitor affected babies' development and connect them to health services.  That surveillance is critical for knowing what's going on, said Dr Oscar Alleyne of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “Otherwise, we're flying blind.”  The NIH recently began the first large test of a potential vaccine, a study that aims to enrol 2,400 people in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and five Zika-prone countries. There are no signs of safety problems, but if Zika infections remain at low levels, it's likely to take more than one summer of shots to prove if the vaccine really protects.  This kind of virus “almost certainly is not going to disappear completely,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently told Congress.

I know you are supposed to wait 6 months to conceive if your partner has been there. Has anyone conceived after a trip there or to any other Zika countries? He was very diligent with putting on bug spray, and didn't notice any bites (not to say he didn't get one or two). I'm only 6.5 weeks along and my OB doesn't see women until 11 weeks. Is or something I should press about being seen? I've been trying to call the office for a straight week, every day all day with no response. (Maybe also time to switch OBs??) Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  25 Posts m  miraclemommyx3 At this point, what's done is done, but you should use condoms when having sex until you're both tested since the virus can be passed through sex. 11 weeks is crazy though, and personally, I'd be worried about having an OB that I can't get in contact with in case of an emergency. Reply  Close k  kelseyoliver88 My hubby and I made a baby a month after returning from the Caribbean. You should go to your primary doctor so they can start the process. They'll take your blood and send it off somewhere to be tested for Zika. You DO NOT need to call the CDC or do any work. Your primary doctor can do it for you. They know what to do and where to send your blood sample. Or wait until you go to your obgyn. They will NOT want to see you sooner from my experience. You'll have to wait just like any normal pregnancy. Reply  Close k  kelseyoliver88 And yes use condoms for sexy time from now on. Reply  Close w  winenot Anyone know how long they can do blood work for after a trip? My husband and I conceived four months after a trip to the Caribbean. Now it's been five months since our trip. I'm assuming that we have to wait until our 20 week scan now as it's too late for blood work but I don't see my midwife until 8 weeks (two more weeks).  I hate how it's such differing advice. I heard that if no symptoms than four months was long enough to wait. Ugh. Reply  Close t  thirdbabesacharm @winenot  I'm in the same boat as you! Conceived 4 months after a trip to the Caribbean. My husband and I both dont remember getting any bites let alone seeing any bugs. I saw my OB soon after who said four months is probably sufficient if you didnt get bit but the CDC recommends 6 months. We conceived exactly four months after our trip (by surprise) but am still going to ask to get tested on Thursday at my appt. Reply  Close J  Jillybean59226 There's no benefit to going in early......unfortunately there is no treatment for the zika virus. They will test you and confirm if your infected and talk about your risk, that's about it right now. You and baby would be monitored throughout your pregnancy.....not all babies in are effected negatively by the virus.....there are so many variables, they're still trying to figure it all out.... They recommend getting tested within 12 weeks, so you'll still be within that timeline.... If your hubby wore bug spray and didn't receive very many bites, it's unlikely he was infected......your chances of contracting the virus are based on length of exposure and how many bites you received. I know it's hard.....but try and relax some :) Reply  Close k  kelseyoliver88 @winenot  I think they only test after 12 weeks. So I think you missed that opportunity to check. Reply  Close C  ChaChaDipper Hey! I'm going through this too. Got back from a week long mission trip in Honduras (my husband didn't go) and went in a week after getting back to get tested just to be safe before we started trying. They told me to just wait 8 weeks because the test results can take 4 to 8 weeks to return, also to not get tested bc I wasn't symptomatic and I was not pregnant. We planned to wait but unexpectedly got pregnant that June (I am 5 weeks pregnant). The time frame to get tested is 2 - 12 weeks after exposure. Since I am pregnant the state approved me for testing. I gave blood and urine one week ago today. Basically, the OB said it was up to me to be tested and that I would have to navigate that process by speaking with the health dept. So I called our local health dept., the lady gathered my info and called the state to see if I am allowed to take the test, she called me back to say that I am and then she needed my family doctor's name and she contacted him and he spent a day gathering all the paperwork (there is a lot for them to do, I did hardly any). Once he got the papers to the health dept. then I the labs were ordered. This whole process took two days. Sorry for the run on sentence lol. Anyways, I don't remember getting bit either but of course wanted to get checked so I am not so concerned at each US regarding growth. I recently read an article saying there have been so many false positives here in the US that the CDC is considering scaling back on testing in some capacity due to the concern that ensues when folks receive a positive that they later learn is false. I hope that is of comfort. I just run to my God and pray because the waiting is hard and He is my anchor. Please keep us posted and let me know if you'd like to email. Have you checked out the zika discussion board? Reply  Close d  duhlenberg We had our honeymoon at the Mayan Rivera may 1st and conceived June 14th. We kept a lot of bug spray on and even though I wasn't too concerned I still wanted to get checked but my doctor said you have to be pregnant AND have symptoms. So when I went back I said that I'm pregnant and was a bit sick when I got home and so I received the test and it was negative. Nice piece of mind but I know quite a few people who have conceived on their trip or shortly after throughout the years and I've never heard of anyone having the Zika virus so if say try not to worry too much as stressing could be worse for the baby. Reply  Close C  Chemiss I live in Jamaica. Not much of a threat here anymore. I haven't even heard anyone mentioning ZIKA since sometime last year. Reply  Close L  Lauramm1919 My husband and I were both in Ecuador in March. My first appointment with the obgyn nurse she asked those questions, then called the CDC who confirmed I needed a blood test. It was negative but it is good they are being so vigilant. From what I understand, and I know adults who had Zika, it's flu like symptoms for a couple weeks. It's an over abundance of caution but it's necessary. Call your obgyn office and tell them you were out of the country to a Zika region. They will order a blood test. Good luck. Reply  Close m  maylove_90021790 My partner visited Guadalajara, Mexico in late May we conceived early June...he went back for a family ordeal in July basically the doctor suggested we use condoms for the rest of our pregnancy, since I didn't travel they aren't testing me for Zika, they are waiting till around 16 or 20 weeks to measure the babies head to see if it's growing properly.  Reply  Close E  Efree0520 I had to be tested too and my doctors office told me they only gave until 12 weeks after travel to send in the blood work. After that, they will wait until your 20 week US and take head measurements. Reply  Close m  mambiann30 the Zika virus is NOT a threat in JAMAICA.... Reply  Close M  Megnolia I'm in the exact same situation.... we were in Jamaica in June (9-17) and about 3 weeks later my husband and I conceived... it wasn't planned, we were actually using precautions due to the fact that we were just in the Caribbean but we are pregnant - miracles happen! It's our first, I'm so happy and excited as we really wanted to start trying soon but had planned to wait. We are nervous due to the scare of Zika virus but we were also careful and got maybe 2 mosquito bites between us. According to my calculations I'm about 5.5 weeks pregnant now. I have my first doctors appointment this Friday.... I'll keep you posted as to what they say. Good luck!!! Reply  Close m  mambiann30 the Zika virus is NOT a threat in JAMAICA....

Extremely rare, with fewer than 1,000 U.S. cases per year, the symptoms range from fever to range to joint pain to red eyes. However, in recent times, the World Health Organization has declared the Zika virus as a global public health emergency with more and more cases popping up in America.    The most recent victim? Chrissy Rutherford. A New York-based, 30-year-old senior digital editor for Harper’s Bazaar didn’t think her trip to Kingston, Jamaica would leave her with weird muscle pain” in her legs or “a charley horse pain” in her left thigh. She didn’t immediately link the pain to Zika virus, but when a lump formed behind her ear and a rash broke out on her face, she knew something had gone array.  “[Zika] definitely had not crossed my mind until I started breaking out in a rash… That’s when I was like ‘Okay, there’s definitely something wrong with me,’ ” Rutherford told PEOPLE . “I was feeling really tired. I had plans to go out with a friend, but I had to cancel on her. I told her it’s hard to explain what’s going on with my body… I have no idea.”  Photo Credit: COURTESY CHRISSY RUTHERFORD  Rutherford first came to the assumption that she might have Zika during a train ride to a wedding in Westchester, New York. She wrote an op-ed for Harper’s Bazaar , explaining that while taking a selfie she noticed her skin looked “unusually bumpy.” “I was like ‘Oh my God, there’s really something wrong with me,’ ” she says. “I don’t ever get rashes.” When she approached her friends about the idea, it was met with laughter from friends who told her “not to be ridiculous!”    After, Rutherford’s mother who is also a nurse, advised her to drink lots of water and get tested for Zika. “When I was [in Jamaica], I was like, ‘What are the chances I would actually get [Zika],’ ” she said. “I had put bug spray on once or twice, but I wasn’t super vigilant about it, and I didn’t put any on during the daytime.”  She then immediate sought out medical attention, where they did a blood test and took samples of her urine. “I spent a lot of that time reading information on the Internet. I was home and in bed for days. I was pretty certain that [Zika] was what I had,” Rutherford recalls.  A week later, the doctors confirmed that she had tested positive for Zika. “In a way, I felt like, ‘Oh, okay, I wasn’t crazy!’ ” I did have this even though some of my friends thought it was something else,” she said. “I wasn’t too worried, because I’m not planning on having a baby anytime soon, so I know that the effects are a lot less scary for me.”        🍹 #jamaica #kingston #hellshire  A post shared by Chrissy Rutherford (@chrissyford) on May 31, 2016 at 11:09am PDT    Rutherford’s symptoms have since receded and she has returned to work.  “They say it only stays in your system for up to a week, so I technically don’t have it anymore,” she says. “It does suck and you feel terrible for a couple of days, but I think you just have to ride it out.    “It’s very frightening for those who are trying to get pregnant,” she also explained. “There needs to be more education about what is going on.”  For those that are traveling out of the United States, Rutherford advises all to “read up” on the Zika virus.  “Everyone really needs to understand what [Zika] is,” said. “That’s all you can do is really wear bug spray and make sure you are wearing the right one that can protect you from the mosquitoes that spread the virus. I think it’s important to be informed.  Share this: Twitter Facebook Google Like this: Like  Loading...

Take meticulous anti-mosquito bite measures during the daytime. Pregnant travellers should postpone travel to this country. Description  Zika Virus infection is caused by the Zika Virus (ZIKV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The virus is primarily transmitted by infected daytime biting female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which are typically active from dawn to dusk. There is evidence that Zika Virus is also transmitted by other mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus. The virus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Human transmission can also occur through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. In some patients, researchers have found that the virus can be shed through saliva and urine. Risk Zika Virus is present in Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, tropical areas of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and parts of Africa. All travellers are at risk. Long-term travellers and aid or missionary workers going to areas where Zika Virus is endemic are at greater risk. Information about the virus is continuously evolving. However, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika Virus causes neurological complications: Guillain-Barré syndrome (progressive muscle weakness that can lead to temporary paralysis) and microcephaly (decreased head size which may lead to developmental delays) in infants born to pregnant women infected with the virus. Symptoms In the majority of cases, Zika Virus infection is asymptomatic – persons do not exhibit symptoms. Those with symptoms usually get ill 3-12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms include mild fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and general malaise. The illness is characterized by pink eye (inflammation of the conjunctiva), a skin rash with red spots on the face, neck, trunk, and upper arms which can spread to the palms or soles, and sensitivity to light. Some may also have a lack of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and dizziness. Most people fully recover from the illness within 7 days. Treatment includes supportive care of symptoms. There is no antiviral treatment available. The Zika Virus is related to Dengue , Yellow Fever , West Nile Virus , and Japanese Encephalitis . It may be misdiagnosed for Dengue and Chikungunya . Prevention Travellers going to areas with Zika Virus should take meticulous measures to prevent mosquito bites during the daytime. There is currently no preventive medication or vaccine against Zika Virus.  Use a repellent containing 20%-30% DEET or 20% Picaridin on exposed skin. Re-apply according to manufacturer's directions.  Wear neutral-coloured (beige, light grey) clothing. If possible, wear long-sleeved, breathable garments.  If available, pre-soak or spray outer layer clothing and gear with permethrin.  Get rid of water containers around dwellings and ensure that door and window screens work properly.  Apply sunscreen first followed by the repellent (preferably 20 minutes later).  More details on insect bite prevention .     Pregnancy and Zika Virus  Travellers who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should postpone travel to areas with Zika Virus transmission.  To avoid sexual transmission of the virus to a pregnant partner , travellers who have been in areas with risk of Zika Virus transmission should practice safe sex for the duration of the pregnancy.  All travellers, particularly partners considering pregnancy , should practice safe sex or abstinence for at least 6 months if one or both partners have travelled to an area with risk of Zika Virus transmission. Practicing safe sex is recommended even if you or your partner do not have symptoms. Most Zika Virus infections are asymptomatic (show no signs or symptoms), but transmission of the virus to another person can still occur.  If you travel to or live in an area with risk of Zika virus transmission, follow meticulous mosquito bite prevention measures during the daytime.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She added, “We’ve become more concerned” about the period around the time of conception. “For people who either have the Zika disease or who travel to an area with active Zika transmission, we are now recommending they wait a period of time before trying to get pregnant.”     Zika Virus Rumors and Theories That You Should Doubt  Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.             For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

Bermuda has seen double-digit growth in the number of visitors under 45.     By Christopher Muther  Globe Staff  October 26, 2016        HAMILTON, Bermuda — This island has always been a popular port for cruise ships depositing families and baby boomers in the pink sand of Horseshoe Bay beach. But there’s a new, rapidly growing demographic arriving in Bermuda — young couples hoping to avoid Zika. Over the past nine months, Bermuda has seen double digit growth in the number of visitors under the age of 45. Tourism officials on the island are hesitant to attribute the increase entirely to those seeking romantic, Zika-free beaches, but the rise comes at a time when Caribbean islands are getting hit by cancellations and vacationers are looking for alternate destinations that are free of the mosquito-spread disease. “The island does not have the mosquito that carries the virus,” said Victoria Isley, chief sales and marketing officer for the Bermuda Tourism Authority. “This has made Bermuda a safe option for young mothers or young mothers-to-be and couples.”   Advertisement     Zika is primarily carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The virus causes flulike symptoms in most people, but is especially devastating for pregnant women because it can cause the birth defect microcephaly and other neurological deficits. It can also cause miscarriages and stillborn births. The CDC advises that women who are pregnant, or women considering children in the near future, avoid nonessential travel to areas where Zika has been reported.

No, not at all,” Isley said. “We hope our appeal as a destination is more than that.”  The increase in visitors to Bermuda is strongest among 25- to 34-year-olds. This coincides with the average age when couples marry and start families (29 for men, 27 for women, according to the US Census Bureau). From January to September 2016, the number of 25- to 34-year-old visitors increased by nearly 33 percent, from, 17,000 to 22,500 over the previous year. The second largest bump was travelers between 18 and 24, with an increase of more than 20 percent. Bermuda may be Zika-free, but its coordinates (it’s just 570 miles off the coast of North Carolina) puts it at a temperate disadvantage to the Caribbean. The average high temperature is 68 degrees in February. The average high temperature the same month in Puerto Rico is 84. For sun worshipers, the mid-80s sounds much more appealing for a day at the beach.   Christopher Muther/Globe staff  A colorful, historic home on Duke of York Street in St. George’s, Bermuda.   Still, for those considering starting a family or for couples on a babymoon, a few degrees may not outweigh safety concerns.   Advertisement     “Bookings to the Caribbean and Mexico are taking a beating,” said Jack Ezon, president of Ovation Vacations in New York. Ezon said a quarter of his clients who have normally booked their winter travel by now have yet to book. About 30 percent of his clients who usually take family vacations in the Caribbean, Mexico, or Florida have shifted their destination to Arizona, California, or Hawaii. Bermuda bookings are most popular from May to September. Bermuda’s lack of locally transmitted Zika is not the result of some cosmic lucky break. The government of the British territory has been actively monitoring its mosquito population and taking precautions for decades. As a result, the country has never experienced outbreaks of dengue fever, chikungunya, or Zika. Bermuda hasn’t staved off these mosquito-borne diseases by fogging and spraying neighborhoods with pesticides. The most effective weapon in Bermuda’s mosquito war? Six hundred simple glass jars. “It may not look like much,” said David Kendell, director of Bermuda’s Department of Health. “But it is incredibly effective.”   Advertisement     The glass jar is dark and filled with plain water, replicating the wet, shady places where female mosquitoes commonly lay their eggs. A textured stick in the jar is the perfect place for the mosquito to deposit the eggs. Workers then fan out over the island each week to check the 600 egg trap jars. The eggs and any hatched larvae found in the water are killed, or brought to a lab and studied. “We don’t wait for the eggs to hatch,” Kendell said. “We have a higher density of egg traps than any other country. We take surveillance seriously. Anywhere you are in Bermuda, you’re probably within 1,000 feet of an egg trap. We have good intel on these mosquitoes.” The mosquitoes that are found in Bermuda are commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito. The Asian tiger mosquito arrived in the US about 30 years ago. They are less effective at carrying diseases than the Aedes aegypti mosquito and therefore seen as less of a Zika threat. The Aedes aegypti, which hasn’t been seen in Bermuda for about a decade, but has been reported in Florida, is responsible for the current Zika outbreak. The absence of Aedes aegypti hasn’t stopped Bermuda’s Department of Public Health from keeping close tabs on the situation. In addition to the 600 egg trap jars, there is a team of 20 workers who can enter private property to enforce what Kendell calls “mosquito laws.” These federal employees check lawns for everyday objects that collect standing water, such as tires, bird baths, watering cans, pet dishes, and potted plants. Employees are allowed issue citations if homeowners don’t address the standing water. They can even prosecute if necessary.   Christopher Muther/Globe staff  Tobacco Beach in Bermuda.   Not only has Bermuda helped advise Caribbean countries on control efforts, it has also become a live laboratory for students at Clark University in Worcester, who visit the island biennially to conduct research experiments and study the island’s mosquito population. “We’ve benefited a lot from the setting,” said Clark professor Todd Livdahl. “We’ve helped them study the two types of mosquitoes, but they already have a smart, aggressive approach. ” Kendell employs the lexicon of a general when he talks about Bermuda’s “strategic strikes,” and “reconnaissance missions” against the insects. “We tend to think we’re always at war with mosquitoes,” he said. “This year it’s Zika, next year it’s something else. The trick is to always stay one step ahead of the enemy.” Christopher Muther can be reached at muther@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @Chris_Muther . Follow him on Instagram @Chris_Muther .

Figures from the health ministry seen by The Sunday Gleaner show that from the notifications, 7,767, or 77 per cent, were determined to be suspected cases of ZIKV. So far, 203 confirmed cases of the virus have been recorded.  According to Chief Medical Officer in the Ministry of Health Dr Winston De La Haye, the numbers are not causing panic among health-care officials, but underscore the need for alertness and vigilance.  "The numbers you see are from private- and public-sector practitioners, and that's exactly what we want them to do. We do not want them to take any chances. We want them to report the cases so that each one can be carefully assessed so that the necessary actions can be taken," said De La Haye.   Microcephaly in babies  With Zika being linked to microcephaly in babies, De La Haye noted that among the notifications received by the health ministry were 827 pregnant women. That group had 698 suspected cases and 78 confirmed cases.  He said the health professionals were equally vigilant about symptoms for malaria and yellow fever as they were about microcephaly - a rare neurological condition in which an infant's head is significantly smaller than the heads of other children of the same age and sex.  Malaria, yellow fever and Zika all have in common the bite of the infected Aedes aegypti mosquito.  De La Haye said, "There are no cases of ZIKV-related microcephaly in Jamaica," as he sought to quell fears among many persons that babies are born with microcephaly because the mothers were bitten by the infected mosquito.  Congenital syndrome associated with the Zika (CSAZ) virus has seen 50 suspected cases to date, of 170 notifications.  Forty-six of the cases were determined to be microcephaly with 35 non-severe cases, four showing other abnormalities such as 'crooked joints', while 11 cases have shown severe microcephaly.  De La Haye said all the children are currently living with their mothers, but this could change.  "Those children are being monitored and are seen a bit more regularly at the clinics. Continuous assessments are made to determine if those children may need to be kept in homes. But for now they are with the parents."  The monitoring is done because children with microcephaly often have developmental issues, and with no treatment for the abnormality, early intervention with supportive therapies, such as speech and occupational therapies, may help improve quality of life, he said.  Meanwhile, there are 166 cases of notified cases of babies with Zika neurological complications. Of that number, 37 are suspected cases, 30 fit the Brigton criteria (specific measurement criteria); seven the Guillain-BarrÈ syndrome (GBS) variant, and four Zika-positive.  Of the total numbers presented, the health ministry said 77 per cent fit the case definition and were classified as suspected. Of the suspected cases, nine per cent were pregnant women, with less than one per cent being suspected CSAZ.  erica.virtue@gleanerjm.com              «Light on Violence | Wrong medicine - Current prescription to fight crime cannot work, says Gayle Messy marriage  - Government moving to divorce regulatory authority from Bureau of Standards»    View the discussion thread.

Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Jamaica are infected with Zika virus and are spreading it to people.  Because Zika virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes, CDC recommends that travelers to Jamaica protect themselves from mosquito bites (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites) . The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Travelers whose itineraries are limited to areas above this elevation are at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito. The following map shows areas of Jamaica above and below 6,500 feet.* For more information, see Questions and Answers: Zika risk at high elevations (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/q-a-zika-risk-high-elevations) .    Interactive web map: Search for a place by name, or pan, zoom, and click on the map to display additional information.    Elevation Based Recommendations (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/q-a-zika-risk-high-elevations)  High Elevation (above 6,500 ft/2,000 m)  Low Elevation (below 6,500 ft/2,000 m)  The categories shown on this map are intended as general guidelines and should not be considered to indicate absolute risk.*  *Elevation may vary within an area to a larger extent than this map can depict. The presence of mosquitoes may change seasonally, with increasing temperatures or rainfall, and may change over time. Travelers to destinations that cross or are near an elevation border may wish to consider the area as low elevation. Travelers to high elevations are still at risk of getting Zika from sex.     Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:  Should not travel to any area of Jamaica below 6,500 feet (see map).  If you must travel to one of these areas, talk to your doctor first and strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites) during your trip. If your itinerary is limited entirely to areas above 6,500 feet, there is minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito.  Because Zika can also be spread by sex, if you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Jamaica, either use condoms or do not have sex ( vaginal, anal, or oral ) or share sex toys during your pregnancy.    Women who are trying to become pregnant:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  See CDC guidance for how long you should wait to get pregnant after travel to Jamaica.    You and your partner should strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites) .    If you have traveled to Jamaica and have a pregnant partner, use condoms or don’t have sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) or share sex toys during the pregnancy.      Sexual transmission of Zika virus is also possible, so you should use condoms or not have sex during your trip.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick. Among those who do develop symptoms, sickness is usually mild, with symptoms that last for several days to a week. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis for a few weeks to several months. CDC research suggests that GBS is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS. Most people fully recover from GBS, but some have permanent damage. For more information, see Zika and GBS .  As more information becomes available, this travel notice will be updated. Please check back frequently for the most up-to-date recommendations.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  There is no vaccine or medicine for Zika. You can protect yourself by preventing mosquito bites: (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites)   Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.  Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), IR3535, or 2-undecanone (methyl nonyl ketone). Always use as directed.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.  Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)    Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.  Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.  Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.  Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.   Because Zika can be spread by sex, if you have sex ( vaginal, anal, or oral ) while traveling, you should use condoms.  After travel:  Many people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person’s blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. If you travel to Jamaica, you should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks after your trip, even if you don’t feel sick, so that you don’t spread Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  If you have visited Jamaica and have a pregnant partner, you should either use condoms or not have sex during the pregnancy.  If you are thinking about pregnancy, talk with your health care provider and wait to become pregnant (see “ Women Trying to Become Pregnant ” for how long to wait). You also should use condoms after travel to protect your sex partners from Zika even if you are not pregnant or trying to become pregnant.  For more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission .  If you feel sick and think you may have Zika:   Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.  Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.  Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.   If you are pregnant:  Talk to a doctor or other health care provider after your trip, even if you don’t feel sick. Pregnant travelers returning from Jamaica, or who have had possible sexual exposure, should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.   If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.  If you do not have symptoms, testing should be offered if you see a health care provider, up to 12 weeks after you return from travel or your last possible sexual exposure.   Clinician Information  All pregnant women should be assessed for Zika virus exposure at each prenatal care visit. Possible exposures to Zika virus that warrant testing include:   Travel to or residence in an area with a current Zika outbreak.  Sex ( vaginal, anal, or oral ) with a partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with a current Zika outbreak.   The type of testing recommended varies according to when a woman’s last possible exposure occurred or when her symptoms began. For more information, please visit the clinical guidance for healthcare providers caring for pregnant women .  Clinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Infants & Children is also available.

It is closely related to other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and there is currently no known vaccine.  For most people Zika presents as a mild infection and is not harmful in the long term.  The real risk is for women who are either pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Zika virus has a strong link with birth defects, the most notable being microcephaly — a condition that affects brain and skull development.  For this reason, pregnant women are advised to avoid or delay traveling to any Zika-affected country.  According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) the Zika virus has spread through most of the Caribbean. The CDC issues alert levels for Zika-affected countries. Many Caribbean countries are currently at alert level 2, and the CDC advises that pregnant women avoid nonessential travel to these places.  Note: country statuses change frequently so it is important to check the most up-to-date travel advisories before you book.  Zika-free travel destinations in the Caribbean  According to the CDC, Zika is not currently present in American Samoa, Guadeloupe,  Martinique and Saint Barthélemy. These lesser-visited destinations might be an ideal alternative for travelers concerned about Zika.  Zika in Aruba  Zika is present in Aruba and is being transmitted to humans via mosquito bites.  The small Dutch-administered island is part of the aptly named ABC island chain, along with Bonaire and Curacao. With its white sand beaches, glorious weather, and luxurious resorts it has long been a popular spot for romantic getaways, honeymoons, and babymoons.      Unfortunately, the island is currently at alert level 2, which means that pregnant women should find a different Caribbean vacation spot that is Zika free.  Zika in the Bahamas  Zika has also been confirmed in the Bahamas.  The Bahamas is a collection of more than 700 islands in the Caribbean Sea that stretch from the North Atlantic to Florida’s east coast. The country has long been a popular maritime playground for sun-seeking visitors and cruise ship passengers.  Like Aruba, the Bahamas is at alert level 2, which means that it is essential that all travelers are extremely careful to avoid or prevent mosquito bites and higher risk groups should avoid all non-essential travel.  Zika in Barbados  Zika is present in Barbados and is being transmitted to people via infected mosquitoes. Barbados is popular for its picture-postcard beaches and opulent resorts. But with a long history and its UNESCO world heritage capital, the island is far more than simply a beach destination.  Despite being another ideal spot for honeymooners and romantic retreats, the island is currently at alert level 2 which means that mosquito bite prevention measures should be carefully observed and pregnant women should look elsewhere for the time being.  Zika in the Dominican Republic  Zika is confirmed to be present in the Dominican Republic.  Unlike its less fortunate neighbor, Haiti, the Dominican Republic has a strong, growing economy and rapidly-improving living standards. The most popular travel destination in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic draws visitors with its fascinating history, lively culture, and spectacular beaches.      As with many of its Caribbean neighbors, the country is currently at Zika alert level 2, which means enhanced precautions and avoiding non-essential travel for higher-risk groups.  Zika in Cuba  Zika is confirmed as present in Cuba, and mosquitos are transmitting the virus to humans. The outbreak comes at a tragic time for the country, as the gradual easing of US travel restrictions had otherwise promised a transformation for the tourism industry.  But the official advice is still that travelers should take enhanced precautions against mosquito bites and that at-risk groups such as pregnant women should avoid Cuba for now.  Zika in Puerto Rico  Zika is confirmed in Puerto Rico. Although the local authorities have declared that the epidemic is over, the island is still listed at alert level 2 by the CDC which means that enhanced mosquito bite precautions should still be practised, pregnant women should avoid visiting, and safe sex should be practised.  Zika in Jamaica  As with most of the Caribbean, Zika is present in Jamaica and is being transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Much of inland Jamaica is relatively mountainous and Zika-carrying mosquitoes are rarely found above 6,500 feet. But most tourists tend to stay in resorts around the coast and are still at risk. As such, the country is listed by the CDC at alert level 2, enhanced precautions are advised, and the current advice for pregnant women is to avoid all travel to Jamaica.  Bonus Zika-free destination: Bermuda  Although not technically in the Caribbean, the island of Bermuda is considered close enough by most visitors and remains free from the Zika-carrying mosquito.  There have been several cases of Zika in Bermuda, but to date, they have all been imported by visitors from elsewhere. Bermuda is a major stop-off point for cruise ships but also a popular travel destination in its own right, combining trademark tropical beaches with a rich and varied cultural heritage. It’s within a two-hour flight from most eastern US hubs, making it a top contender for Zika-free island breaks.  Note that Zika can also be transmitted sexually, so higher-risk groups should remain cautious.  All information was correct at time of publication but travelers should be sure to check the latest CDC Zika advisories before booking.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

We stay at jewel and we did not come across any mosquitos on the resort. We did leave the resort to the Dunns River falls, and I don't remember any of us getting bit there. I spoke to my doctor about it and he said I should be fine. Zika cases aren't as high in Jamaica anymore as far as I know. We asked a rep while there and she told us there more localized in smaller communities but things could've changed since then. Make sure you pack lots of bug spray or you can buy wristband that have a repellent on them. ☺️ Hope you have an awesome trip !

Better to be safe than sorry, but that's my opinion.    Reply    Like  6        •••    Report this                  DanielleJ2017   08/03/17      Defiantly a possibility with Zika.

My mil found out through the CDC that pregnant women should NOT travel south because of the Zika virus. I was in my first trimester when she told us this so going south to visit them is a no go.

My hubby and I have decided no travel to southern areas until we're done having babies. Zika can remain in your system for up to 6 months, including semen, and their still not even sure about it. We decided the risk it not worth it.  Your travel insurance might cover the cancellation if you found out about your pregnancy after the booking.

I wouldn't worry as it isn't really mosquito season in the Caribbean (aug-oct as it is their rain season). As long as you stay out of the bush and stick to the beach and populated areas you should be fine. Still consult with your doc to be safe!

Tfdelozier  10/11/17    My sister is getting married in Jamaica on New Year's Eve, which I was suppose to be going to until I found out I was pregnant. After researching Zika and talking to my doctor I've decided that I can not make the trip and  i'm devastated about the decision.  Since than I've heard so many people say that they have never seen  mosquitoes while stayin at a resort in Jamaica and Zika isn't a big risk there anymore. Also the sandals resort says they take extra measures to prevent mosquitoes and bomb the resort regularly ...  So my question is has any mama's on here traveled to Jamaica while pregnant? What was your  experience  like because of the risk of Zika? How did you make the trip possible? I feel like if I did go I would be worried sick the whole time and it wouldn't be worth it because of the risk but on the other hand it's my sisters wedding and I feel terrible I have to miss it. Thanks for all your help!

I bet there are pregnant ppl who live in Jamaica every day. there are precautions you can take like wearing appropriate clothing etc.. I travel quite a bit and mosquitos are pretty scarce at resorts. like with everything in life there are risks and there is a slight risk for zika. you need to weight the pro's and con's.. talk to your hubby and sister and see if they can help you come to a decision    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this                  Sfbaby1   10/11/17      Watch these videos.

Zika is the least of your worries in JA. It's just if you feel comfortable flying and being far away from home during your pregnancy. There are far more chemicals in Canada I'd be worried about during pregnancy but anyways that's a different story. If you're happy with your decision then you shouldn't let anyone tell you otherwise :)    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               KimPossible10   10/11/17      This article may be worth a read.  It explains the risks to the baby during each trimester of pregnancy.  It might help you make your decisions.  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/06/08/zika-risk-for-birth-defects-drops-for-each-trimester-cdc-finds/    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               YOUANDMEPLUS3   10/11/17      My husband is taking our 3 kids to Mexico in January.  I'm not going.

The doctors there were not conceded the slightest. Apparently zika is very rare and even if contracted there's no evidence it actually causes birth defects. The pics of babies you see on google have other issues going on.

Haven’t seen a mosquito yet, but am wearing bug spray everyday. Honestly, I’m more worried about something else happening and not having a hospital that I’m familiar with to go to. But I have my chart and they speak English here. Also, I had a doctor before I got switched to a midwife-the doctor wasn’t concerned, and 2 different midwives that I have seen didn’t have any concerns or tell me to cancel my trip. Just told me to have fun and seemed more concerned about going in the hot tubs and drinking clean water on the resort than they were about Zika    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               Soitbegins   11/11/17      At work we are still screening individuals for Zika..so although it's not in the media as much it is still an ongoing issue. Not everyone has a good understanding of it, and may not be able to provide you with correct information.  However,  you do have the weigh the risks and benefits. People in Jamaica have healthy babies. Maybe look at when Jamaica has its mosquito season (rainy weather) and perhaps look at incidences of Zika in that area.  Canada is at risk for West Nile from May to Nov,  but only certain pockets had outbreaks this year. Additionally all of the US is considered at risk for Zika, but I wouldn't be concerned travelling to NYC.

I went on a cruise end of summer and I was already pregnant but we never left the ship so we really didn't come into contact with any mosquitoes. All OBs and doctors will recommend against it because the risk is there and no one can garuntee you won't get bit by a zika infected mosquito.

Another couple with us on the cruise got off the ship and got mosquito bites and have decided to wait the 6 months before they start trying to get pregnant. Again it was their personal choice but they weren't comfortable with the unknown of whether or not they carried the virus    Reply    Like  2        •••    Report this               auntnicole   02/11/17      Totally not worth it!

However it is a big risk to take. The resorts usually spray for mosquitos daily but there are still plenty of mosquitos on the beaches and the occasional one on the resort. We're going to Hawaii in 3 weeks because all of the Caribbean has been infected with zika..

And last week through HPT I found out I am pregnant. We really weren't planning. I did tell my doctor, and we ordered zika virus blood test, but results will come in only in 2 weeks! such a long wait, and it is driving me crazy. Have anyone gone through something similar?

I'm sure all will be well! I know that doesn't help much. Keep taking your prenatal vitamins and try not to stress too much. A level 2 isn't as bad as other places with the virus. From my understanding zika is getting less "powerful"    Reply    Like  4        •••    Report this               umdelisl   18/09/17      I know the wait is going to be difficult, but there is nothing you can do to change the outcome, so try to relax and allow yourself to enjoy your pregnancy. I would guess the chances that you were infected with Zika would be quite low, even though you were bitten by mosquitoes.    Reply    Like  1        •••    Report this               yulik21   19/09/17      I also recommend you not to stress about it too much. Besides, you can't change the outcome. We were getting married in Mexico last year, and there were concerns too. From all the reading I have done, I have concluded that zika has been un-necessary hyped by big pharma and high number of birth defects was associated in areas that use a particular pesticide for mosquitoes (mostly Brazil). There has been a very extensive study done in Puerto Rico for over 10 000 pregnant women who had CONFIRMED zika and actual symptoms of the virus and ALL of them had healthy babies.

Generally my OB wasn't really concerned with Zika virus, and only gave me the requisition form after I have asked. The results came back negative! :D Although, to get the requisition in a first place you must meet a number of criteria.

I still really want to go on my trip.  I plan on staying closer to the resort, wearing bug spray and avoiding places or activities that would typically attract a lot of mosquitoes.  I guess I'm looking for support from other mama's.  Please, if you just want to post how I should feel badly for choosing any risk to my child do not post.  I work with mom's everyday who choose to intentionally put their children at a variety of risks far greater than a mosquito and I support them.  Just looking for some support myself.

While the risk is relatively small, they still can't clearly quantify that risk. I cancelled my trip to Jamaica before there was local transmission based on the research that I do,  not media. I just felt it wasn't worth the risk as if something happened I would hate myself.  Do some research for yourself but here are some facts I found that helped me make my decision: - first case of Zika in Brazil was only May 2015. - between October 2015 and January 2016 there were 3700 cases of microcephaly whereas less than 200 previous years - in the hardest hit part of Brazil it is 1 in 100 babies being born with microcephaly whereas 1 in 1000 in all of Brazil - There are 20 million people in Brazil and at least a million cases since May 2015 however now they think it's a lot more as less than 1 in 5 show symptoms (even mom's with no symptoms have infected fetus) - there are multiple cases under 20 weeks of fetus' getting microcephaly however I haven't heard of any definite over 20 weeks there could be a risk  My concern was really how quickly it spread there and since so many people don't have symtpoms or have mild flu like symtpoms that the risk is greater than we know    Reply    Like  8        •••    Report this               VTC9   04/02/16      Also I should mention my hubby still went to Jamaica (Negril/ West more Parish) and didn't see too many mosquitos where we were but still a few. They seem to have better mosquito control than some other countries in the Caribbean    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               Annadickson   04/02/16      I went to Mexico in January. I wore bug spray all the time and we hardly saw any Mosquitos anyway. I didn't get any bites. We were near Cancun at a resort right on the beach. There was quite a breeze coming off of the ocean. Also our resort sprayed for Mosquitos. I think if you're staying away from inland wooded areas you'll be fine. Also, from my understanding, the risk to your baby drops significantly after the first trimester since the baby's skull is mostly formed. We spoke to our obstetrician friend and my doctor before going. We had a lovely relaxing time. I will also have two under two when this one is born. :)    Reply    Like  2        •••    Report this                  TeaganD   04/02/16      I strongly urge you to look at actual statistics, and not just the ones they the major news outlets are reporting. Just as one example, cases of microcephaly in Brazil and the "drastic increase" is horrendously misreported. Yes i do believe at this point that it's a media-induced panic, and at this point am keeping my trip booked at the end of March in place.

I was on the island of Yap which had a Zika outbreak already in 2007 (the first outbreak following sporadic cases since the virus appeared in 1947).    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               Leanie1   04/02/16      We cancelled our babymoon and that was without having read anything from the media. I saw someone on here mention it and went straight to foreign affairs/public health agency Canada and CDC. That was enough for me. The amount of internal pressure they would have faced if they were even leaning towards saying something as strong as don't travel... Well, it would have been huge and they wouldn't have made the recommendations if it wasn't warranted. The health agencies have a lot of expertise and I respect what they advise. The other factors for me were just seeing how quickly the virus has been spreading, and knowing that cases are under-reported. For me, this all added up to an easy decision to cancel and book something else. We have two busy preschoolers, so we seem to be pretty happy just getting away anywhere on our own for a break! Anyway, that's just how I weighed it, not me in any way telling you you should feel badly!

I will point out that we were quite north in Mexico (Mazatlan, on the north west coast) but if we were going somewhere much more south we may have been more hesitant. If you're looking for a good all-natural bug spray I found an awesome one at Sage Wellness which is made with essential oils and the main ingredient is catnip! It works very well and you don't smell like chemicals.    Reply    Like  0        •••    Report this               tdkobo   04/02/16      We just cancelled our trip to Costa Rica after MUCH debate.

Don't let Zika guard down   Monday, July 03, 2017             Tweet                    WASHINGTON, USA (AP) — The Zika virus may not seem as big a threat as last summer but don't let your guard down — especially if you're pregnant or trying to be.  While cases of the birth defect-causing virus have dropped sharply from last year's peak in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, Zika hasn't disappeared from the region and remains a potential threat.  It's hard to predict how much risk people face in locales with smouldering infection, or if cases might spike again. For now, pregnant women still are being urged not to travel to a country or area with even a few reported cases of Zika, because the consequences can be disastrous for a foetus' brain .  “It's part of the new reality,” said Dr Martin Cetron of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Those trying to conceive, and their partners, are advised to check with their doctor on how long to wait after visiting a location with active Zika infection.  There are lingering questions, too, about Zika's risk beyond pregnancy, enough that US scientists just began studying babies in Guatemala to learn if infection after birth also might damage the brain.  The challenge is getting those messages to the people who most need it when Zika is fast receding from the public's radar — even as money may be drying up to track the virus and the babies it injures.     In the past month, Puerto Rico and Brazil, hard hit by Zika last year, declared their epidemics over. But smaller numbers of infections continue around the region, according to the CDC and the Pan American Health Organization.  “Zika hasn't gone away,” said CDC Acting Director Dr Anne Schuchat. “We can't afford to be complacent.”  The US Zika Pregnancy Registry counts 1,963 pregnant women in US states who had lab tests showing Zika infection since officials began counting in 2016, and another 4,107 in US territories.  Since the beginning of June, 271 pregnant women were added to the registry's Zika count, 80 of them in US states and the rest residents of US territories, although it's not clear when they became infected.  What about nonpregnant travellers? CDC has counted 140 cases so far this year in US states, all of them who had symptoms. The vast majority of people who get Zika don't notice symptoms, yet still are potential spreaders of infection if mosquitoes back home bite them and then someone else. That happened late last year in parts of South Florida and Texas, and local health officials remain on alert in case it happens again.  There is no treatment for Zika.  Babies born to Zika-infected mothers can experience severe, brain-related defects, even if mom had no symptoms. Abnormally small heads, called microcephaly, are the most attention-getting defect. Babies also may have hearing or vision loss, seizures, trouble swallowing, or restricted limb movement. Zika infection also can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth.  What's the risk? About one in 20 women with Zika so far have had babies with birth defects in US territories, according to the latest pregnancy registry data. Risk was higher if mom was infected during the first trimester, but even third trimester infections have sometimes led to birth defects.  Another scary issue: Some babies appear fine at birth, only to develop health problems later on. What if Zika can harm a newborn's still-developing brain like it does a foetal brain? After all, one way Zika does its damage is by attacking developing brain cells called neural progenitor cells, and babies retain many of those cells for months after birth.  To find out, the National Institutes of Health(NIH) just funded a new study in Guatemala, where Zika still is spreading, to track the health of 500 newborns and 700 other children ages one to five.  “Our concern is that a developing brain in early life can be impacted significantly,” Dr Flor Munoz of Baylor College of Medicine, who will help lead the study, said in a statement. “It's an important question to address not just for children that live in the endemic areas, but also for children who travel to these areas.”  Back in the US, public health advocates worry that US$1.1 billion Congress approved last year to study and fight Zika is running out — including funding for a birth defects surveillance program intended to monitor affected babies' development and connect them to health services.  That surveillance is critical for knowing what's going on, said Dr Oscar Alleyne of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “Otherwise, we're flying blind.”  The NIH recently began the first large test of a potential vaccine, a study that aims to enrol 2,400 people in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and five Zika-prone countries. There are no signs of safety problems, but if Zika infections remain at low levels, it's likely to take more than one summer of shots to prove if the vaccine really protects.  This kind of virus “almost certainly is not going to disappear completely,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently told Congress.

I know you are supposed to wait 6 months to conceive if your partner has been there. Has anyone conceived after a trip there or to any other Zika countries? He was very diligent with putting on bug spray, and didn't notice any bites (not to say he didn't get one or two). I'm only 6.5 weeks along and my OB doesn't see women until 11 weeks. Is or something I should press about being seen? I've been trying to call the office for a straight week, every day all day with no response. (Maybe also time to switch OBs??) Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  25 Posts m  miraclemommyx3 At this point, what's done is done, but you should use condoms when having sex until you're both tested since the virus can be passed through sex. 11 weeks is crazy though, and personally, I'd be worried about having an OB that I can't get in contact with in case of an emergency. Reply  Close k  kelseyoliver88 My hubby and I made a baby a month after returning from the Caribbean. You should go to your primary doctor so they can start the process. They'll take your blood and send it off somewhere to be tested for Zika. You DO NOT need to call the CDC or do any work. Your primary doctor can do it for you. They know what to do and where to send your blood sample. Or wait until you go to your obgyn. They will NOT want to see you sooner from my experience. You'll have to wait just like any normal pregnancy. Reply  Close k  kelseyoliver88 And yes use condoms for sexy time from now on. Reply  Close w  winenot Anyone know how long they can do blood work for after a trip? My husband and I conceived four months after a trip to the Caribbean. Now it's been five months since our trip. I'm assuming that we have to wait until our 20 week scan now as it's too late for blood work but I don't see my midwife until 8 weeks (two more weeks).  I hate how it's such differing advice. I heard that if no symptoms than four months was long enough to wait. Ugh. Reply  Close t  thirdbabesacharm @winenot  I'm in the same boat as you! Conceived 4 months after a trip to the Caribbean. My husband and I both dont remember getting any bites let alone seeing any bugs. I saw my OB soon after who said four months is probably sufficient if you didnt get bit but the CDC recommends 6 months. We conceived exactly four months after our trip (by surprise) but am still going to ask to get tested on Thursday at my appt. Reply  Close J  Jillybean59226 There's no benefit to going in early......unfortunately there is no treatment for the zika virus. They will test you and confirm if your infected and talk about your risk, that's about it right now. You and baby would be monitored throughout your pregnancy.....not all babies in are effected negatively by the virus.....there are so many variables, they're still trying to figure it all out.... They recommend getting tested within 12 weeks, so you'll still be within that timeline.... If your hubby wore bug spray and didn't receive very many bites, it's unlikely he was infected......your chances of contracting the virus are based on length of exposure and how many bites you received. I know it's hard.....but try and relax some :) Reply  Close k  kelseyoliver88 @winenot  I think they only test after 12 weeks. So I think you missed that opportunity to check. Reply  Close C  ChaChaDipper Hey! I'm going through this too. Got back from a week long mission trip in Honduras (my husband didn't go) and went in a week after getting back to get tested just to be safe before we started trying. They told me to just wait 8 weeks because the test results can take 4 to 8 weeks to return, also to not get tested bc I wasn't symptomatic and I was not pregnant. We planned to wait but unexpectedly got pregnant that June (I am 5 weeks pregnant). The time frame to get tested is 2 - 12 weeks after exposure. Since I am pregnant the state approved me for testing. I gave blood and urine one week ago today. Basically, the OB said it was up to me to be tested and that I would have to navigate that process by speaking with the health dept. So I called our local health dept., the lady gathered my info and called the state to see if I am allowed to take the test, she called me back to say that I am and then she needed my family doctor's name and she contacted him and he spent a day gathering all the paperwork (there is a lot for them to do, I did hardly any). Once he got the papers to the health dept. then I the labs were ordered. This whole process took two days. Sorry for the run on sentence lol. Anyways, I don't remember getting bit either but of course wanted to get checked so I am not so concerned at each US regarding growth. I recently read an article saying there have been so many false positives here in the US that the CDC is considering scaling back on testing in some capacity due to the concern that ensues when folks receive a positive that they later learn is false. I hope that is of comfort. I just run to my God and pray because the waiting is hard and He is my anchor. Please keep us posted and let me know if you'd like to email. Have you checked out the zika discussion board? Reply  Close d  duhlenberg We had our honeymoon at the Mayan Rivera may 1st and conceived June 14th. We kept a lot of bug spray on and even though I wasn't too concerned I still wanted to get checked but my doctor said you have to be pregnant AND have symptoms. So when I went back I said that I'm pregnant and was a bit sick when I got home and so I received the test and it was negative. Nice piece of mind but I know quite a few people who have conceived on their trip or shortly after throughout the years and I've never heard of anyone having the Zika virus so if say try not to worry too much as stressing could be worse for the baby. Reply  Close C  Chemiss I live in Jamaica. Not much of a threat here anymore. I haven't even heard anyone mentioning ZIKA since sometime last year. Reply  Close L  Lauramm1919 My husband and I were both in Ecuador in March. My first appointment with the obgyn nurse she asked those questions, then called the CDC who confirmed I needed a blood test. It was negative but it is good they are being so vigilant. From what I understand, and I know adults who had Zika, it's flu like symptoms for a couple weeks. It's an over abundance of caution but it's necessary. Call your obgyn office and tell them you were out of the country to a Zika region. They will order a blood test. Good luck. Reply  Close m  maylove_90021790 My partner visited Guadalajara, Mexico in late May we conceived early June...he went back for a family ordeal in July basically the doctor suggested we use condoms for the rest of our pregnancy, since I didn't travel they aren't testing me for Zika, they are waiting till around 16 or 20 weeks to measure the babies head to see if it's growing properly.  Reply  Close E  Efree0520 I had to be tested too and my doctors office told me they only gave until 12 weeks after travel to send in the blood work. After that, they will wait until your 20 week US and take head measurements. Reply  Close m  mambiann30 the Zika virus is NOT a threat in JAMAICA.... Reply  Close M  Megnolia I'm in the exact same situation.... we were in Jamaica in June (9-17) and about 3 weeks later my husband and I conceived... it wasn't planned, we were actually using precautions due to the fact that we were just in the Caribbean but we are pregnant - miracles happen! It's our first, I'm so happy and excited as we really wanted to start trying soon but had planned to wait. We are nervous due to the scare of Zika virus but we were also careful and got maybe 2 mosquito bites between us. According to my calculations I'm about 5.5 weeks pregnant now. I have my first doctors appointment this Friday.... I'll keep you posted as to what they say. Good luck!!! Reply  Close m  mambiann30 the Zika virus is NOT a threat in JAMAICA....

Extremely rare, with fewer than 1,000 U.S. cases per year, the symptoms range from fever to range to joint pain to red eyes. However, in recent times, the World Health Organization has declared the Zika virus as a global public health emergency with more and more cases popping up in America.    The most recent victim? Chrissy Rutherford. A New York-based, 30-year-old senior digital editor for Harper’s Bazaar didn’t think her trip to Kingston, Jamaica would leave her with weird muscle pain” in her legs or “a charley horse pain” in her left thigh. She didn’t immediately link the pain to Zika virus, but when a lump formed behind her ear and a rash broke out on her face, she knew something had gone array.  “[Zika] definitely had not crossed my mind until I started breaking out in a rash… That’s when I was like ‘Okay, there’s definitely something wrong with me,’ ” Rutherford told PEOPLE . “I was feeling really tired. I had plans to go out with a friend, but I had to cancel on her. I told her it’s hard to explain what’s going on with my body… I have no idea.”  Photo Credit: COURTESY CHRISSY RUTHERFORD  Rutherford first came to the assumption that she might have Zika during a train ride to a wedding in Westchester, New York. She wrote an op-ed for Harper’s Bazaar , explaining that while taking a selfie she noticed her skin looked “unusually bumpy.” “I was like ‘Oh my God, there’s really something wrong with me,’ ” she says. “I don’t ever get rashes.” When she approached her friends about the idea, it was met with laughter from friends who told her “not to be ridiculous!”    After, Rutherford’s mother who is also a nurse, advised her to drink lots of water and get tested for Zika. “When I was [in Jamaica], I was like, ‘What are the chances I would actually get [Zika],’ ” she said. “I had put bug spray on once or twice, but I wasn’t super vigilant about it, and I didn’t put any on during the daytime.”  She then immediate sought out medical attention, where they did a blood test and took samples of her urine. “I spent a lot of that time reading information on the Internet. I was home and in bed for days. I was pretty certain that [Zika] was what I had,” Rutherford recalls.  A week later, the doctors confirmed that she had tested positive for Zika. “In a way, I felt like, ‘Oh, okay, I wasn’t crazy!’ ” I did have this even though some of my friends thought it was something else,” she said. “I wasn’t too worried, because I’m not planning on having a baby anytime soon, so I know that the effects are a lot less scary for me.”        🍹 #jamaica #kingston #hellshire  A post shared by Chrissy Rutherford (@chrissyford) on May 31, 2016 at 11:09am PDT    Rutherford’s symptoms have since receded and she has returned to work.  “They say it only stays in your system for up to a week, so I technically don’t have it anymore,” she says. “It does suck and you feel terrible for a couple of days, but I think you just have to ride it out.    “It’s very frightening for those who are trying to get pregnant,” she also explained. “There needs to be more education about what is going on.”  For those that are traveling out of the United States, Rutherford advises all to “read up” on the Zika virus.  “Everyone really needs to understand what [Zika] is,” said. “That’s all you can do is really wear bug spray and make sure you are wearing the right one that can protect you from the mosquitoes that spread the virus. I think it’s important to be informed.  Share this: Twitter Facebook Google Like this: Like  Loading...

Take meticulous anti-mosquito bite measures during the daytime. Pregnant travellers should postpone travel to this country. Description  Zika Virus infection is caused by the Zika Virus (ZIKV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The virus is primarily transmitted by infected daytime biting female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which are typically active from dawn to dusk. There is evidence that Zika Virus is also transmitted by other mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus. The virus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Human transmission can also occur through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. In some patients, researchers have found that the virus can be shed through saliva and urine. Risk Zika Virus is present in Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, tropical areas of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and parts of Africa. All travellers are at risk. Long-term travellers and aid or missionary workers going to areas where Zika Virus is endemic are at greater risk. Information about the virus is continuously evolving. However, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika Virus causes neurological complications: Guillain-Barré syndrome (progressive muscle weakness that can lead to temporary paralysis) and microcephaly (decreased head size which may lead to developmental delays) in infants born to pregnant women infected with the virus. Symptoms In the majority of cases, Zika Virus infection is asymptomatic – persons do not exhibit symptoms. Those with symptoms usually get ill 3-12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms include mild fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and general malaise. The illness is characterized by pink eye (inflammation of the conjunctiva), a skin rash with red spots on the face, neck, trunk, and upper arms which can spread to the palms or soles, and sensitivity to light. Some may also have a lack of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and dizziness. Most people fully recover from the illness within 7 days. Treatment includes supportive care of symptoms. There is no antiviral treatment available. The Zika Virus is related to Dengue , Yellow Fever , West Nile Virus , and Japanese Encephalitis . It may be misdiagnosed for Dengue and Chikungunya . Prevention Travellers going to areas with Zika Virus should take meticulous measures to prevent mosquito bites during the daytime. There is currently no preventive medication or vaccine against Zika Virus.  Use a repellent containing 20%-30% DEET or 20% Picaridin on exposed skin. Re-apply according to manufacturer's directions.  Wear neutral-coloured (beige, light grey) clothing. If possible, wear long-sleeved, breathable garments.  If available, pre-soak or spray outer layer clothing and gear with permethrin.  Get rid of water containers around dwellings and ensure that door and window screens work properly.  Apply sunscreen first followed by the repellent (preferably 20 minutes later).  More details on insect bite prevention .     Pregnancy and Zika Virus  Travellers who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should postpone travel to areas with Zika Virus transmission.  To avoid sexual transmission of the virus to a pregnant partner , travellers who have been in areas with risk of Zika Virus transmission should practice safe sex for the duration of the pregnancy.  All travellers, particularly partners considering pregnancy , should practice safe sex or abstinence for at least 6 months if one or both partners have travelled to an area with risk of Zika Virus transmission. Practicing safe sex is recommended even if you or your partner do not have symptoms. Most Zika Virus infections are asymptomatic (show no signs or symptoms), but transmission of the virus to another person can still occur.  If you travel to or live in an area with risk of Zika virus transmission, follow meticulous mosquito bite prevention measures during the daytime.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She added, “We’ve become more concerned” about the period around the time of conception. “For people who either have the Zika disease or who travel to an area with active Zika transmission, we are now recommending they wait a period of time before trying to get pregnant.”     Zika Virus Rumors and Theories That You Should Doubt  Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.             For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

Bermuda has seen double-digit growth in the number of visitors under 45.     By Christopher Muther  Globe Staff  October 26, 2016        HAMILTON, Bermuda — This island has always been a popular port for cruise ships depositing families and baby boomers in the pink sand of Horseshoe Bay beach. But there’s a new, rapidly growing demographic arriving in Bermuda — young couples hoping to avoid Zika. Over the past nine months, Bermuda has seen double digit growth in the number of visitors under the age of 45. Tourism officials on the island are hesitant to attribute the increase entirely to those seeking romantic, Zika-free beaches, but the rise comes at a time when Caribbean islands are getting hit by cancellations and vacationers are looking for alternate destinations that are free of the mosquito-spread disease. “The island does not have the mosquito that carries the virus,” said Victoria Isley, chief sales and marketing officer for the Bermuda Tourism Authority. “This has made Bermuda a safe option for young mothers or young mothers-to-be and couples.”   Advertisement     Zika is primarily carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The virus causes flulike symptoms in most people, but is especially devastating for pregnant women because it can cause the birth defect microcephaly and other neurological deficits. It can also cause miscarriages and stillborn births. The CDC advises that women who are pregnant, or women considering children in the near future, avoid nonessential travel to areas where Zika has been reported.

No, not at all,” Isley said. “We hope our appeal as a destination is more than that.”  The increase in visitors to Bermuda is strongest among 25- to 34-year-olds. This coincides with the average age when couples marry and start families (29 for men, 27 for women, according to the US Census Bureau). From January to September 2016, the number of 25- to 34-year-old visitors increased by nearly 33 percent, from, 17,000 to 22,500 over the previous year. The second largest bump was travelers between 18 and 24, with an increase of more than 20 percent. Bermuda may be Zika-free, but its coordinates (it’s just 570 miles off the coast of North Carolina) puts it at a temperate disadvantage to the Caribbean. The average high temperature is 68 degrees in February. The average high temperature the same month in Puerto Rico is 84. For sun worshipers, the mid-80s sounds much more appealing for a day at the beach.   Christopher Muther/Globe staff  A colorful, historic home on Duke of York Street in St. George’s, Bermuda.   Still, for those considering starting a family or for couples on a babymoon, a few degrees may not outweigh safety concerns.   Advertisement     “Bookings to the Caribbean and Mexico are taking a beating,” said Jack Ezon, president of Ovation Vacations in New York. Ezon said a quarter of his clients who have normally booked their winter travel by now have yet to book. About 30 percent of his clients who usually take family vacations in the Caribbean, Mexico, or Florida have shifted their destination to Arizona, California, or Hawaii. Bermuda bookings are most popular from May to September. Bermuda’s lack of locally transmitted Zika is not the result of some cosmic lucky break. The government of the British territory has been actively monitoring its mosquito population and taking precautions for decades. As a result, the country has never experienced outbreaks of dengue fever, chikungunya, or Zika. Bermuda hasn’t staved off these mosquito-borne diseases by fogging and spraying neighborhoods with pesticides. The most effective weapon in Bermuda’s mosquito war? Six hundred simple glass jars. “It may not look like much,” said David Kendell, director of Bermuda’s Department of Health. “But it is incredibly effective.”   Advertisement     The glass jar is dark and filled with plain water, replicating the wet, shady places where female mosquitoes commonly lay their eggs. A textured stick in the jar is the perfect place for the mosquito to deposit the eggs. Workers then fan out over the island each week to check the 600 egg trap jars. The eggs and any hatched larvae found in the water are killed, or brought to a lab and studied. “We don’t wait for the eggs to hatch,” Kendell said. “We have a higher density of egg traps than any other country. We take surveillance seriously. Anywhere you are in Bermuda, you’re probably within 1,000 feet of an egg trap. We have good intel on these mosquitoes.” The mosquitoes that are found in Bermuda are commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito. The Asian tiger mosquito arrived in the US about 30 years ago. They are less effective at carrying diseases than the Aedes aegypti mosquito and therefore seen as less of a Zika threat. The Aedes aegypti, which hasn’t been seen in Bermuda for about a decade, but has been reported in Florida, is responsible for the current Zika outbreak. The absence of Aedes aegypti hasn’t stopped Bermuda’s Department of Public Health from keeping close tabs on the situation. In addition to the 600 egg trap jars, there is a team of 20 workers who can enter private property to enforce what Kendell calls “mosquito laws.” These federal employees check lawns for everyday objects that collect standing water, such as tires, bird baths, watering cans, pet dishes, and potted plants. Employees are allowed issue citations if homeowners don’t address the standing water. They can even prosecute if necessary.   Christopher Muther/Globe staff  Tobacco Beach in Bermuda.   Not only has Bermuda helped advise Caribbean countries on control efforts, it has also become a live laboratory for students at Clark University in Worcester, who visit the island biennially to conduct research experiments and study the island’s mosquito population. “We’ve benefited a lot from the setting,” said Clark professor Todd Livdahl. “We’ve helped them study the two types of mosquitoes, but they already have a smart, aggressive approach. ” Kendell employs the lexicon of a general when he talks about Bermuda’s “strategic strikes,” and “reconnaissance missions” against the insects. “We tend to think we’re always at war with mosquitoes,” he said. “This year it’s Zika, next year it’s something else. The trick is to always stay one step ahead of the enemy.” Christopher Muther can be reached at muther@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @Chris_Muther . Follow him on Instagram @Chris_Muther .

Figures from the health ministry seen by The Sunday Gleaner show that from the notifications, 7,767, or 77 per cent, were determined to be suspected cases of ZIKV. So far, 203 confirmed cases of the virus have been recorded.  According to Chief Medical Officer in the Ministry of Health Dr Winston De La Haye, the numbers are not causing panic among health-care officials, but underscore the need for alertness and vigilance.  "The numbers you see are from private- and public-sector practitioners, and that's exactly what we want them to do. We do not want them to take any chances. We want them to report the cases so that each one can be carefully assessed so that the necessary actions can be taken," said De La Haye.   Microcephaly in babies  With Zika being linked to microcephaly in babies, De La Haye noted that among the notifications received by the health ministry were 827 pregnant women. That group had 698 suspected cases and 78 confirmed cases.  He said the health professionals were equally vigilant about symptoms for malaria and yellow fever as they were about microcephaly - a rare neurological condition in which an infant's head is significantly smaller than the heads of other children of the same age and sex.  Malaria, yellow fever and Zika all have in common the bite of the infected Aedes aegypti mosquito.  De La Haye said, "There are no cases of ZIKV-related microcephaly in Jamaica," as he sought to quell fears among many persons that babies are born with microcephaly because the mothers were bitten by the infected mosquito.  Congenital syndrome associated with the Zika (CSAZ) virus has seen 50 suspected cases to date, of 170 notifications.  Forty-six of the cases were determined to be microcephaly with 35 non-severe cases, four showing other abnormalities such as 'crooked joints', while 11 cases have shown severe microcephaly.  De La Haye said all the children are currently living with their mothers, but this could change.  "Those children are being monitored and are seen a bit more regularly at the clinics. Continuous assessments are made to determine if those children may need to be kept in homes. But for now they are with the parents."  The monitoring is done because children with microcephaly often have developmental issues, and with no treatment for the abnormality, early intervention with supportive therapies, such as speech and occupational therapies, may help improve quality of life, he said.  Meanwhile, there are 166 cases of notified cases of babies with Zika neurological complications. Of that number, 37 are suspected cases, 30 fit the Brigton criteria (specific measurement criteria); seven the Guillain-BarrÈ syndrome (GBS) variant, and four Zika-positive.  Of the total numbers presented, the health ministry said 77 per cent fit the case definition and were classified as suspected. Of the suspected cases, nine per cent were pregnant women, with less than one per cent being suspected CSAZ.  erica.virtue@gleanerjm.com              «Light on Violence | Wrong medicine - Current prescription to fight crime cannot work, says Gayle Messy marriage  - Government moving to divorce regulatory authority from Bureau of Standards»    View the discussion thread.

Public health officials have reported that mosquitoes in Jamaica are infected with Zika virus and are spreading it to people.  Because Zika virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes, CDC recommends that travelers to Jamaica protect themselves from mosquito bites (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites) . The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Travelers whose itineraries are limited to areas above this elevation are at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito. The following map shows areas of Jamaica above and below 6,500 feet.* For more information, see Questions and Answers: Zika risk at high elevations (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/q-a-zika-risk-high-elevations) .    Interactive web map: Search for a place by name, or pan, zoom, and click on the map to display additional information.    Elevation Based Recommendations (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/q-a-zika-risk-high-elevations)  High Elevation (above 6,500 ft/2,000 m)  Low Elevation (below 6,500 ft/2,000 m)  The categories shown on this map are intended as general guidelines and should not be considered to indicate absolute risk.*  *Elevation may vary within an area to a larger extent than this map can depict. The presence of mosquitoes may change seasonally, with increasing temperatures or rainfall, and may change over time. Travelers to destinations that cross or are near an elevation border may wish to consider the area as low elevation. Travelers to high elevations are still at risk of getting Zika from sex.     Zika Virus in Pregnancy  A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:  Should not travel to any area of Jamaica below 6,500 feet (see map).  If you must travel to one of these areas, talk to your doctor first and strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites) during your trip. If your itinerary is limited entirely to areas above 6,500 feet, there is minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito.  Because Zika can also be spread by sex, if you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to Jamaica, either use condoms or do not have sex ( vaginal, anal, or oral ) or share sex toys during your pregnancy.    Women who are trying to become pregnant:  Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika virus infection.  See CDC guidance for how long you should wait to get pregnant after travel to Jamaica.    You and your partner should strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites) .    If you have traveled to Jamaica and have a pregnant partner, use condoms or don’t have sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) or share sex toys during the pregnancy.      Sexual transmission of Zika virus is also possible, so you should use condoms or not have sex during your trip.  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick. Among those who do develop symptoms, sickness is usually mild, with symptoms that last for several days to a week. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis for a few weeks to several months. CDC research suggests that GBS is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS. Most people fully recover from GBS, but some have permanent damage. For more information, see Zika and GBS .  As more information becomes available, this travel notice will be updated. Please check back frequently for the most up-to-date recommendations.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?  There is no vaccine or medicine for Zika. You can protect yourself by preventing mosquito bites: (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites)   Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.  Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), IR3535, or 2-undecanone (methyl nonyl ketone). Always use as directed.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.  Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)    Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.  Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.  Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.  Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.   Because Zika can be spread by sex, if you have sex ( vaginal, anal, or oral ) while traveling, you should use condoms.  After travel:  Many people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person’s blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. If you travel to Jamaica, you should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks after your trip, even if you don’t feel sick, so that you don’t spread Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  If you have visited Jamaica and have a pregnant partner, you should either use condoms or not have sex during the pregnancy.  If you are thinking about pregnancy, talk with your health care provider and wait to become pregnant (see “ Women Trying to Become Pregnant ” for how long to wait). You also should use condoms after travel to protect your sex partners from Zika even if you are not pregnant or trying to become pregnant.  For more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission .  If you feel sick and think you may have Zika:   Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.  Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.  Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.   If you are pregnant:  Talk to a doctor or other health care provider after your trip, even if you don’t feel sick. Pregnant travelers returning from Jamaica, or who have had possible sexual exposure, should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.   If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.  If you do not have symptoms, testing should be offered if you see a health care provider, up to 12 weeks after you return from travel or your last possible sexual exposure.   Clinician Information  All pregnant women should be assessed for Zika virus exposure at each prenatal care visit. Possible exposures to Zika virus that warrant testing include:   Travel to or residence in an area with a current Zika outbreak.  Sex ( vaginal, anal, or oral ) with a partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with a current Zika outbreak.   The type of testing recommended varies according to when a woman’s last possible exposure occurred or when her symptoms began. For more information, please visit the clinical guidance for healthcare providers caring for pregnant women .  Clinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Infants & Children is also available.

It is closely related to other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and there is currently no known vaccine.  For most people Zika presents as a mild infection and is not harmful in the long term.  The real risk is for women who are either pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Zika virus has a strong link with birth defects, the most notable being microcephaly — a condition that affects brain and skull development.  For this reason, pregnant women are advised to avoid or delay traveling to any Zika-affected country.  According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) the Zika virus has spread through most of the Caribbean. The CDC issues alert levels for Zika-affected countries. Many Caribbean countries are currently at alert level 2, and the CDC advises that pregnant women avoid nonessential travel to these places.  Note: country statuses change frequently so it is important to check the most up-to-date travel advisories before you book.  Zika-free travel destinations in the Caribbean  According to the CDC, Zika is not currently present in American Samoa, Guadeloupe,  Martinique and Saint Barthélemy. These lesser-visited destinations might be an ideal alternative for travelers concerned about Zika.  Zika in Aruba  Zika is present in Aruba and is being transmitted to humans via mosquito bites.  The small Dutch-administered island is part of the aptly named ABC island chain, along with Bonaire and Curacao. With its white sand beaches, glorious weather, and luxurious resorts it has long been a popular spot for romantic getaways, honeymoons, and babymoons.      Unfortunately, the island is currently at alert level 2, which means that pregnant women should find a different Caribbean vacation spot that is Zika free.  Zika in the Bahamas  Zika has also been confirmed in the Bahamas.  The Bahamas is a collection of more than 700 islands in the Caribbean Sea that stretch from the North Atlantic to Florida’s east coast. The country has long been a popular maritime playground for sun-seeking visitors and cruise ship passengers.  Like Aruba, the Bahamas is at alert level 2, which means that it is essential that all travelers are extremely careful to avoid or prevent mosquito bites and higher risk groups should avoid all non-essential travel.  Zika in Barbados  Zika is present in Barbados and is being transmitted to people via infected mosquitoes. Barbados is popular for its picture-postcard beaches and opulent resorts. But with a long history and its UNESCO world heritage capital, the island is far more than simply a beach destination.  Despite being another ideal spot for honeymooners and romantic retreats, the island is currently at alert level 2 which means that mosquito bite prevention measures should be carefully observed and pregnant women should look elsewhere for the time being.  Zika in the Dominican Republic  Zika is confirmed to be present in the Dominican Republic.  Unlike its less fortunate neighbor, Haiti, the Dominican Republic has a strong, growing economy and rapidly-improving living standards. The most popular travel destination in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic draws visitors with its fascinating history, lively culture, and spectacular beaches.      As with many of its Caribbean neighbors, the country is currently at Zika alert level 2, which means enhanced precautions and avoiding non-essential travel for higher-risk groups.  Zika in Cuba  Zika is confirmed as present in Cuba, and mosquitos are transmitting the virus to humans. The outbreak comes at a tragic time for the country, as the gradual easing of US travel restrictions had otherwise promised a transformation for the tourism industry.  But the official advice is still that travelers should take enhanced precautions against mosquito bites and that at-risk groups such as pregnant women should avoid Cuba for now.  Zika in Puerto Rico  Zika is confirmed in Puerto Rico. Although the local authorities have declared that the epidemic is over, the island is still listed at alert level 2 by the CDC which means that enhanced mosquito bite precautions should still be practised, pregnant women should avoid visiting, and safe sex should be practised.  Zika in Jamaica  As with most of the Caribbean, Zika is present in Jamaica and is being transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Much of inland Jamaica is relatively mountainous and Zika-carrying mosquitoes are rarely found above 6,500 feet. But most tourists tend to stay in resorts around the coast and are still at risk. As such, the country is listed by the CDC at alert level 2, enhanced precautions are advised, and the current advice for pregnant women is to avoid all travel to Jamaica.  Bonus Zika-free destination: Bermuda  Although not technically in the Caribbean, the island of Bermuda is considered close enough by most visitors and remains free from the Zika-carrying mosquito.  There have been several cases of Zika in Bermuda, but to date, they have all been imported by visitors from elsewhere. Bermuda is a major stop-off point for cruise ships but also a popular travel destination in its own right, combining trademark tropical beaches with a rich and varied cultural heritage. It’s within a two-hour flight from most eastern US hubs, making it a top contender for Zika-free island breaks.  Note that Zika can also be transmitted sexually, so higher-risk groups should remain cautious.  All information was correct at time of publication but travelers should be sure to check the latest CDC Zika advisories before booking.
