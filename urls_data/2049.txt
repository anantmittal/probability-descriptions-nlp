Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Bodily proof you were almost a member of the fairer sex              By Rachael Schultz and Thinkstock     Sep 18, 2014                                        Sometimes the truth hurts, but nothing hits harder than a blow to your manhood: All guys start out, in utero, as females. “Everyone comes from a common genetic and developmental framework that is tweaked by sex hormones,” says Richard Bribiescas, Ph.D., director of the Yale Reproductive Ecology Laboratory. We all start as a generic embryo. You have a set of male or female sex chromosomes, but the distinction doesn’t kick in until your hormones enter the picture, he explains. Without hormones like testosterone, you would stay on the path to womanhood. And, sorry to say, your body already started developing by the time this decision was made—which means your lady parts were already starting to form.

YOUR NIPPLES Nipples are really just chest ornaments for men, but with the right hormones you could be a milk machine, too. Bribiescas says nipples are formed very early during embryotic development. Post-pregnancy, women produce hormones like prolactin and oxytocin that allow their nipples to fulfill their purpose—to produce milk. “Without production of these hormones, men don’t lactate, although they definitely could in the presence of these important hormones,” Bribiescas adds. YOUR PENIS During development, various hormones—including Müllerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)—are produced by males, causing the internal and external genitalia to develop differently than in females, Bribiescas explains. Because of DHT, the genital bud grows into the penis, but without this hormone, it would become the female clitoris. Meanwhile, MIS keeps the Müllerian ducts from progressing any further in men, keeping you from developing the female internal reproductive tract. So yes, that’s right: Your mountain is just a grown-up version of her valley. THAT WEIRD SEAM RUNNING DOWN YOUR SCROTUM What is that thing?!? Technically, it’s called the raphe line, and without it, you’d have a vagina. During embryotic development, everyone has an opening at their genitals. “Without male hormones, the opening remains and contributes to the development of the labia and vagina,” Bribiescas explains. When male hormones enter the picture, though, the tissue is fused together, leaving a scar that runs from your anus, over your scrotum and up the penis. Consider it a reminder of what could’ve been.

Q&A: How Soon Can You Find Out Baby's Sex?  Dr. Elizabeth Pryor answers the question, How soon can you learn: He or she? By Elizabeth Pryor, MD, FACOG from American Baby  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Ruthblack/shutterstock.com  Question How soon can I find out my baby's sex? I know you can sometimes tell by using ultrasound, but are there any other reliable methods that are used? Answer This is one of the most common questions I receive from parents-to-be. Most patients undergo an ultrasound at around 18-20 weeks (about four and a half to five months). Normally, at this stage of pregnancy we can determine the baby's sex, but not always. The position of the baby during the ultrasound is the most important aspect in our ability to tell the baby's sex, andthere's no way to influence that. For obvious reasons, it's usually easier to see if the baby is a boy. One reliable method is using amniocentesis to check the baby's chromosomes. This test is usually performed on a mother who is 35 years or older, for the purpose of identifying possible genetic problems. It involves inserting a needle into the uterus to remove a small amount of amniotic fluid. We usually do this test at around 16 weeks, so in this instance, the mother can find out the baby's sex a little sooner. This test isn't without risk, however, and isn't generally performed simply to determine the baby's sex. Boy or Girl? Find out now. Boy or Girl: How Genetics Determine Your Baby's Gender Another test that can look at the baby's chromosomes is called CVS (chorionic villus sampling), which is performed during the first trimester to look for problems with the baby's chromosomes. However, this test is infrequently used. I'm often asked if you can tell the baby's sex by the heart rate -- on the myth that one sex is faster than another -- but that is just an old wives' tale. Some people claim they can tell the baby's sex by the way you're carrying, but, again, there is no scientific proof that this is true. Still others use a "pendulum test" in which an object is suspended over the pregnant belly and the baby's sex is predicted depending on which way the pendulum swings. Again, there is no documented proof that this test works. Don't get frustrated if the doctor can't tell what the baby's sex is on ultrasound. You'll know soon enough.

Visit our community    Can you really choose the sex of your baby? For as long as we've been making babies , women have been exchanging ideas about how to increase their chances of having either a boy or a girl. Unfortunately there's no medical evidence that any of them actually work!  Having said that, there'll always be a mum who tells you an old wives' tale worked for her. So if you fancy defying the experts and trying to tip the balance towards one sex yourself, why not try some of the suggestions below.   You're more likely to conceive a boy if... You have sex on the day of ovulation , as male sperm are thought to swim faster and reach the egg first. You reach orgasm before your partner, as this releases an alkaline fluid, thought to be more male-sperm friendly than the vagina's natural acidity. You have deep penetration during sex, such as from behind (doggie-style). Your partner has a high sperm count. This is because male sperm are not as strong as female sperm, and so the higher the count, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first. You avoid sex for a week before ovulation and then only have sex once on ovulation day, to keep the sperm count high. Your partner suggested the love-making. You make love at night. You make love on odd days of the month. Your partner keeps his genitals cool by wearing boxer shorts and loose-fitting trousers. You eat salty food, plenty of meat, fish, white flour, pasta, fresh fruit, certain vegetables, but avoid milk and dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, nuts, chocolate, shellfish and wholemeal bread. You're more likely to conceive a girl if... You have sex earlier on in your cycle, a few days before your day of ovulation. This is because female sperm are thought to be stronger and therefore last longer than male sperm, who will die off before reaching the egg. Your partner reaches orgasm before you. You have sex frequently to lower your partner's sperm count, and so increase the chances of the female sperm reaching the egg first. You keep penetration shallow. You stop having unprotected sex four to five days before ovulation, to minimise the chances of the male sperm reaching the egg first. Your partner keeps his genitals warm by wearing close-fitting underwear and tight trousers (although this isn't likely to do his general fertility any good!) You suggested the love-making. You make love in the afternoon. You make love on even days of the month. You put a wooden spoon under your bed and a pink ribbon under your pillow. You drink plenty of milk and eat dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, unsalted foods, rice, pasta, certain vegetables, mineral water, limited amounts of meat and potatoes, but avoid salt and any salty foods, wine and beer, fresh fruit, spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms, chocolate, coffee and tea.

I have two boys and have been blogging about wanting to have a girl for some time. I had gone through most of the experiences posted by women, like gender dieting, douching etc but they didn't really make any sense to me. Ultimately, I picked Urobiologics (based in the US) who have literally proven that, although gender is 'determined' by sperms, women select the gender of the baby based on the cycle she conceives, by choosing to conceive in the correct alternating cycle. We were given a conception plan to try to conceive in the girl cycle (you send off urine samples to Urobiologics, who will then determine when you will be in a boy or girl cycle). We became pregnant with our girl (we used their post-gender test to check the gender of the baby at around 7 weeks). Sadly our little Poppy girl died at 16 weeks (31 Oct) due to a PPROM, so we are leaving it a couple of months to heal and then go via the PreGender Preconception Test route again. I'm ready now!

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

The believe that the habits and diet of the man can also affect the ratio of male and female sperm cells he produces. They also said that certain couples are more likely to have children of one sex, and that it is more common to see families with several children of the same sex than would be expected if the odds for each child were 50/50. I've done some research and I'm not finding good evidence for any of this. Everything I'm finding indicates that meiosis in men always produces half male sperm, half female sperm, that there is no difference between them in morphology or behavior, and therefore the odds of having a boy or a girl really are 50/50. Am I right about this or is there something I am missing?        20th Apr 2010 14:55:15     Jonathan Max Berman    SUNY Buffalo  Posts: 68         Any proposed behavioral changes in parents do not have a have an affect on the gender of offspring. Families with large numbers of male or female offspring result from the "rule of large numbers." If you flip a coin enough times you  will eventually get heads five times in a row simply by chance. There are known ways of influencing the sex of a child. Female sperm are slightly heavier than male sperm due to the extra mass of the x chromosome and will tend to sink to the bottom of a test tube when centrifuged. This allows some parents using in vitro fertilization to select the sex of a child with greater accuracy than chance. Perhaps the most effective (and ethically dubious) method used by parents is selective abortion where only children of the desired gender are brought to term.        20th Apr 2010 15:43:51     Paolo Viscardi    Horniman Museum, London, UK  Posts: 1,105         Third time lucky (my other attempts have all failed to post). Males do indeed produce equal numbers of X and Y sperm. Your neighbour may be using a variant of the Shettles method that has been around since the 1970s, which works on the assumption that X and Y sperm travel at different speeds, have different longevity and are sensitive to different levels of acidity. There is little support for this theory. X and Y sperm swim at the same average speeds, although their behaviour is apparently different in variable flow conditions, probably due to the difference in mass ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6541168 ). There is some evidence that females with high energy (or possibly nutirent) intake prior to conception are slightly more likely to have male children ( http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/  /1661.full ). However, the difference is only a few percent and I can find no evidence to suggest that male nutrition or habits play any role at all.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

As males have only one X chromosome, inheriting that chromosome will mean that they will be affected by the disease. Females however, have two X chromosomes and as haemophilia is a recessive disease, two defective X chromosomes would have to be inherited for a female to be affected. In this case, the father is unaffected, and as he has to pass on a healthy X chromosome to his daughters, the probability of female offspring being affected is 0, regardless of the genotype of the mother. Any male offspring will inherit a Y chromosome from their father and an X chromosome from their mother, but there is a possibility that the mother might be a carrier (if she has both a healthy and a defective X chromosome) even though she is unaffected. If the mother is a carrier (which we don’t know in this question), the probability of a son inheriting the defective X chromosome and being affected by haemophilia is 50%.

  heterozygous for a simple Mendelian autosomal gene alpha have a child, the probability 
  that the child will show the dominant phenotype is 3/4. Let's ask
  a somewhat more complex question. If this couple has a total of four children, 
  what is the probability that 3 of the 4 will show the dominant phenotype? To 
  answer this, we will first derive the appropriate formula and then use it to 
  calculate the numerical answer. The same formula allows us to understand the 
  expected statistical distribution of the various possible phenotype patterns 
  in four-child ( or any other size) families in a large population.    1. Review: How can some simple overall probabilities be calculated 
  by combining the multiplication and addition "rules" we covered earlier?  Let's start with a very simple case: asking about gender probabilities in families 
  of three children.  What is the probability that all three children in a family will be the same 
  gender? P(all female)= 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all male ) = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all one gender) = P(all female) + P(all male) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4  What is the probability that a three-child family is two girls and one boy? Each possible birth order has P=1/8. That is, P(G,G,B)=P(G,B,G)=P(B,G,G)=1/8. So, P(2G,1B)= 3/8 and P(1G,2B)= 3/8.  This allows us to write the overall gender probability distribution for families 
  of three children as follows: 1/8 will be three girls 3/8 will be two girls and one boy 3/8 will be one girl and two boys 1/8 will be three boys Adding it all up, we have 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 1 (100%)     2. How can we understand and use "Pascal's triangle" 
  and the "general rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities", 
  formula 1 (page 161 in textbook)?  Consider the numerators of the fractions in the above three-child family gender 
  equation: 1 , 3 , 3 , 1. These numbers are the coefficients in the expansion of the term 
  (p + q) cubed. In general, the coefficients of any such binomial expansion { the 
  term (p+q) raised to any power} give the "number of ways" that something 
  can happen.  Figure 4.21, "Pascal's triangle", shows these coefficients for the expansion 
  of (p + q) raised to any power up to 10. The numbers in any row can be used 
  just as described above. For example, assume that over the next two decades 
  you have 6 kids. There are 64 possible gender birth orders, with 20 of these 
  resulting in you having three girls and three boys.  The terms p and q are the individual probabilities for a specific outcome from 
  a single "event". For "gender" calculations, the probabilities p and 
  q are equal, both = 1/2 (the equal probabilities of male and female births).  For "dominant : recessive phenotype" type of calculations, p and q will usually 
  not be equal. For a simple Mendelian inheritance from two heterozygotic parents, 
  p will = 3/4 (if AA and Aa give dominant phenotype) and q will 
  = 1/4 ( aa gives recessive phenotype).  Generalizing this, we get to the formula on page 161 in your text that is "the general 
  rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities". The term (n!/s!t!) 
  is the number of possible ways (orders) of getting a certain net outcome ( "a 
  total of n ; with s of one and t of the other"). This 
  number can either be calculated or taken directly from Pascal's triangle.    3. Sample problem: You and your mate are both heterozygous 
  for some simple Mendelian gene alpha (i.e., each of you has genotype Aa , and both of you show the dominant phenotype) on chromosome #1. Over 
  the next decade, you proceed to have four children. What is the probability 
  that 3 of your children will show the dominant phenotype and one will show the 
  recessive phenotype? What are the probabilities of the other possible outcomes?  If we were looking at thousands of such families, we know that the overall ratio 
  of dominant to recessive phenotypes in the children would average out to 3:1, 
  as shown by a simple Punnett square. But for one couple having four children, 
  what's the probability, P(3D,1r)?  To calculate P(3D,1r), we use formula 1 for the case n=4, s=3, t=1, p=3/4, 
  q=1/4. P(3D,1r)= 4!/3! x (3/4)cubed x (1/4) = 4 x (27/64) x 1/4 = .42 ( 42% )  By also calculating the other four possibilities, we can construct a graph that shows the statistical distribution you would expect 
  to see in a large population.      Problem S-4: "Heterozygous parents; have three children".  Modify the sample problem above to do the calculations for you and your mate (both Aa ) having THREE children. Do the calculations for the probabilities that all three, two, one, or none of the three children will show the dominant phenotype from gene alpha . Construct the graph and compare the result with the "four children" graph done in class.

It seems the answers all seem to assume that P(B)=P(G)=½.  This assumption is only approximately correct. – gerrit  Mar 3 '14 at 15:45         6      @Niharika: To understand why your logic is incorrect, imagine applying it to purchasing a lottery ticket: there are two outcomes and one is favorable, so your odds of winning would be 1/2.

The 2012 (most recent available) data for England and Wales published by the UK's  Office for National Statistics shows a bias towards male births (51.3% of live births).

It could be that upon checking one single casino and a very fair, well-balanced die, the probability to get some number (say, 3) is slightly higher than $\;1/6\;$ (because of the hand throwing the dice, the table, the material the die is made of, etc.), but we usually assume some events to have "the usual, standard" probability to happen. – DonAntonio  Mar 3 '14 at 12:11        1      @DMM you could just as easily say that the probability is $50\%$ and it there was an experimental error of $2.6\%$ ;) – Guy  Mar 3 '14 at 18:47         2      @DonAntonio Except that every measurement everywhere shows that more males are born than females.

Each time you have a boy or a girl, in the next generation you can have a boy or a girl also, so the number of possibilities is doubled each generation.  In terms of your problem, when you have a boy, that represents a checkmark against "at least one of them is a boy", so I've crossed the box concerned. However all the subsequent generations after this boy are also families in which there is at least one boy, so I've crossed those out too. You can see that the chance of having at least one boy is $1/2$ in the first generation, $3/4$ in the second, and $7/8$ in the third. This generalizes to $(2^n-1)/2^n$ in the nth generation.  Conversely the chance of having no boys is $1/2$ in the first generation, $1/4$ in the second, and $1/8$ in the third. This generalizes to $1/2^n$ in the nth generation.  (Essentially I've drawn a probability tree diagram here, which generalizes to much more complicated problems).     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 4 '14 at 18:41             answered Mar 3 '14 at 14:51       TooTone   4,930 1 14 39                  Should your second-last sentence be "the chance of not having at least one boy"? – Andrew Leach  Mar 4 '14 at 18:37            @AndrewLeach thankyou, brain dzzzzt – TooTone  Mar 4 '14 at 18:39        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I’m adding an answer since I’m not reputable enough to add a comment to “lab bhattacharjee”’s answer.

Tuesday, November 08, 2016  Are large families of the same gender a statistical fluke? Mother of four sons, Gwen Loughman goes behind the myths In 1970’s Ireland, families with six or more children were the norm. CSO figures almost five decades later however, sees numbers for such families drop from 15,000 to a mere 3,000. Having four children in 21st century Ireland is considered a large family but to have more, and for those children to be all of the same gender, is a rarity and an attraction in itself.  Myths about how to conceive a girl or boy child have been around for centuries. During the reign of King Henry VIII it was widely believed the responsibility to produce the desired male gender fell to the female. Science has since proven otherwise.  Therese Murphy, lecturer in Medical Sciences, University of Exeter clears up just who determines the baby’s gender. “A baby’s genetic sex is determined by the man’s sperm as the sperm cell will contain either an X or a Y chromosome. It is the Y chromosome that is essential for the development of the male reproductive organs. When a Y chromosome is not present an embryo will develop into a female.”  Sex ratio  Carmel Kennedy, Ballyphehane, Cork with her eight sons. Carmel Kennedy from Ballyphehane, Cork with eight sons aged 37 to 20 is no stranger to people passing comments about her brood over the years. “I could talk for hours about some of the things people said. I did have girls but did not go to term with them. I always wanted a large family; I’m one of six girls and four boys and we had a beautiful childhood. Now I have eight healthy, respectful sons and lovely grand-daughters of my own,” she says. Professor Louise Kenny from Cork University Maternity Hospital Perinatal Medicine says in general, worldwide, slightly more boys are born than girls. “If left to nature there will be about 105 boys born for every 100 girls. However, 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 107 boys born for every 100 girls, largely driven by the skewed ratio caused by sex selection prior to birth in China, where about 118 boys are born for every 100 girls.” Statistical coincidence? Michelle Masterson Power and husband David have four daughters aged eight to 14. Their sons are six and four. “Because we were used to being parents of just girls, it meant we didn’t know any differently. David grew up with five sisters and one brother so he was very comfortable being a father of daughters. But once the boys came along, we learned the truth in that old saying, boys wreck the house. That one is so true! “ Michelle says her house was a very different one before the boys arrived. “It was very girly. Civilised, I’d say.” Michelle Masterson Power and Cillian, Orlagh, Ciarán, Eimear, Aoife, Ailbhe, Masterson Power. Naturally, there was great excitement when Cillian arrived, creating a particular interest in nappy changes! “The girls each took turns holding him and I had to time them! They were amazed when he wee’d all over me one day.” The odds of having a girl or a boy are the same with a one in two chance of it being one or the other. 50/50 if you like. However, what about bigger families of the same gender; are they a statistical coincidence? Dr Murphy again: “The probability of having a boy or a girl from a genetics point of view, remain the same each time a baby is conceived. However, there is some epidemiological evidence to suggest other factors may influence sex determination in humans. There is an argument about the motility and/ or survival of Y-carrying sperm and X-carrying sperm and timing of ovulation but it’s important to note that there are no robust ‘biological’ explanations for their observations to date.” There are various techniques and methods that allegedly improve the chances of conceiving a girl or a boy such as The Shettles Method and The Whelan Methods. Not forgetting particular diets and the slightly even more dubious practice of female douching. All have their believers and sceptics. Professor Louise Kenny has this to say. “In a nutshell there is no evidence that timing of intercourse affects sex ratio. There are several scientific studies that have disproven this. Furthermore, there is evidence that limiting intercourse within the fertile time will reduce your chances of getting pregnant at all. So my advice to couples would be to accept that at every conception there is approximately a 50:50 chance of conceiving a child of either sex and there’s very little than can be done to materially alter this,” she says. Historically speaking, there were massive gender divides. Concerns such as providing dowries for daughters and the birth of a male heir guaranteeing property retention saw one gender being preferred over the other. Thankfully, times have changed and when it comes to large families, issues like privacy and parental support are more relevant. Gwen Loughman with her sons Liam, Conor, Brendan, and Iarla. Carmel Kennedy had her own alternative support system in place when her boys were younger. “My sisters and I were there for each other and my sons had lots of friends and were always out playing so we mums would all stand at our gates and keep an eye on the kids. My coffee mornings were a cup of tea at the gate! And at night we called to each other’s houses.” She would agree being surrounded by menfolk meant privacy was limited. “I didn’t have any, I suppose. It’s only in the last seven years I have had my own bedroom space really as I always had a child or two asleep in my room. When they were babies and I was trying to shower, they used to scream at the door till I finished,” she says. Konrad, 26, is Carmel’s sixth-born and says life with seven brothers was for him just normal but, “for an outsider looking in it must have looked mental. It was never a silent house. We were all into music so it was loud and with eight boys comes a tonne of friends so people were always in and out. My mother was very relaxed. I think she likes the noise. I think we all turned out fairly well. We know now it was tough for my mother. But she never let it show,” he says. The teenage years are on the horizon for the Masterson Power family but Michelle is a woman of little or no fear. She feels can handle the mood swings and teenage dramas thanks to her daughters. “The girls are great with their brothers. They are very much the bosses but are also quite tolerable as the boys are much more demanding physically. Their dad grew up with sisters and has a great understanding of girls particularly in the teenage years, I think the boys will be the same.” Michelle and David encourage their children to have the same values as their parents when they grow up. “I tell the girls to find a man like their dad.”   © Irish Examiner Ltd.

In the middle ages, women believed they could swing the odds of having a son by asking their husbands to turn their faces eastwards during sex. Others disagreed – husbands should be seduced over a cocktail prepared with red wine and fresh rabbit’s womb . If that didn’t do the trick, the 18th Century French anatomist Procope-Couteau had a rather extreme measure. Men who’d “give their left testicle for a baby boy” should do exactly that, he said. He claimed the surgery was no more painful than extracting a tooth. Even today, a quick search of the internet reveals an array of exotic solutions – from vitamins to cough syrup, to changing your underwear . The more rational among us may be sure that none of it makes any difference. Each conception is a flip of the coin: there’s always an equal chance a baby will be a boy or a girl. It’s purely a matter of probability – and you can’t cheat lady luck. Yet recent research shows parents may have been inadvertently rigging the odds for thousands of years – and the true factors which make a difference are stranger than anything our superstitious ancestors could have imagined. Male mortality We now know that bad weather makes for more baby girls, as does fasting for Ramadan or suffering from morning sickness . Meanwhile mothers with dominant personalities , a taste for breakfast cereal or billionaire husbands are more likely to have baby boys. Crucially, a predisposition to having more sons or daughters is encoded in our genetics – men with more sisters tend to have girls while those with more brothers tend to have boys. What’s going on? I now see that the whole problem is so intricate that it is safer to leave its solution for the future – Charles Darwin In fact, the odds of having a boy vs. having a girl have never been exactly 50:50. Worldwide, there are around 109 boys born for every 100 girls. This might seem like a lot, but it’s necessary. Men have weaker immune systems, higher cholesterol, more heart problems, a greater susceptibility to diabetes, higher rates of cancer and lower chances of surviving it. They make up over two-thirds of murder victims, three-quarters of traffic accident fatalities and are three times more likely to commit suicide. Mothers have to have a higher proportion of sons in order for an equal number to survive.  View image of (Credit: iStock) The relative odds of conceiving sons or daughters have been baffling scientists for decades. The phenomenon was particularly mysterious to Charles Darwin, who meticulously studied the proportion of male and female offspring in a number of animals. He was convinced that the elaborate features of many male animals, such a peacock’s tail, must be a consequence of a dire shortage of the opposite sex. In these species, he figured, more competition had favoured males which stood out from the crowd. There was just one problem. In every species he studied, there were almost (but not exactly) the same number of males and females; the variation was not nearly as wide as he had expected. After failing to find any convincing evidence, eventually he abandoned the whole topic, remarking “…I now see that the whole problem is so intricate that it is safer to leave its solution for the future.” So why is the sex ratio close to 50:50, but not exactly? It was a tricky subject in need of a daring intellectual mind. Enter Robert Trivers, a renegade scientist like no other. According to his own website , he’s spent time behind bars, formed an armed gang in Jamaica to protect gay men from violence and driven a getaway car for notorious political activist Huey Newton. The Ivy League professor has been barred from university campuses, suffered mental breakdowns and broken with tradition by changing disciplines numerous times, from maths, to law, to history, to genetics. Now he’s an anthropologist at Rutgers University. “Compared to many other scientists I’ve lived a wild life,” he says.  View image of (Credit: Getty Image) Back in 1972, after tiring of history, he turned his attention to Darwin’s problem. “I said whoa – now there’s an idea worth devoting my life to,” says Trivers. Together with a colleague, Dan Willard, he developed one of the most famous theories in evolutionary biology. It’s known as the Trivers-Willard hypothesis and it goes like this. Let’s assume you can choose the sex of your children – and the game is to leave as many descendants as possible. You have a gamble to make. If your children are male, who knows, they might become the next billionaire tycoon, or US President (or both), with plenty of girlfriends to choose from. If your son is a success, it could be a big evolutionary win It’s a scientific fact that high social status is attractive to women. Fertile women prefer more dominant men and the lucky few who achieve money or influence tend to marry younger, more often and have more extra-marital affairs than their peers. If your son is a success, it could be a big evolutionary win. But if he isn’t, he may find himself unable to find a partner at all. “Because women tend to marry ‘up’ the socioeconomic scale – it’s as if women trade in their good looks to some degree – if you’re a man at the bottom of the scale you’re going to struggle to find someone to marry,” says Trivers. Females, by contrast, tend not to face such stiff competition; they have a higher chance of securing a mate and producing some offspring, even if they will never result in as many descendants as a son. That may sound a little bit sexist, but Trivers argues that it arises from the fact that a female invests more in the young, compared to a male who can just have sex and leave the childrearing to the mother. Consider the fact that the most prolific mother in world history was the nameless first wife of a peasant from Shuya, Russia, who lived from 1707 to 1782. In total, local records reveal that she gave birth to 69 children, which is nothing compared to the warrior Genghis Khan, who fathered between 1,000 and 2,000 children before he died in 1227. Today, he’s thought to have around 16 million great, great, ... great grandsons. And Khan is not the only one; a recent DNA analysis revealed at least 10 men from history who have left a legacy comparable with Khan’s, including a Chinese ruler who died in 1582, and the originator of the medieval Uí Néill dynasty in Ireland. In many animals – red deer, elephant seals, gorillas – the stakes are even higher. Successful males may have harems of hundreds of females, while low-ranking or weak males may never reproduce or die trying. Then there’s the issue of resources. Because they tend to be larger, sons require a lot more food than daughters and in many societies they’ll require more education and money. To produce a son capable of becoming a dominant, high-status male, parents will need to make a big investment.  View image of (Credit: Alamy) With these factors in mind, Trivers proposed that in favourable conditions, such as where the parents were high status or food was abundant, it would make evolutionary sense for parents to produce more sons. But in less favourable conditions, natural selection should favour parents who produce more daughters, since females don’t face such fierce competition. Even if they aren’t particularly attractive or socially successful, it’s likely they’ll have at least some children. “At the time I gave the joke that this was the perfect theory because it would take 20 years to prove me wrong. But 11 years later I was proved right,” says Trivers. Back in the 80s, scientists discovered that in red deer at least, dominant females have a 60% chance of giving birth to a son. But could this also be true in humans? The first evidence came from an unlikely source. In 1958, China’s ruling party announced an ambitious new project: the Great Leap Forward, which they hoped would propel the nation of peasant farmers to industrial glory in the space of a few years. Families were ordered to abandon their farms as the country prepared to step up steel production by 30%. Gardens were turned into makeshift smelting yards as possessions – from cooking pots to tractors – were melted to artificially inflate the total.  View image of (Credit: Alamy) Before long, the country was transformed – but not in the way the government had hoped. Just a year after the project began, grain output had dropped by 15%. A year after that, it dropped again. Within four years of the famine setting in, 45 million people were dead. Nearly four decades later, economist Douglas Almond found himself poring over Chinese census records to find out what had happened afterwards. But he wasn’t looking at the records of the victims – he wanted to know what life was like for their middle-aged children. Together with colleagues from Columbia University, he compared the records of those born soon after the famine with information about the province in which their parents were born. Some areas were affected more than others, so the team were able to compare the prospects of those whose mothers had gone hungry with those whose mothers had not. What they found was alarming. Though the children hadn’t experienced the famine themselves, those from famine-stricken regions were less likely to be literate, employed, self-sufficient and tended to live in smaller homes. Women tended to marry later and men were lucky to marry at all. Finally, across the whole sample, those born to affected mothers were significantly less likely to be born male in the first place. The effect even seemed to carry over to their children, who were also more likely to conceive daughters. To estimate the size of the effect, remember that worldwide there are around 109 boys born for every 100 girls. But between 1960 and 1963, the number of male children born in China fell to just 104 boys for every 100 girls, a difference of around 5% according to a later study on the famine . The ratio didn’t return to normal until 1965.

On the other end of the scale, women with more dominant personalities, a diet rich in high calorie foods (such as breakfast cereal), or married to U.S. Presidents tend to give birth to more sons. For billionaire fathers , the odds of having a boy are 65%. At this point you might be wondering why, with all these influences at work, the ratio of men to women in the world isn’t wildly unequal. Surely a disaster on the scale of the Great Chinese Famine should have produced a generation primarily of girls? According to Keith Bowers, an ecologist at the University of Memphis, there are good reasons why the population never veers too far from the gender balance. “Sons need more food than daughters, so consistently over-producing males create a more competitive family environment,” says Bowers. If all parents had sons when times were good, they may struggle to find a mate or territory when they grew up. Meanwhile, those with a genetic predisposition to over-produce daughters while everyone else is having sons would have a big advantage. “Over time you’d expect roughly equal numbers of males and females to be born,” says Bowers. According to Corry Gellatly, an evolutionary biologist at Utrecht University, this natural rebalancing may already be happening. In China, where there is a cultural preference for boys, the introduction of the one-child policy led to a substantial spike in the number of girls being aborted. As you would expect, between the 1980s and 2000s – when the policy was in full force – the majority of babies born were boys.  View image of (Credit: Alamy) But in families which had more than one child (this was allowed in certain circumstances, such as if the parents were poor farmers from the deep mountains, or if the parents themselves were only children), the firstborn child was significantly more likely to be born a girl compared to the average. This may be because parents are more likely to leave the gender of their first child up to chance – they’d care more if the second child was another girl – and with an overpopulation of boys, the odds were tipped in favour of the minority sex. Ironically, in trying so hard to have only boys, the population may have made it more likely that they would conceive a girl. Alas, this will not be able to fully rebalance the ratio of boys and girls . As of 2015, Chinese men outnumber women by 60 million. It’s been estimated that by 2030, one in four Chinese men will be unable to marry. In societies with an over-abundance of males, there may be unsavoury consequences – from higher rates of domestic violence to organised crime, to murder . Some have even suggested that this growing pool of frustrated bachelors may be attracted to the military, with the potential to trigger large-scale international conflicts. Perhaps it’s time to put the cereal away, leave your testicles alone and accept that, in the end, the chances of having a boy are – and should be – roughly 50:50. -- Join 700,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook , or follow us on Twitter , Google+ , LinkedIn and Instagram .

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Bodily proof you were almost a member of the fairer sex              By Rachael Schultz and Thinkstock     Sep 18, 2014                                        Sometimes the truth hurts, but nothing hits harder than a blow to your manhood: All guys start out, in utero, as females. “Everyone comes from a common genetic and developmental framework that is tweaked by sex hormones,” says Richard Bribiescas, Ph.D., director of the Yale Reproductive Ecology Laboratory. We all start as a generic embryo. You have a set of male or female sex chromosomes, but the distinction doesn’t kick in until your hormones enter the picture, he explains. Without hormones like testosterone, you would stay on the path to womanhood. And, sorry to say, your body already started developing by the time this decision was made—which means your lady parts were already starting to form.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    Sound crazy? We’ve got proof: Here are three visible signs that all men started out as women. YOUR NIPPLES Nipples are really just chest ornaments for men, but with the right hormones you could be a milk machine, too. Bribiescas says nipples are formed very early during embryotic development. Post-pregnancy, women produce hormones like prolactin and oxytocin that allow their nipples to fulfill their purpose—to produce milk. “Without production of these hormones, men don’t lactate, although they definitely could in the presence of these important hormones,” Bribiescas adds. YOUR PENIS During development, various hormones—including Müllerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)—are produced by males, causing the internal and external genitalia to develop differently than in females, Bribiescas explains. Because of DHT, the genital bud grows into the penis, but without this hormone, it would become the female clitoris. Meanwhile, MIS keeps the Müllerian ducts from progressing any further in men, keeping you from developing the female internal reproductive tract. So yes, that’s right: Your mountain is just a grown-up version of her valley. THAT WEIRD SEAM RUNNING DOWN YOUR SCROTUM What is that thing?!? Technically, it’s called the raphe line, and without it, you’d have a vagina. During embryotic development, everyone has an opening at their genitals. “Without male hormones, the opening remains and contributes to the development of the labia and vagina,” Bribiescas explains. When male hormones enter the picture, though, the tissue is fused together, leaving a scar that runs from your anus, over your scrotum and up the penis. Consider it a reminder of what could’ve been.

Q&A: How Soon Can You Find Out Baby's Sex?  Dr. Elizabeth Pryor answers the question, How soon can you learn: He or she? By Elizabeth Pryor, MD, FACOG from American Baby  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Ruthblack/shutterstock.com  Question How soon can I find out my baby's sex? I know you can sometimes tell by using ultrasound, but are there any other reliable methods that are used? Answer This is one of the most common questions I receive from parents-to-be. Most patients undergo an ultrasound at around 18-20 weeks (about four and a half to five months). Normally, at this stage of pregnancy we can determine the baby's sex, but not always. The position of the baby during the ultrasound is the most important aspect in our ability to tell the baby's sex, andthere's no way to influence that. For obvious reasons, it's usually easier to see if the baby is a boy. One reliable method is using amniocentesis to check the baby's chromosomes. This test is usually performed on a mother who is 35 years or older, for the purpose of identifying possible genetic problems. It involves inserting a needle into the uterus to remove a small amount of amniotic fluid. We usually do this test at around 16 weeks, so in this instance, the mother can find out the baby's sex a little sooner. This test isn't without risk, however, and isn't generally performed simply to determine the baby's sex. Boy or Girl? Find out now. Boy or Girl: How Genetics Determine Your Baby's Gender Another test that can look at the baby's chromosomes is called CVS (chorionic villus sampling), which is performed during the first trimester to look for problems with the baby's chromosomes. However, this test is infrequently used. I'm often asked if you can tell the baby's sex by the heart rate -- on the myth that one sex is faster than another -- but that is just an old wives' tale. Some people claim they can tell the baby's sex by the way you're carrying, but, again, there is no scientific proof that this is true. Still others use a "pendulum test" in which an object is suspended over the pregnant belly and the baby's sex is predicted depending on which way the pendulum swings. Again, there is no documented proof that this test works. Don't get frustrated if the doctor can't tell what the baby's sex is on ultrasound. You'll know soon enough.

Visit our community    Can you really choose the sex of your baby? For as long as we've been making babies , women have been exchanging ideas about how to increase their chances of having either a boy or a girl. Unfortunately there's no medical evidence that any of them actually work!  Having said that, there'll always be a mum who tells you an old wives' tale worked for her. So if you fancy defying the experts and trying to tip the balance towards one sex yourself, why not try some of the suggestions below.   You're more likely to conceive a boy if... You have sex on the day of ovulation , as male sperm are thought to swim faster and reach the egg first. You reach orgasm before your partner, as this releases an alkaline fluid, thought to be more male-sperm friendly than the vagina's natural acidity. You have deep penetration during sex, such as from behind (doggie-style). Your partner has a high sperm count. This is because male sperm are not as strong as female sperm, and so the higher the count, the more chance there is of a male sperm reaching the egg first. You avoid sex for a week before ovulation and then only have sex once on ovulation day, to keep the sperm count high. Your partner suggested the love-making. You make love at night. You make love on odd days of the month. Your partner keeps his genitals cool by wearing boxer shorts and loose-fitting trousers. You eat salty food, plenty of meat, fish, white flour, pasta, fresh fruit, certain vegetables, but avoid milk and dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, nuts, chocolate, shellfish and wholemeal bread. You're more likely to conceive a girl if... You have sex earlier on in your cycle, a few days before your day of ovulation. This is because female sperm are thought to be stronger and therefore last longer than male sperm, who will die off before reaching the egg. Your partner reaches orgasm before you. You have sex frequently to lower your partner's sperm count, and so increase the chances of the female sperm reaching the egg first. You keep penetration shallow. You stop having unprotected sex four to five days before ovulation, to minimise the chances of the male sperm reaching the egg first. Your partner keeps his genitals warm by wearing close-fitting underwear and tight trousers (although this isn't likely to do his general fertility any good!) You suggested the love-making. You make love in the afternoon. You make love on even days of the month. You put a wooden spoon under your bed and a pink ribbon under your pillow. You drink plenty of milk and eat dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, unsalted foods, rice, pasta, certain vegetables, mineral water, limited amounts of meat and potatoes, but avoid salt and any salty foods, wine and beer, fresh fruit, spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms, chocolate, coffee and tea. Some of these techniques are recommended as part of the Shettles method of sex selection. Find out What the scientists say about this and other methods.    Inside pregnancy: girl or boy?

I have two boys and have been blogging about wanting to have a girl for some time. I had gone through most of the experiences posted by women, like gender dieting, douching etc but they didn't really make any sense to me. Ultimately, I picked Urobiologics (based in the US) who have literally proven that, although gender is 'determined' by sperms, women select the gender of the baby based on the cycle she conceives, by choosing to conceive in the correct alternating cycle. We were given a conception plan to try to conceive in the girl cycle (you send off urine samples to Urobiologics, who will then determine when you will be in a boy or girl cycle). We became pregnant with our girl (we used their post-gender test to check the gender of the baby at around 7 weeks). Sadly our little Poppy girl died at 16 weeks (31 Oct) due to a PPROM, so we are leaving it a couple of months to heal and then go via the PreGender Preconception Test route again. I'm ready now!

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

The believe that the habits and diet of the man can also affect the ratio of male and female sperm cells he produces. They also said that certain couples are more likely to have children of one sex, and that it is more common to see families with several children of the same sex than would be expected if the odds for each child were 50/50. I've done some research and I'm not finding good evidence for any of this. Everything I'm finding indicates that meiosis in men always produces half male sperm, half female sperm, that there is no difference between them in morphology or behavior, and therefore the odds of having a boy or a girl really are 50/50. Am I right about this or is there something I am missing?        20th Apr 2010 14:55:15     Jonathan Max Berman    SUNY Buffalo  Posts: 68         Any proposed behavioral changes in parents do not have a have an affect on the gender of offspring. Families with large numbers of male or female offspring result from the "rule of large numbers." If you flip a coin enough times you  will eventually get heads five times in a row simply by chance. There are known ways of influencing the sex of a child. Female sperm are slightly heavier than male sperm due to the extra mass of the x chromosome and will tend to sink to the bottom of a test tube when centrifuged. This allows some parents using in vitro fertilization to select the sex of a child with greater accuracy than chance. Perhaps the most effective (and ethically dubious) method used by parents is selective abortion where only children of the desired gender are brought to term.        20th Apr 2010 15:43:51     Paolo Viscardi    Horniman Museum, London, UK  Posts: 1,105         Third time lucky (my other attempts have all failed to post). Males do indeed produce equal numbers of X and Y sperm. Your neighbour may be using a variant of the Shettles method that has been around since the 1970s, which works on the assumption that X and Y sperm travel at different speeds, have different longevity and are sensitive to different levels of acidity. There is little support for this theory. X and Y sperm swim at the same average speeds, although their behaviour is apparently different in variable flow conditions, probably due to the difference in mass ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6541168 ). There is some evidence that females with high energy (or possibly nutirent) intake prior to conception are slightly more likely to have male children ( http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/  /1661.full ). However, the difference is only a few percent and I can find no evidence to suggest that male nutrition or habits play any role at all.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

As males have only one X chromosome, inheriting that chromosome will mean that they will be affected by the disease. Females however, have two X chromosomes and as haemophilia is a recessive disease, two defective X chromosomes would have to be inherited for a female to be affected. In this case, the father is unaffected, and as he has to pass on a healthy X chromosome to his daughters, the probability of female offspring being affected is 0, regardless of the genotype of the mother. Any male offspring will inherit a Y chromosome from their father and an X chromosome from their mother, but there is a possibility that the mother might be a carrier (if she has both a healthy and a defective X chromosome) even though she is unaffected. If the mother is a carrier (which we don’t know in this question), the probability of a son inheriting the defective X chromosome and being affected by haemophilia is 50%.

  heterozygous for a simple Mendelian autosomal gene alpha have a child, the probability 
  that the child will show the dominant phenotype is 3/4. Let's ask
  a somewhat more complex question. If this couple has a total of four children, 
  what is the probability that 3 of the 4 will show the dominant phenotype? To 
  answer this, we will first derive the appropriate formula and then use it to 
  calculate the numerical answer. The same formula allows us to understand the 
  expected statistical distribution of the various possible phenotype patterns 
  in four-child ( or any other size) families in a large population.    1. Review: How can some simple overall probabilities be calculated 
  by combining the multiplication and addition "rules" we covered earlier?  Let's start with a very simple case: asking about gender probabilities in families 
  of three children.  What is the probability that all three children in a family will be the same 
  gender? P(all female)= 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all male ) = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 P(all one gender) = P(all female) + P(all male) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4  What is the probability that a three-child family is two girls and one boy? Each possible birth order has P=1/8. That is, P(G,G,B)=P(G,B,G)=P(B,G,G)=1/8. So, P(2G,1B)= 3/8 and P(1G,2B)= 3/8.  This allows us to write the overall gender probability distribution for families 
  of three children as follows: 1/8 will be three girls 3/8 will be two girls and one boy 3/8 will be one girl and two boys 1/8 will be three boys Adding it all up, we have 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 1 (100%)     2. How can we understand and use "Pascal's triangle" 
  and the "general rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities", 
  formula 1 (page 161 in textbook)?  Consider the numerators of the fractions in the above three-child family gender 
  equation: 1 , 3 , 3 , 1. These numbers are the coefficients in the expansion of the term 
  (p + q) cubed. In general, the coefficients of any such binomial expansion { the 
  term (p+q) raised to any power} give the "number of ways" that something 
  can happen.  Figure 4.21, "Pascal's triangle", shows these coefficients for the expansion 
  of (p + q) raised to any power up to 10. The numbers in any row can be used 
  just as described above. For example, assume that over the next two decades 
  you have 6 kids. There are 64 possible gender birth orders, with 20 of these 
  resulting in you having three girls and three boys.  The terms p and q are the individual probabilities for a specific outcome from 
  a single "event". For "gender" calculations, the probabilities p and 
  q are equal, both = 1/2 (the equal probabilities of male and female births).  For "dominant : recessive phenotype" type of calculations, p and q will usually 
  not be equal. For a simple Mendelian inheritance from two heterozygotic parents, 
  p will = 3/4 (if AA and Aa give dominant phenotype) and q will 
  = 1/4 ( aa gives recessive phenotype).  Generalizing this, we get to the formula on page 161 in your text that is "the general 
  rule for repeated trials of events with constant probabilities". The term (n!/s!t!) 
  is the number of possible ways (orders) of getting a certain net outcome ( "a 
  total of n ; with s of one and t of the other"). This 
  number can either be calculated or taken directly from Pascal's triangle.    3. Sample problem: You and your mate are both heterozygous 
  for some simple Mendelian gene alpha (i.e., each of you has genotype Aa , and both of you show the dominant phenotype) on chromosome #1. Over 
  the next decade, you proceed to have four children. What is the probability 
  that 3 of your children will show the dominant phenotype and one will show the 
  recessive phenotype? What are the probabilities of the other possible outcomes?  If we were looking at thousands of such families, we know that the overall ratio 
  of dominant to recessive phenotypes in the children would average out to 3:1, 
  as shown by a simple Punnett square. But for one couple having four children, 
  what's the probability, P(3D,1r)?  To calculate P(3D,1r), we use formula 1 for the case n=4, s=3, t=1, p=3/4, 
  q=1/4. P(3D,1r)= 4!/3! x (3/4)cubed x (1/4) = 4 x (27/64) x 1/4 = .42 ( 42% )  By also calculating the other four possibilities, we can construct a graph that shows the statistical distribution you would expect 
  to see in a large population.      Problem S-4: "Heterozygous parents; have three children".  Modify the sample problem above to do the calculations for you and your mate (both Aa ) having THREE children. Do the calculations for the probabilities that all three, two, one, or none of the three children will show the dominant phenotype from gene alpha . Construct the graph and compare the result with the "four children" graph done in class.

The 2012 (most recent available) data for England and Wales published by the UK's  Office for National Statistics shows a bias towards male births (51.3% of live births).

It could be that upon checking one single casino and a very fair, well-balanced die, the probability to get some number (say, 3) is slightly higher than $\;1/6\;$ (because of the hand throwing the dice, the table, the material the die is made of, etc.), but we usually assume some events to have "the usual, standard" probability to happen. – DonAntonio  Mar 3 '14 at 12:11        1      @DMM you could just as easily say that the probability is $50\%$ and it there was an experimental error of $2.6\%$ ;) – Guy  Mar 3 '14 at 18:47         2      @DonAntonio Except that every measurement everywhere shows that more males are born than females.

Each time you have a boy or a girl, in the next generation you can have a boy or a girl also, so the number of possibilities is doubled each generation.  In terms of your problem, when you have a boy, that represents a checkmark against "at least one of them is a boy", so I've crossed the box concerned. However all the subsequent generations after this boy are also families in which there is at least one boy, so I've crossed those out too. You can see that the chance of having at least one boy is $1/2$ in the first generation, $3/4$ in the second, and $7/8$ in the third. This generalizes to $(2^n-1)/2^n$ in the nth generation.  Conversely the chance of having no boys is $1/2$ in the first generation, $1/4$ in the second, and $1/8$ in the third. This generalizes to $1/2^n$ in the nth generation.  (Essentially I've drawn a probability tree diagram here, which generalizes to much more complicated problems).     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 4 '14 at 18:41             answered Mar 3 '14 at 14:51       TooTone   4,930 1 14 39                  Should your second-last sentence be "the chance of not having at least one boy"? – Andrew Leach  Mar 4 '14 at 18:37            @AndrewLeach thankyou, brain dzzzzt – TooTone  Mar 4 '14 at 18:39        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I’m adding an answer since I’m not reputable enough to add a comment to “lab bhattacharjee”’s answer.

Tuesday, November 08, 2016  Are large families of the same gender a statistical fluke? Mother of four sons, Gwen Loughman goes behind the myths In 1970’s Ireland, families with six or more children were the norm. CSO figures almost five decades later however, sees numbers for such families drop from 15,000 to a mere 3,000. Having four children in 21st century Ireland is considered a large family but to have more, and for those children to be all of the same gender, is a rarity and an attraction in itself.  Myths about how to conceive a girl or boy child have been around for centuries. During the reign of King Henry VIII it was widely believed the responsibility to produce the desired male gender fell to the female. Science has since proven otherwise.  Therese Murphy, lecturer in Medical Sciences, University of Exeter clears up just who determines the baby’s gender. “A baby’s genetic sex is determined by the man’s sperm as the sperm cell will contain either an X or a Y chromosome. It is the Y chromosome that is essential for the development of the male reproductive organs. When a Y chromosome is not present an embryo will develop into a female.”  Sex ratio  Carmel Kennedy, Ballyphehane, Cork with her eight sons. Carmel Kennedy from Ballyphehane, Cork with eight sons aged 37 to 20 is no stranger to people passing comments about her brood over the years. “I could talk for hours about some of the things people said. I did have girls but did not go to term with them. I always wanted a large family; I’m one of six girls and four boys and we had a beautiful childhood. Now I have eight healthy, respectful sons and lovely grand-daughters of my own,” she says. Professor Louise Kenny from Cork University Maternity Hospital Perinatal Medicine says in general, worldwide, slightly more boys are born than girls. “If left to nature there will be about 105 boys born for every 100 girls. However, 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 107 boys born for every 100 girls, largely driven by the skewed ratio caused by sex selection prior to birth in China, where about 118 boys are born for every 100 girls.” Statistical coincidence? Michelle Masterson Power and husband David have four daughters aged eight to 14. Their sons are six and four. “Because we were used to being parents of just girls, it meant we didn’t know any differently. David grew up with five sisters and one brother so he was very comfortable being a father of daughters. But once the boys came along, we learned the truth in that old saying, boys wreck the house. That one is so true! “ Michelle says her house was a very different one before the boys arrived. “It was very girly. Civilised, I’d say.” Michelle Masterson Power and Cillian, Orlagh, Ciarán, Eimear, Aoife, Ailbhe, Masterson Power. Naturally, there was great excitement when Cillian arrived, creating a particular interest in nappy changes! “The girls each took turns holding him and I had to time them! They were amazed when he wee’d all over me one day.” The odds of having a girl or a boy are the same with a one in two chance of it being one or the other. 50/50 if you like. However, what about bigger families of the same gender; are they a statistical coincidence? Dr Murphy again: “The probability of having a boy or a girl from a genetics point of view, remain the same each time a baby is conceived. However, there is some epidemiological evidence to suggest other factors may influence sex determination in humans. There is an argument about the motility and/ or survival of Y-carrying sperm and X-carrying sperm and timing of ovulation but it’s important to note that there are no robust ‘biological’ explanations for their observations to date.” There are various techniques and methods that allegedly improve the chances of conceiving a girl or a boy such as The Shettles Method and The Whelan Methods. Not forgetting particular diets and the slightly even more dubious practice of female douching. All have their believers and sceptics. Professor Louise Kenny has this to say. “In a nutshell there is no evidence that timing of intercourse affects sex ratio. There are several scientific studies that have disproven this. Furthermore, there is evidence that limiting intercourse within the fertile time will reduce your chances of getting pregnant at all. So my advice to couples would be to accept that at every conception there is approximately a 50:50 chance of conceiving a child of either sex and there’s very little than can be done to materially alter this,” she says. Historically speaking, there were massive gender divides. Concerns such as providing dowries for daughters and the birth of a male heir guaranteeing property retention saw one gender being preferred over the other. Thankfully, times have changed and when it comes to large families, issues like privacy and parental support are more relevant. Gwen Loughman with her sons Liam, Conor, Brendan, and Iarla. Carmel Kennedy had her own alternative support system in place when her boys were younger. “My sisters and I were there for each other and my sons had lots of friends and were always out playing so we mums would all stand at our gates and keep an eye on the kids. My coffee mornings were a cup of tea at the gate! And at night we called to each other’s houses.” She would agree being surrounded by menfolk meant privacy was limited. “I didn’t have any, I suppose. It’s only in the last seven years I have had my own bedroom space really as I always had a child or two asleep in my room. When they were babies and I was trying to shower, they used to scream at the door till I finished,” she says. Konrad, 26, is Carmel’s sixth-born and says life with seven brothers was for him just normal but, “for an outsider looking in it must have looked mental. It was never a silent house. We were all into music so it was loud and with eight boys comes a tonne of friends so people were always in and out. My mother was very relaxed. I think she likes the noise. I think we all turned out fairly well. We know now it was tough for my mother. But she never let it show,” he says. The teenage years are on the horizon for the Masterson Power family but Michelle is a woman of little or no fear. She feels can handle the mood swings and teenage dramas thanks to her daughters. “The girls are great with their brothers. They are very much the bosses but are also quite tolerable as the boys are much more demanding physically. Their dad grew up with sisters and has a great understanding of girls particularly in the teenage years, I think the boys will be the same.” Michelle and David encourage their children to have the same values as their parents when they grow up. “I tell the girls to find a man like their dad.”   © Irish Examiner Ltd.

In the middle ages, women believed they could swing the odds of having a son by asking their husbands to turn their faces eastwards during sex. Others disagreed – husbands should be seduced over a cocktail prepared with red wine and fresh rabbit’s womb . If that didn’t do the trick, the 18th Century French anatomist Procope-Couteau had a rather extreme measure. Men who’d “give their left testicle for a baby boy” should do exactly that, he said. He claimed the surgery was no more painful than extracting a tooth. Even today, a quick search of the internet reveals an array of exotic solutions – from vitamins to cough syrup, to changing your underwear . The more rational among us may be sure that none of it makes any difference. Each conception is a flip of the coin: there’s always an equal chance a baby will be a boy or a girl. It’s purely a matter of probability – and you can’t cheat lady luck. Yet recent research shows parents may have been inadvertently rigging the odds for thousands of years – and the true factors which make a difference are stranger than anything our superstitious ancestors could have imagined. Male mortality We now know that bad weather makes for more baby girls, as does fasting for Ramadan or suffering from morning sickness . Meanwhile mothers with dominant personalities , a taste for breakfast cereal or billionaire husbands are more likely to have baby boys. Crucially, a predisposition to having more sons or daughters is encoded in our genetics – men with more sisters tend to have girls while those with more brothers tend to have boys. What’s going on? I now see that the whole problem is so intricate that it is safer to leave its solution for the future – Charles Darwin In fact, the odds of having a boy vs. having a girl have never been exactly 50:50. Worldwide, there are around 109 boys born for every 100 girls. This might seem like a lot, but it’s necessary. Men have weaker immune systems, higher cholesterol, more heart problems, a greater susceptibility to diabetes, higher rates of cancer and lower chances of surviving it. They make up over two-thirds of murder victims, three-quarters of traffic accident fatalities and are three times more likely to commit suicide. Mothers have to have a higher proportion of sons in order for an equal number to survive.  View image of (Credit: iStock) The relative odds of conceiving sons or daughters have been baffling scientists for decades. The phenomenon was particularly mysterious to Charles Darwin, who meticulously studied the proportion of male and female offspring in a number of animals. He was convinced that the elaborate features of many male animals, such a peacock’s tail, must be a consequence of a dire shortage of the opposite sex. In these species, he figured, more competition had favoured males which stood out from the crowd. There was just one problem. In every species he studied, there were almost (but not exactly) the same number of males and females; the variation was not nearly as wide as he had expected. After failing to find any convincing evidence, eventually he abandoned the whole topic, remarking “…I now see that the whole problem is so intricate that it is safer to leave its solution for the future.” So why is the sex ratio close to 50:50, but not exactly? It was a tricky subject in need of a daring intellectual mind. Enter Robert Trivers, a renegade scientist like no other. According to his own website , he’s spent time behind bars, formed an armed gang in Jamaica to protect gay men from violence and driven a getaway car for notorious political activist Huey Newton. The Ivy League professor has been barred from university campuses, suffered mental breakdowns and broken with tradition by changing disciplines numerous times, from maths, to law, to history, to genetics. Now he’s an anthropologist at Rutgers University. “Compared to many other scientists I’ve lived a wild life,” he says.  View image of (Credit: Getty Image) Back in 1972, after tiring of history, he turned his attention to Darwin’s problem. “I said whoa – now there’s an idea worth devoting my life to,” says Trivers. Together with a colleague, Dan Willard, he developed one of the most famous theories in evolutionary biology. It’s known as the Trivers-Willard hypothesis and it goes like this. Let’s assume you can choose the sex of your children – and the game is to leave as many descendants as possible. You have a gamble to make. If your children are male, who knows, they might become the next billionaire tycoon, or US President (or both), with plenty of girlfriends to choose from. If your son is a success, it could be a big evolutionary win It’s a scientific fact that high social status is attractive to women. Fertile women prefer more dominant men and the lucky few who achieve money or influence tend to marry younger, more often and have more extra-marital affairs than their peers. If your son is a success, it could be a big evolutionary win. But if he isn’t, he may find himself unable to find a partner at all. “Because women tend to marry ‘up’ the socioeconomic scale – it’s as if women trade in their good looks to some degree – if you’re a man at the bottom of the scale you’re going to struggle to find someone to marry,” says Trivers. Females, by contrast, tend not to face such stiff competition; they have a higher chance of securing a mate and producing some offspring, even if they will never result in as many descendants as a son. That may sound a little bit sexist, but Trivers argues that it arises from the fact that a female invests more in the young, compared to a male who can just have sex and leave the childrearing to the mother. Consider the fact that the most prolific mother in world history was the nameless first wife of a peasant from Shuya, Russia, who lived from 1707 to 1782. In total, local records reveal that she gave birth to 69 children, which is nothing compared to the warrior Genghis Khan, who fathered between 1,000 and 2,000 children before he died in 1227. Today, he’s thought to have around 16 million great, great, ... great grandsons. And Khan is not the only one; a recent DNA analysis revealed at least 10 men from history who have left a legacy comparable with Khan’s, including a Chinese ruler who died in 1582, and the originator of the medieval Uí Néill dynasty in Ireland. In many animals – red deer, elephant seals, gorillas – the stakes are even higher. Successful males may have harems of hundreds of females, while low-ranking or weak males may never reproduce or die trying. Then there’s the issue of resources. Because they tend to be larger, sons require a lot more food than daughters and in many societies they’ll require more education and money. To produce a son capable of becoming a dominant, high-status male, parents will need to make a big investment.  View image of (Credit: Alamy) With these factors in mind, Trivers proposed that in favourable conditions, such as where the parents were high status or food was abundant, it would make evolutionary sense for parents to produce more sons. But in less favourable conditions, natural selection should favour parents who produce more daughters, since females don’t face such fierce competition. Even if they aren’t particularly attractive or socially successful, it’s likely they’ll have at least some children. “At the time I gave the joke that this was the perfect theory because it would take 20 years to prove me wrong. But 11 years later I was proved right,” says Trivers. Back in the 80s, scientists discovered that in red deer at least, dominant females have a 60% chance of giving birth to a son. But could this also be true in humans? The first evidence came from an unlikely source. In 1958, China’s ruling party announced an ambitious new project: the Great Leap Forward, which they hoped would propel the nation of peasant farmers to industrial glory in the space of a few years. Families were ordered to abandon their farms as the country prepared to step up steel production by 30%. Gardens were turned into makeshift smelting yards as possessions – from cooking pots to tractors – were melted to artificially inflate the total.  View image of (Credit: Alamy) Before long, the country was transformed – but not in the way the government had hoped. Just a year after the project began, grain output had dropped by 15%. A year after that, it dropped again. Within four years of the famine setting in, 45 million people were dead. Nearly four decades later, economist Douglas Almond found himself poring over Chinese census records to find out what had happened afterwards. But he wasn’t looking at the records of the victims – he wanted to know what life was like for their middle-aged children. Together with colleagues from Columbia University, he compared the records of those born soon after the famine with information about the province in which their parents were born. Some areas were affected more than others, so the team were able to compare the prospects of those whose mothers had gone hungry with those whose mothers had not. What they found was alarming. Though the children hadn’t experienced the famine themselves, those from famine-stricken regions were less likely to be literate, employed, self-sufficient and tended to live in smaller homes. Women tended to marry later and men were lucky to marry at all. Finally, across the whole sample, those born to affected mothers were significantly less likely to be born male in the first place. The effect even seemed to carry over to their children, who were also more likely to conceive daughters. To estimate the size of the effect, remember that worldwide there are around 109 boys born for every 100 girls. But between 1960 and 1963, the number of male children born in China fell to just 104 boys for every 100 girls, a difference of around 5% according to a later study on the famine . The ratio didn’t return to normal until 1965.

On the other end of the scale, women with more dominant personalities, a diet rich in high calorie foods (such as breakfast cereal), or married to U.S. Presidents tend to give birth to more sons. For billionaire fathers , the odds of having a boy are 65%. At this point you might be wondering why, with all these influences at work, the ratio of men to women in the world isn’t wildly unequal. Surely a disaster on the scale of the Great Chinese Famine should have produced a generation primarily of girls? According to Keith Bowers, an ecologist at the University of Memphis, there are good reasons why the population never veers too far from the gender balance. “Sons need more food than daughters, so consistently over-producing males create a more competitive family environment,” says Bowers. If all parents had sons when times were good, they may struggle to find a mate or territory when they grew up. Meanwhile, those with a genetic predisposition to over-produce daughters while everyone else is having sons would have a big advantage. “Over time you’d expect roughly equal numbers of males and females to be born,” says Bowers. According to Corry Gellatly, an evolutionary biologist at Utrecht University, this natural rebalancing may already be happening. In China, where there is a cultural preference for boys, the introduction of the one-child policy led to a substantial spike in the number of girls being aborted. As you would expect, between the 1980s and 2000s – when the policy was in full force – the majority of babies born were boys.

This may be because parents are more likely to leave the gender of their first child up to chance – they’d care more if the second child was another girl – and with an overpopulation of boys, the odds were tipped in favour of the minority sex. Ironically, in trying so hard to have only boys, the population may have made it more likely that they would conceive a girl. Alas, this will not be able to fully rebalance the ratio of boys and girls . As of 2015, Chinese men outnumber women by 60 million. It’s been estimated that by 2030, one in four Chinese men will be unable to marry. In societies with an over-abundance of males, there may be unsavoury consequences – from higher rates of domestic violence to organised crime, to murder . Some have even suggested that this growing pool of frustrated bachelors may be attracted to the military, with the potential to trigger large-scale international conflicts. Perhaps it’s time to put the cereal away, leave your testicles alone and accept that, in the end, the chances of having a boy are – and should be – roughly 50:50. -- Join 700,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook , or follow us on Twitter , Google+ , LinkedIn and Instagram .
