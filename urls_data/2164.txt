She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.  “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.  “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

(January 2013)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     See also: Southpaw stance  Interactive sports such as table tennis, badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness, while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation. Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

Being a righty or a lefty could be linked to variations in a network of genes that influence right or left asymmetries in the body and brain  President Barack Obama is left-handed, as well as at least six former presidents. (Wikimedia Commons)    By Natasha Geiling    smithsonian.com   September 12, 2013         For the left-handed people of the world, life isn’t easy. Throughout much of history, massive stigmas attached to left-handedness meant they were singled out as everything from unclean to witches . In Medieval times, writing with your left-hand was a surefire way to be accused of being possessed by the devil ; after all, the devil himself was thought to be a lefty. The world has gotten progressively more accepting of left-handed folk, but there are still some undeniable bummers associated with a left-handed proclivity: desks and spiral notebooks pose a constant battle, scissors are all but impossible to use and–according to some studies–life-expectancy might be lower than for right-handed people .    What makes humanity’s bias against lefties all the more unfair is that left-handed people are born that way. In fact, scientists have speculated for years that a single gene could control a left-right preference in humans. Unfortunately, they just couldn’t pinpoint exactly where the gene might lie.  Now, in a paper published today in PLOS Genetics a group of researchers have identified a network of genes that relate to handedness in humans. What’s more, they’ve linked this preference to the development of asymmetry in the body and the brain.  In previous studies, the researchers observed that patients with dyslexia exhibited a correlation between the gene PCSK6 and handedness. Because every gene has two copies (known as alleles), every gene has two chances for mutation; what the researches found was that dyslexic patients with more variance in PCSK6–meaning that one or both of their PSCK6 alleles had mutated–were more likely to be right-handed.  The research team found this especially interesting, because they knew that PCSK6 was a gene directly associated with the development of left-right asymmetry in the body. They weren’t sure why this would present itself only in dyslexic patients, as dyslexia and handedness are not related. So the team expanded the study to include more than 2,600 people who don’t have dyslexia.  The study found that PCSK6 didn’t work alone in affecting handedness in the general population. Other genes, also responsible for creating left-right asymmetry in the body, were strongly associated with handedness. Like PCSK6, the effect that these genes have on handedness depends on how many mutations the alleles undergo. Each gene has the potential for mutation–the more mutations a person has in any one direction (toward right handedness or left handedness) the more likely they are to use that hand as their dominant hand, or so the researchers speculate.  The hypothesis is a logical response to a key question: If handedness is genetic and if right-handedness is such a dominant trait, why hasn’t left-handedness been forced out of the genetic pool? In reality, the research suggests that handedness could be more subtle than simple “dominant” or “recessive” traits–a whole host of genes might play significant roles.  What’s especially exciting is that these genes all relate to the development of left-right asymmetry in the body and brain, creating a strong case for correlation between the development of this symmetry and the development of handedness. Disrupting any of these genes could lead to serious physical asymmetry, like situs inversus , a condition where the body’s organs are reversed (heart on the right side of the body, for example). In mice, the disruption of PCSK6 resulted in serious abnormal positioning of organs in their bodies.   If physical asymmetry is related to handedness, then people with situs inversus should favor one hand more often than what you’d find in the general population. Studies show that this isn’t the case–individuals with this condition mirror the general population’s split in handedness–leading the researchers to postulate that while these genes certainly influence handedness, there might be other mechanisms in the body that compensate for handedness in the event of major physiological asymmetries.  Other animals, such as polar bears or chimpanzees , also have handedness–chimpanzees have been known to prefer one hand to the other when using tools or looking for food, but the split within a population hangs around 50/50 . Humans are the only species that show a truly distinct bias toward one hand or the other: a 90/10 right/left split throughout the population.  One predominant hypothesis for this bias relates to another distinct human trait: language ability. Language ability is split between the different hemispheres of the brain, much like handedness, which suggests that handedness became compartmentalized along with language ability, For most, the parts of the brain that govern language are are present in the left-side of the brain–these people tend to be right-handed. The few that have language skills focused in the right side of the brain tend to be left-handed.  However, William Brandler, a PhD student at Oxford University and the paper’s lead author, isn’t convinced that this theory holds much stock, as correlations between language and handedness in research aren’t well established. Brandler is more interested in learning how the permutations and combinations of genetic mutations play into humans’ likelihood to be right-handed. “Through understanding the genetics of handedness, we might be able to understand how it evolved,” he says. “Once we have the full picture of all the genes involved, and how they interact with other genes, we might be able to understand how and why there is such a bias.”  And he’s confident that even if environmental factors (like the continued hatred of lefties by two-thirds of the world ) place pressure on handedness, any baseline bias still boils down to genetics. “People think it’s just an environmental thing, but you’ve got to think, why is there that initial bias in the first place, and why do you see that bias across all societies? Why aren’t there societies where you see a bias to the left?” Brandler asks. “There is a genetic component to handedness, hundreds of different genetic variants, and each one might push you one way or the other, and it’s the type of variance, along with the environment you’re in and the pressures acting on you, which affect your handedness.”  But until a larger population can be tested–hundreds of thousands, by Brandler’s estimates–a full genetic map of what controls handedness and why our population isn’t evenly split between righties and lefties can’t be determined. “It’s going to take a bit of time before these materialize—but it will happen,” Brandler says. “There’s been a whole revolution in genetics such that, in a few years time, we’re really going to start to understand the genetic basis of complex traits.”     Like this article?

This article was written by Keith Milsom, owner of Anything Left-Handed, in response to lots of questions from Left Handers Club members.  About 10% of the world's population are left-handed and it seems that left-handedness runs in families, with the handedness of the mother being an important factor.  So what are the chances of having a left-handed child?  Various studies have shown that around 10% of the world's population are naturally left-handed and that this seems to be a fairly consistent figure over a long period of time and in all countries and cultures.  The way left-handedness is measured and the fact that many cultures deliberately suppress left-handedness complicate the picture, but left-handedness seems to stay at about that level anyway.  More recent studies among children show a higher level,  may be increasing.  It also seems to run in families, although no gene for left-handedness has been isolated and it is not possible to predict left-handedness in the same way as, say, eye colour. What we do know is that the more left-handers you have in the family, the more chance of having left-handed children.  The probabilities of various left-right parent combinations having a left-handed child vary quite a lot depending on which research you look at.  Dr Chris McManus reported in his book Left Hand, Right Hand on a study he had done based on a review of scientific literature which showed parent handedness for 70,000 children.  On average, the chances of two right-handed parents having a left-handed child were around 9% left-handed children, two left-handed parents around 26% and one left and one right-handed parent around 19%.  In The Left-Handers Handbook, Diane Paul, repeated this and also noted that Left-handed mothers are more likely to have left-handed children than left-handed fathers.  This was based on research done by Stanley Coren for his book The Left Hander Syndrome, where he showed the chances of  two right-handed parents having a left-handed child were around 10%, a right-handed mother and left-handed father the same, 10%, left-handed mother and right-handed father 20% and two left-handed parents 35%.  A large survey carried out by Anything Left-Handed showed that only 1.4% of left-handers who responded had two left-handed parent, 24% had one left-handed parent and 75% had two right-handed parents.  Are all these numbers consistent with each other?  If those percentages are true, would the level of left-handedness in the population as a whole stay at a consistent level?  I have produced a model that calculates the mix of handedness in parents and then multiples by the assumed probabilities for each mix having left-handed children to calculate the total number of left-handed children and their percentage of the population.  For example, if 10% of the population is left-handed, only 1% of all couples will be made up of two left-handers (like me an my wife, but there is a theory that left-handers attract each other which would distort this, but that is for another article!).  Putting Chris McManus's percentages into the model shows an increase from 10% to 11.5% in the level of left-handedness in the population in one generation and if that continued for very long left-handers would no longer be in the minority!  Stanley Coren's figures, although quite different, also give an increase in left-handedness to 11.2% and neither of them give a match to the figures from the Anything Left-Handed survey.  Most significantly, the number of left-handed children with two left-handed parents is 2.3% for McManus and 3.1% for Coren.  To get down to the level of only 1.4% found in the Anything Left-Handed survey, the chances of two left-handed parents having a left-handed child need to be reduced to around 14% - much closer to the other parent mixes.  Juggling the figures to get the best match to all these results, plus also keeping the level of left-handedness stable at around 10%, these probabilities of having a left-handed child seem to fit:  Two right handed parents, 9% Left handed father, 12% Left handed mother, 16% Two left handed parents, 20%  There are many more variables that affect these figures and one study showed that left-handers have less children on average that right handers. This is meant to be a guide rather than a scientific conclusion.  However, whichever set of assumptions you use, some interesting figures come out:  *  More than 50% of left-handers do not know of any other left-hander anywhere in their living family.  *  Around 75% of left-handers have two right-handed parents and only 2% have two left-handed parents.  *  Between 7 and 8 out of 10 children born to two left handed parent will be right handed.  Of course, the chances of having a left-hander in the family increase the more children you have.  So there is still hope for right-handed parents - if you have enough children, you may still be lucky enough to have a left-hander!

She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .     Contents    1  Types  2  Causes   2.1  Division of labor  2.2  Genetic factors  2.3  Epigenetic factors  2.4  Prenatal hormone exposure  2.5  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry  2.6  Ultrasound    3  Handedness developmental timeline  4  Correlation with other factors   4.1  Intelligence   4.1.1  Early childhood intelligence    4.2  Health  4.3  Income  4.4  Left-handedness and sports  4.5  Gender  4.6  Sexuality and gender identity    5  In culture   5.1  Negative appeal  5.2  International Left-Handers Day    6  In other animals  7  See also  8  Sources  9  External links     Types [ edit ]   Right-handedness is most common. Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

Election Odds: The 2012 U.S. Presidential Election  Episode 1: Introducing The “What Are The Odds?” Podcast                      What Are The Odds Of Being Left-Handed?     Health             The odds of being left-handed are about 10%. Men’s odds of being left-handed are approximately 1.23 times greater than women’s, according to a meta-analysis of 144 studies.   The small size of the left-handed population has been so stable through millennia that even the archaeological record bears out the rough proportion of left-handed individuals; ancient cave paintings and archaic weapons indicate that left-handed people have existed as a small minority as far back as the early days of human history. However, despite our general familiarity with how few people are left-handed, left-handedness continues to mystify us. Historically, left-handers have frequently been maligned, and today, although attitudes towards left-handedness have generally softened, what it means to be left-handed is often misunderstood and some aspects of left-handedness remain a mystery altogether.   Because the trait was generally looked down upon in Western society, people attempted to force left-handed children to use their right hands until relatively recently. Left-handed people were sometimes considered either defective, evil or both. Stories abound of parents punishing their children for using their left hands or even tying up the left hand to prevent its use. For some, views of left-handedness veered beyond superstition into the realm of pseudoscience. For instance, Cesare Lombroso, a late 19th century Italian physician and criminologist, viewed left-handedness as evidence of a biological regression to primitiveness and furthermore, he regarded this physical characteristic as a basis for distinguishing criminals from noncriminals.  Today: Left-Handedness the Upper Hand?  On the one hand, so to speak, views of left-handedness have improved dramatically over the years. On the other hand, there is still a so much that we just don’t understand about left-handedness. Ironically, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction when it comes to popular views on handedness and intelligence. Many people believe that left-handers are generally more intelligent than the rest of the population, yet when it comes to IQ, studies have shown that left-handers have only a one point edge over right-handed people. Moreover, from a genetic perspective, an Oxford University study found that the gene associated with left-handedness, LRRTM1, is also associated with dyslexia and increased risk for developing schizophrenia.  Nonetheless, left-handers’ brains do appear to process information differently, processing information across the hemispheres more readily than do right-handers’, a tendency that is thought to be linked to increased creativity and a stronger grasp of spacial relationships. Additionally, a greater number of left-handed individuals than right-handeders demonstrate exceptional ability in mathematics as well as music, as is attested in a study that found a larger proportion of gifted left-handed musicians in professional orchestras as well as studies that revealed a high number of left-handers among students taking tests assessing mathematical giftedness. Left-handedness may also be advantageous in  both one-one-one competitive sports (such as boxing and tennis) and one-on-one combat;  while left-handers have a great deal of experience with right-handed opponents, right-handers do not have very much experience with left-handers.

Uncategorized          Back to Uncategorized           English   Español       I'm just curious about the genetics of handedness.  Both of my parents are left-handed, both myself and my brother are right-handed.  My husband and I are both right-handed and we have 2 children, one's a lefty and one's a righty.  My husband's parents are both righties.  It's just something I've always wondered about since we studied genetics in 6th grade and the teacher told us that handedness was Mendelian like eye color, but couldn't explain why I'm a righty (no doubt wondering if maybe I was adopted, which I wasn't, lol!)       -A curious adult from Florida Your teacher was close in that handedness is like eye color.  Except that what makes them similar is that neither is a simple Mendelian trait.  A simple Mendelian trait is one where there is a dominant and a recessive gene.  Remember, we have 2 copies of most of our genes—one from mom and one from dad.  If some version of a gene is dominant, then you only need one copy of that version to see a trait.  For example, let's say that the right hand gene was dominant over the left hand gene.  You'd be right-handed with either one or two copies of the right hand gene.  To be left-handed, both copies would have to be the left hand gene.  So if two lefties had a baby, the baby should turn out left-handed.  This is not the case for your family or lots of others either.  When people have looked at handedness, it just doesn't follow simple rules.  For example, if both parents are right-handed, there is a 1 in 10 chance of having a left-handed child.  The same is true if the dad is left-handed.  If the mother is left-handed, the odds rise to 2 in 10. And if both parents are left-handed, the child has a 4 in 10 chance of being left-handed.  If a classic dominant-recessive model were in play, then left-handed people would only have left handed kids.  But they don't even have left-handed kids most of the time!  What's going on here is that genes aren't the whole story.  The best evidence that something besides genes are involved comes from looking at identical twins.  Remember, identical twins start out with exactly the same DNA.  If something is completely determined by genetics, then if one identical twin has it, the other in the pair should as well. When one twin is left handed, the other twin is left handed only 76% of the time.  Clearly genes aren't enough.  So, what else is involved?  Most likely, the environment plays a role.  There are probably one or more genes that make you more likely to become left-handed.  You then need some sort of environmental trigger for it to happen.  This is what happens with, for example, juvenile diabetes.  Scientists believe that not everyone who has the genes necessary for diabetes get it.  A current theory is that you need certain genes and a viral infection to get the body to attack its own pancreas and give itself diabetes.  But is there any evidence for a trigger with handedness?  I couldn't find much research in people, but some interesting studies have been done with chimpanzees.  In chimpanzees, being right handed is about twice as common as being left handed (as opposed to around 9 times as likely in humans).  When scientists studied chimpanzees, they found that the chances for having a left-handed baby increased significantly based on birth order.  The first and sixth or later babies had a much higher chance of being left-handed than did the middle ones.  What do the first and later pregnancies have in common?  They tend to have hormonal variations that don't happen with the middle pregnancies.  And this might be the environmental trigger we're looking for.  There is some evidence in humans that birth order may play a role as well.  Nothing as clear-cut as we see with chimps but we do know that older mothers tend to have more left handed children.  Also, at least with boys, some studies have shown that later kids are more likely to be left-handed.  So, handedness is most likely due to a combination of genes and environment.  Some people have a greater chance of being left-handed but something needs to trigger it.  Remember, the identical twin story argued against genes being the whole story.  It also argues that birth order isn't everything either. If it were, then if one identical twin was a lefty, the other would always be one as well.  Birth order might be one trigger but there must be others as well.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.  “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.  “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

August 25, 2016 / 21 Comments / in Being Left Handed  / by Neal What percentage of people are left handed? Ever signed for a delivery and had the driver ask if you’re a lefty? Apparently we’re still that much of a rarity that people feel the need to point it out to us every time they notice. I’m not having a go, I do it myself. All the time… Last week at work the purchasing team ordered a bunch of Fender merchandise, including ( for some reason! ) this ridiculous anime lunchbox . Rather than asking why in the hell we were stocking a Fender lunchbox (like everyone else in the office), I proudly pointed out that the girl on the front was playing a left handed guitar. So apparently it’s still a novelty even to me . A guy who is left handed, plays guitar lefty, and runs a lefty guitar website … What makes for the fascination? Just how many people are left handed exactly ? Check out the handy, dandy infographic below (click to enlarge!), or keep reading to find out. What Percentage of People are Left Handed? Roughly 12% of the world is left handed. This figure is averaged from studies undertaken in North America and Western Europe. In these developed countries being left handed is less likely to be discouraged due to social stigmas, which should result in a less skewed overall number. Although it should be noted that left handed discrimination does still occur in these countries, such as this well publicised example in the USA in 2015. Right Handed (~87%) . I’m sure you didn’t come to this article unaware that right handed people make up the majority of the population. It is estimated that right handed people amount to roughly 87% of the world. Left Handed (~12%) . The second most common handedness type, studies show that on average us lefties make up around 12% of the population. Although this does vary depending on location, as in some countries being left handed may still have a social stigma attached to it. For example Taiwan (5%), Japan (4.7%), and Korea (2%) all have a much lower population of lefties. Scroll down a little further to see the lefty representation broken down by country. Ambidextrous (<1%) . An ambidextrous person is able to perform any task equally well with either hand, although they do still tend to favor their dominant side. Truly ambidextrous people are incredibly rare, and are estimated to make up less than 1% of the population. Ambivelous (<1%) . An ambivelous (or ambisinister) person is the exact opposite of an ambidextrous person, finding it generally awkward to use either hand to undertake tasks. Age is a Factor Even until recently, being left handed was still discouraged in many developed countries. We can see this when we look at the number of lefties in different age groups in North America. Only 6% of over-65s identified as being left handed, whereas a whopping 15% of under 30s said the same. Check out the graph below which shows the percentage of lefties broken down by year. These results were taken from a large study by Gilbert and Wysocki ( Hand Preference and Age in the United States , 1992) which included over 1 million people. The increased number of people identifying as being left handed is almost certainly due to modern society becoming less conservative. On top of this, it is estimated that amongst older generations some 6-8% of right handed people are actually natural left handers , but were forced into writing right handed due to social pressures. Considering the results based on age, it would seem very likely that the overall percentage of people identifying as being a lefty will continue to increase over time. How Many People Are Left Handed In Other Parts of the World? The figures above are taken from a select few countries, but what about the rest of the world? Check out the graphic below to find out! Data for European countries was taken from a large internet study by McManus and Peters ( Handedness in Europe: analysis of data from the BBC internet study ). Information on other countries was sourced from various other bodies of research. It’s clear that in countries with a more formal culture, the rate of left-handedness is much lower. It has been suggested that the more complex writing style in many Asian countries is a major reason why the numbers are so much lower. Men Versus Women Lefties are not created equally! According to a 2008 study ( Sex Differences in Left-Handedness: A Meta-Analysis of 144 Studies ), a left handed person is 23% more likely to be male than female . This means that for every 4 left handed women, there should be roughly 5 left handed men. One possible explanation for this uneven split is that girls are more likely to conform to social norms. It has also been suggested that there may be genetic factors, which you can read about below. The Chances of Having a Left Handed Child According to a 2009 study by Llaurens, Raymond and Faurie ( Why are some people left-handed? An evolutionary perspective ), the chances of having a left handed child are as follows: Both parents Left Handed – 27% Male / 21.4% Female Righty Father & Lefty Mother – 22.1% Male / 21.7% Female Lefty Father & Righty Mother – 18.2% Male / 15.3% Female Both Parents Right Handed – 10.4% Male / 8.5% Female I’ve averaged these results out for simplicity and displayed them in the graphic below. Another interesting factoid I stumbled across was that two left handed parents are twice as likely to produce twins! Is There A Place Where 100% of People Are Lefties? Yes!

She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.  “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.  “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

(January 2013)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     See also: Southpaw stance  Interactive sports such as table tennis, badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness, while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation. Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

Being a righty or a lefty could be linked to variations in a network of genes that influence right or left asymmetries in the body and brain  President Barack Obama is left-handed, as well as at least six former presidents. (Wikimedia Commons)    By Natasha Geiling    smithsonian.com   September 12, 2013         For the left-handed people of the world, life isn’t easy. Throughout much of history, massive stigmas attached to left-handedness meant they were singled out as everything from unclean to witches . In Medieval times, writing with your left-hand was a surefire way to be accused of being possessed by the devil ; after all, the devil himself was thought to be a lefty. The world has gotten progressively more accepting of left-handed folk, but there are still some undeniable bummers associated with a left-handed proclivity: desks and spiral notebooks pose a constant battle, scissors are all but impossible to use and–according to some studies–life-expectancy might be lower than for right-handed people .    What makes humanity’s bias against lefties all the more unfair is that left-handed people are born that way. In fact, scientists have speculated for years that a single gene could control a left-right preference in humans. Unfortunately, they just couldn’t pinpoint exactly where the gene might lie.  Now, in a paper published today in PLOS Genetics a group of researchers have identified a network of genes that relate to handedness in humans. What’s more, they’ve linked this preference to the development of asymmetry in the body and the brain.  In previous studies, the researchers observed that patients with dyslexia exhibited a correlation between the gene PCSK6 and handedness. Because every gene has two copies (known as alleles), every gene has two chances for mutation; what the researches found was that dyslexic patients with more variance in PCSK6–meaning that one or both of their PSCK6 alleles had mutated–were more likely to be right-handed.  The research team found this especially interesting, because they knew that PCSK6 was a gene directly associated with the development of left-right asymmetry in the body. They weren’t sure why this would present itself only in dyslexic patients, as dyslexia and handedness are not related. So the team expanded the study to include more than 2,600 people who don’t have dyslexia.  The study found that PCSK6 didn’t work alone in affecting handedness in the general population. Other genes, also responsible for creating left-right asymmetry in the body, were strongly associated with handedness. Like PCSK6, the effect that these genes have on handedness depends on how many mutations the alleles undergo. Each gene has the potential for mutation–the more mutations a person has in any one direction (toward right handedness or left handedness) the more likely they are to use that hand as their dominant hand, or so the researchers speculate.  The hypothesis is a logical response to a key question: If handedness is genetic and if right-handedness is such a dominant trait, why hasn’t left-handedness been forced out of the genetic pool? In reality, the research suggests that handedness could be more subtle than simple “dominant” or “recessive” traits–a whole host of genes might play significant roles.  What’s especially exciting is that these genes all relate to the development of left-right asymmetry in the body and brain, creating a strong case for correlation between the development of this symmetry and the development of handedness. Disrupting any of these genes could lead to serious physical asymmetry, like situs inversus , a condition where the body’s organs are reversed (heart on the right side of the body, for example). In mice, the disruption of PCSK6 resulted in serious abnormal positioning of organs in their bodies.   If physical asymmetry is related to handedness, then people with situs inversus should favor one hand more often than what you’d find in the general population. Studies show that this isn’t the case–individuals with this condition mirror the general population’s split in handedness–leading the researchers to postulate that while these genes certainly influence handedness, there might be other mechanisms in the body that compensate for handedness in the event of major physiological asymmetries.  Other animals, such as polar bears or chimpanzees , also have handedness–chimpanzees have been known to prefer one hand to the other when using tools or looking for food, but the split within a population hangs around 50/50 . Humans are the only species that show a truly distinct bias toward one hand or the other: a 90/10 right/left split throughout the population.  One predominant hypothesis for this bias relates to another distinct human trait: language ability. Language ability is split between the different hemispheres of the brain, much like handedness, which suggests that handedness became compartmentalized along with language ability, For most, the parts of the brain that govern language are are present in the left-side of the brain–these people tend to be right-handed. The few that have language skills focused in the right side of the brain tend to be left-handed.  However, William Brandler, a PhD student at Oxford University and the paper’s lead author, isn’t convinced that this theory holds much stock, as correlations between language and handedness in research aren’t well established. Brandler is more interested in learning how the permutations and combinations of genetic mutations play into humans’ likelihood to be right-handed. “Through understanding the genetics of handedness, we might be able to understand how it evolved,” he says. “Once we have the full picture of all the genes involved, and how they interact with other genes, we might be able to understand how and why there is such a bias.”  And he’s confident that even if environmental factors (like the continued hatred of lefties by two-thirds of the world ) place pressure on handedness, any baseline bias still boils down to genetics. “People think it’s just an environmental thing, but you’ve got to think, why is there that initial bias in the first place, and why do you see that bias across all societies? Why aren’t there societies where you see a bias to the left?” Brandler asks. “There is a genetic component to handedness, hundreds of different genetic variants, and each one might push you one way or the other, and it’s the type of variance, along with the environment you’re in and the pressures acting on you, which affect your handedness.”  But until a larger population can be tested–hundreds of thousands, by Brandler’s estimates–a full genetic map of what controls handedness and why our population isn’t evenly split between righties and lefties can’t be determined. “It’s going to take a bit of time before these materialize—but it will happen,” Brandler says. “There’s been a whole revolution in genetics such that, in a few years time, we’re really going to start to understand the genetic basis of complex traits.”     Like this article?

This article was written by Keith Milsom, owner of Anything Left-Handed, in response to lots of questions from Left Handers Club members.  About 10% of the world's population are left-handed and it seems that left-handedness runs in families, with the handedness of the mother being an important factor.  So what are the chances of having a left-handed child?  Various studies have shown that around 10% of the world's population are naturally left-handed and that this seems to be a fairly consistent figure over a long period of time and in all countries and cultures.  The way left-handedness is measured and the fact that many cultures deliberately suppress left-handedness complicate the picture, but left-handedness seems to stay at about that level anyway.  More recent studies among children show a higher level,  may be increasing.  It also seems to run in families, although no gene for left-handedness has been isolated and it is not possible to predict left-handedness in the same way as, say, eye colour. What we do know is that the more left-handers you have in the family, the more chance of having left-handed children.  The probabilities of various left-right parent combinations having a left-handed child vary quite a lot depending on which research you look at.  Dr Chris McManus reported in his book Left Hand, Right Hand on a study he had done based on a review of scientific literature which showed parent handedness for 70,000 children.  On average, the chances of two right-handed parents having a left-handed child were around 9% left-handed children, two left-handed parents around 26% and one left and one right-handed parent around 19%.  In The Left-Handers Handbook, Diane Paul, repeated this and also noted that Left-handed mothers are more likely to have left-handed children than left-handed fathers.  This was based on research done by Stanley Coren for his book The Left Hander Syndrome, where he showed the chances of  two right-handed parents having a left-handed child were around 10%, a right-handed mother and left-handed father the same, 10%, left-handed mother and right-handed father 20% and two left-handed parents 35%.  A large survey carried out by Anything Left-Handed showed that only 1.4% of left-handers who responded had two left-handed parent, 24% had one left-handed parent and 75% had two right-handed parents.  Are all these numbers consistent with each other?  If those percentages are true, would the level of left-handedness in the population as a whole stay at a consistent level?  I have produced a model that calculates the mix of handedness in parents and then multiples by the assumed probabilities for each mix having left-handed children to calculate the total number of left-handed children and their percentage of the population.  For example, if 10% of the population is left-handed, only 1% of all couples will be made up of two left-handers (like me an my wife, but there is a theory that left-handers attract each other which would distort this, but that is for another article!).  Putting Chris McManus's percentages into the model shows an increase from 10% to 11.5% in the level of left-handedness in the population in one generation and if that continued for very long left-handers would no longer be in the minority!  Stanley Coren's figures, although quite different, also give an increase in left-handedness to 11.2% and neither of them give a match to the figures from the Anything Left-Handed survey.  Most significantly, the number of left-handed children with two left-handed parents is 2.3% for McManus and 3.1% for Coren.  To get down to the level of only 1.4% found in the Anything Left-Handed survey, the chances of two left-handed parents having a left-handed child need to be reduced to around 14% - much closer to the other parent mixes.  Juggling the figures to get the best match to all these results, plus also keeping the level of left-handedness stable at around 10%, these probabilities of having a left-handed child seem to fit:  Two right handed parents, 9% Left handed father, 12% Left handed mother, 16% Two left handed parents, 20%  There are many more variables that affect these figures and one study showed that left-handers have less children on average that right handers. This is meant to be a guide rather than a scientific conclusion.  However, whichever set of assumptions you use, some interesting figures come out:  *  More than 50% of left-handers do not know of any other left-hander anywhere in their living family.  *  Around 75% of left-handers have two right-handed parents and only 2% have two left-handed parents.  *  Between 7 and 8 out of 10 children born to two left handed parent will be right handed.  Of course, the chances of having a left-hander in the family increase the more children you have.  So there is still hope for right-handed parents - if you have enough children, you may still be lucky enough to have a left-hander!

She comes from a  long line of them. She, along with her father, brother, sister and aunt are all  proud southpaws. "If the left  hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right  hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body, you know we're the  only ones in our right mind," she said. "That must be  lefty humor," I said. From doors,  computers, to scissors, there is no doubt that our world is made for  right-handed people. Even anthropologists, have found that right-hand preference  spans across all human cultures, including ancient civilizations. Even a test of  fetuses (using ultrasound) shows 92 percent sucking their right thumbs,  according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto. In fact, about 1  in 10 people are left-handed, according to the latest research. Also,  left-handedness tends to be more common in men than in  women. Being a lefty is also a family affair. A Scientific American Mind article states  that two-right handed parents have a 9.5 percent chance of having a left-handed  child. A mixed couple, with one lefty and one righty, have about double those  chances. Whereas, two left-handed mates have a 26 percent chance of having a  southpaw baby. Just last month,  Oxford University researchers  discovered a gene that increases the odds of being left-handed. That same gene  may carry an increased risk of schizophrenia.  It's yet another finding that  associates left-handedness with poorer health outcomes. A Dutch study  this year found that left-handed women have a  higher risk for cancer, stroke and arterial damage. Some  older studies have found associations with a long list of chronic ailments:   alcoholism, dyslexia, migraine, asthma, hyperactivity, inflammatory bowel  disease and mental disabilities. But even with these higher associated rates, no  scientist can offer a definitive cause and effect between left-handedness and  illness. Critics of older  studies say that the research is biased.  They say it has been influenced by  antiquated theories based on left-handedness as a disorder - a product of an  excess of fetal testosterone or developmental instability in the uterus. The  latest research says there is little to no proof of these factors being true. There is some  good news. Last year, an Australian study found that left-handed people are  quicker while playing computer games and sports. Do you think that  left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's  easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world?   Posted By A. Chris Gajilan, Senior Producer, Medical News: 9:30 AM ET  44 Comments   Add a comment    Being a left-handed only caused me a couple of problems. One, from first grade all the way through college there were NO left handed desks. Remember the desks that provided a comfortable place to rest your writing arm? Lefties don't. Second it was harder to learn to knit;not impossible just a little harder. Because lefties learn how to try a little harder....  Posted By  Julie : 10:15 AM ET     My left handedness made playing video games a lot easier for the longest time. But now with the Wii, many games are being made for the right hander in mind, forcing me to keep my right arm at attention as I blast away foes or swing my sword. This does not mean I will become average at games. I will excel, us southpaws have always been able to overcome the dasterdly methods of the right hand majority.  Posted By  Daniel Ewald : 10:17 AM ET     Hi :-) Notwithstanding decades of study,scientists.still do not understand why human populations are biased toward right-hand use rather than left-hand use. Scientists disagree over what percentage of human populations are "right-handed"or "left-handed" because there is no standard definition for"handedness" Many left-handed writers have trouble with using writing tools. Maybe I think,left-handed people are more likely to be overweight... Why does the proportion of left-handers in the population not increase?? :D  Posted By  jung-hae kim, seoul south korea : 10:59 AM ET     I guess this explains why I am able to crank out about 125 wpm on my CELL PHONE... i dont even use a qwerty keyboard.. but T9 is my best friend. :)  Posted By  Seth : 2:27 PM ET     I am the only lefty in my family. I had a terrible time growing up trying to learn how to tie my shoe since  velcro wasn't invented! In school, I had to learn how to use right handed scissors since left handed anything wasn't invented until much much later! I am happy to say I learned by watching and doing everything backwards. To this day, I still have to use regular scissors because I can't cut anything with my left hand! I think it is easier today being a lefty than it was in the 60's and 70's.  Posted By  PJ : 6:50 PM ET     I am very proud to say that I am left-handed, and female (which is even less common). I am an avid sports player and outdoor adventurist, attending college to be a graphic designer (artist) and writer (journalist). I agree with the problem of right-handed desks, and the annoying pen smears as I write or draw. Recently, my friend told me about a website that sells supplies for left-handed people (ex: notebooks, pens/pencils, rulers, scissors). I think that as left-handedness becomes more "recognized" so to speak, companies will 'learn' to make changes in products to suit the needs of left-handed people. In the past left-handedness didn't really exist, everyone was made to use their right hand for common tasks; but things are changing. As for the increased risk for ailments...I will have to read more into that. Thanx for writing the article!  Posted By  Villette : 7:57 PM ET     As a child I only had problems being left-handed in school. Once I got older I found that about the only thing that I do with my left-hand is writing. Everything else I use my right hand for. I don't belief that being left-handed is passed down in your family history. I am the only person out of all of my family that is left-handed. And my husband is right-handed and I am left-handed so when I do have a child I will have to see if it is left or right-handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:00 PM ET     Suppose you do things with your left, then do other things with your right?  Some things I can do both left and right.  I shoot a rifle left handed, a bow, right handed, a hand gun right handed, shoot pool left handed, write with my right hand, can bat either left or right.  Am I mixed up?  Posted By  jp : 9:01 PM ET     Growing up, my right-handed mother told me she really couldn't begin to show me how to do things "the left-handed way."  She told me to just watch how she did things and then let me figure out what worked best for me.  As a result, I do some things much like a right-hander but with my left hand and some things I do mirror image.  I think it gave me a great way to work out problems from the very beginning that traditional right hand people might not have right off the bat.  Posted By  jebneill : 10:30 PM ET     My 2 daughters are both left handed and their mother and I are both right handed. hmmmmmm  Posted By  Anonymous : 12:30 AM ET     Being left-handed made my mother's life intollerable, as she went to school in what was then the Soviet Union. Indeed, they regarded it as an abnormality and forced her to write with her right hand. She writes with her right hand now and cannot use the left hand anymore. It gave her sleep disorders, headaches and nervous breakdowns. Luckily for me, they abolished the "switch" when I went to school... A proud lefty, I use the PC mouse, play bowling and knit with my right hand. The thing is that I was shown to use my right hand for all these activities and it didn't occur to me it could have been adapted for a lefty. I didn't have any problems with it though. Oh yes, I was told that left-handedness is more common in the Middle East. Can someone tell me whether it's true? E.  Posted By  Elena : 2:57 AM ET     I am left handed and in the IT industry. I have noticed that at both companies I have worked for Lefties represent between 30 and 70 percent of the technical staff. This is intresting because it is way over what would be considered normal distribution.  Posted By  c giesel : 7:18 AM ET     Like the other poster, I had the problem with the desks.  Every now and then, I found a left handed desk. I learned to use right handed scissors, but was thrilled when I found a left handed store that sold lefty scissors, can openers, etc.  The best thing I found was left handed nibs for calligraphy pens when I took calligraphy as a teenager.  Nowadays, it's easier for lefties because I think the internet allows us more access to left handed products, and more access to other resources for lefties.  We are not "sinister."  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:47 AM ET     How does this apply, if at all, to those of us who are ambidextrous? There are three of us that are ambidextrous in my family and two right handed.  Posted By  WB : 10:54 AM ET     I really enjoy being left handed. Even though I was faced with much bias,such as teachers trying to change me even as late as 4th grade, it has helped me in many areas. I am now able to use both hands in almost every area of life. I have had the ability to look at problems from many different ways also.  Posted By  Rick, Anchorage, Alaska : 5:48 PM ET     When I took the ACT, they had to find a left-handed desk for me, which delayed everyone by about 20 minutes.. I have very neat handwriting... My grandmother was left-handed, but back then, it was thought of as a hanicap so her teacher forced her to write with her right hand, which is why her handwriting is so sloppy now.. Both my grandfathers and my father are left-handed. My 6 year old cousin is ambidextrous.  Posted By  Tiana : 5:55 PM ET     I am a left-handed 70-yr old female.  My father was a "true" lefty who wrote with the backward slant.  But there was only one lefty (a niece) in the next two generations of our family. I believe I had more in common with the men of my generation, worked better with men, and make good business decisions. I do have some allergy and asthma problems, but stay very active.  Posted By  Phyllis : 10:21 PM ET     My Dad is left-handed, I'm left-handed, and my Mum's sister is left-handed (though they made her use her right hand, and that really messed her up). I think the one thing I've gotten from it, is the creativity to make use of what I have already.  In college, I used to sit in my desk sideways, to solve that problem.  Outside of that, it just took a little bit of time to figure out which side I wanted to do something on.  In gymnastics, I turned right when going backwards and left when going forwards.  I played ice hockey with my right-hand and softball with my left.  Now, with Jiu Jitsu, I just have to make up my own way to get into the positions, since I've pretty much become ambidexterous on everything, except for writing.  Posted By  Lara : 7:27 AM ET     How about a left-handed friendly digital camera.  The newer ones are just about impossible to operate for by a lefty.  Kodak are you listening?  Posted By  DotK : 9:50 AM ET     Sigh...all that pen ink smeared for all those years.  Although I'm a lefty when it comes to writing, I throw a baseball with my right hand.   I use a kitchen knife in my left hand, but when eating I cut my meat with my right hand.  And for the life of me, I can never remember if I'm goofy foot or regular when I occasionally surf or snowboard!  Perhaps it's all those years of living in a right handed world. Just have to ask...why does everyone exclaim "Oh, you're a lefty!" when they see you write in their presence in the same tone they would say "Wow, you have a third arm!"....?  Posted By  tanya w : 10:51 AM ET     There's a big difference between mortality rates for lefties in England and the US.  British lefties still die younger than righties, but only 2 years (on average) earlier compared with the US (7 years).  Almost all of this can be tied, statistically, to head on car crashes.  Lefties in the US will swerve into oncoming traffic, and the British to the shoulder/off the road.  Posted By  Anonymous : 11:10 AM ET     So, I have to ask. Was I the only one who used notebooks and binders from the back to the front so I wouldn't have wire or those binder clips digging into my arm? I actually had a teacher who would grade our notebooks...to make sure we were taking notes or some such blather. Well, she gave me a 70 because I did that. I didnt do it properly, appearantly, of course my objection was, where did you specify that I couldnt write from back to front? Especially when I actually wrote, TURN NOTEBOOK OVER in the front of the notebook. Gotta hate catholic school for some reasons!  Posted By  Joseph Stalin : 11:40 AM ET     I am left handed and still in school. school has been hard for me because i am also Dyslexic so all of my numbers would be backwards, and my handwriting was very sloppy. Teachers did not like this and would make me redo the assignment with all my numbers facing the right way. I still have problems with this and sometimes have to look at anothers paper to see which way to face my 5s or 3s. As far as tools for righties, I find being left handed an advantage. I golf righthanded but i always carry one lefty with me for hard shots you cant get to. Or pool were you can just switch hands rather that lean way over the table. The link between being ill and left handed, I am not sure if it true for all of you, but other than dyslexica, i have sever allergies, asthma, and i am very clumsy. I dont think its necessary for companies to mass produce left handed everthing. Even if they offered me left handed computers, desks, cameras, notebooks, siccors and such i would not use them. I am so used to knowing right handed things, and then they would have to add left handed things to all office buildings, schools, public places. that so unecessary.  Posted By  Kate : 12:39 PM ET     Throughout school, from the beginning when I wrote with my left hand completely backwards, to later when I had the telling smear on the side of my palm from retracing my writing, I have awkwardly fit into a righty world.  But now, I almost forget I am a lefty since most of my paperwork is done by the mostly neutral computer. I am interested in knowing that lefties may oversample for certain health conditions.  That had never occured to me.  It's also interesting to hear the recent research that lefties are more likely to be gay.  Hand preference is certainly an intriguing mystery!  Posted By  LCF : 2:05 PM ET     When I was learning to write, my school used those awful "erasable" pens, which smeared more than the ink on regular pens. To this day I write with my fingers facing me and my forearm perpendicular to my body, which both avoids contact with fresh ink and looks very uncomfortable to onlookers.  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:42 PM ET     I'm a lefty, but my entire family is right handed.  My great-grandfather discovered my "gift" when I was a baby as someone would put a spoon or other object in my right hand and every single time I would switch it to my left.  I don't write with a smear as a family friend taught me to write (her entire family of 5 are lefties) with my paper turned 45 degrees to the right.  It works wonderfully. I do all fine motor skills like painting, needlework, eating, and writing with my left hand, but all other things right handed like sports and scissors - I CANNOT use the lefty scissors at all!  Some things I alternate hands like house painting or cutting things in the kitchen with a knife.  I am extremely clumsy at times, but have really good balance.  Go figure! I have a 4 month old son and I think he's going to be a lefty because he sucks his thumb and has an extreme preference for his left hand!  Yay! By the way: Everyone's born right handed, lefties just overcame it!  Posted By  Krista : 1:15 AM ET     I am a woman who does all fine motor control things with my left hand, like writing, hand sewing, putting on make-up, etc. I also have a sister who is left handed but, just like me, does all other major motor things like batting,  kicking a ball or throwing one, right-handed. Both of our parents are right-handed. Both of us ARE very good athletes, even now in our fifties, including snow skiing and scuba diving regularly and daily swimming, and are in excellent health. After twenty-five years of doing social work in the projects and retiring from that, I am now  finishing my Master's in literature and about to begin my PhD studies in the same, and I read and type really fast. My sister is a labor and delivery nurse and very clever.  I would be curious to find out what the statistical methods and evidence this Dutch study consisted of, including how large a group was studied, and the information about their control group, and other methodology used, before putting too much credence into the statement that left-handed people are more likely to have health problems. It seems printing this  might unnecessarily alarm readers who don't have all of that data in front of them, to judge for themselves the reliability of the statistical data. I also happen to have observed in my literature classes that about 3 in 10 students are lefties, so that is interesting. It also seems, from their comments, that the left-handed persons seem more empathetic and sensitive in their comments about the books or to others, but that may just be my lefty bias: but they do seem more people-oriented. But it is curious that people who want to be teachers, as in many of the students in my classes, or people who were a social worker or a nurse like myself and my sister, seem to often be left-handed: all be involved in various types of  "helping" professions. It seems to me that lefties are perhaps also brighter verbally and not just more dextrous, as in with video games or sports. I used to play Ms. PacMan and Centipede like a fiend before I moved on to other things.  I would also like to see some study of their verbal and various types of abstract reasoning abilities as compared with right-handers. For example, who is better at verbal and who is better at math and why, if there is a difference? Of course, there are different lobes in both sides of the brain. I had always heard that lefties were more verbally proficient and righties more quantitatively clever, but I am not even sure if that is true. Some of the statistic data, numbers studied, etc., for some of those "older studies" mentioned in your article about health risks being higher for left-handed persons mentioned in your article, as well as the more recent ones and their specific data, might be helpful to your readers to see, as I have my doubts about that linkage. And, there's the fact that since I haven't seen those studies perhaps  perhaps I just don't want to believe them!  Posted By  Anonymous : 2:19 AM ET     Being a lefthanded in a religiously conservative country I had to change my habit of eating with left hand especially in the public-something i don't think was fair but had to do so.  Also many people notice when i write with my hand- i place the paper with the top side facing my right and I look at my writing in a 75 degree angle - this is because i cannot see my writing if i place the paper straight...may look weird but it works for me :)Irshad  Posted By  Irshad : 5:05 AM ET     are Animals ( with hands) also mostly right handed?  Posted By  Anonymous : 7:20 AM ET     Being a lefty has posed its challenges while growing up.  Ever notice how left-handed scissors often just have the handles adapted for lefties, but the blades are still set up for righties?  To this day, I prefer right-handed scissors, but can cut with my left. On the plus side - I have a pretty mean forehand with both my right and left arms while playing tennis. I can't say being a southpaw has hindered any activity I've learned - from knitting on up to sports.  I learned to do most things right-handed, or changed the technique on my own to accomodate my left-handedness. My father was originally a southpaw (but is of the end of the generation that saw being left-handed as being unacceptable) and I am a lefty.  So, I guess we're of the genetic strain of southpaws.  I wonder if my 3-year-old will develop a left-handed preference.... she's still fairly ambidextrous at the moment. I guess lefties just learn to be more adaptable... : )  Posted By  HH : 7:55 AM ET     maybe we have more of the health problems listed because we have to live in a Right Handed World!!!  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:52 AM ET     I had the same issues as a child ... the desk, the ink, etc...  I also like many other people do many things right handed -- possibly because no one was able to teach me how to do things with my left hand. As an adult and mother of two right handed boys, I now find myself running into a problem teaching them.  As much as I get involved in their everyday events, there are just some things my husband (also a right hander) has to help them with. The illness connection is new to me, I have never heard this before and will look into it more ... I've always been a proud lefty.  Posted By  Tanya Ryno : 12:01 PM ET     In kindergarten, I asked the teacher for a pair of scissors that would work for a left handed person.  The teacher replied "you might as well get used to it now, the world is right handed and will not make an exception for you."  I replied, "why not?"  To this day, I have not lost that same sense of spunk that characterized me in kindergarten.  The teacher underestimated me.  The world may not change for me but I have faired pretty well adapting to it.  But I would be curious to know the science that would explain why I was able to learn to use the scissors with my right hand and yet to this day I use a knife in my left hand. If I tried to use a knife in my right hand, I am afraid I might cut my own throat.  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:54 PM ET     Ah the joys of being the only lefthander in a family of seven but having one child each way (our rh daughter is the odd one out!) I have never felt discriminated against either at school or work, master and use technology ok, no particular health problems and can write backwards with ease (a most useful but under-appreciated talent). The only issues I have are with the moulded handles etc that are designed for the righthanded oddities amongst us.  Posted By  Pip, New Zealand : 10:20 PM ET     I am left handed and so far so good.  I learned to operate  scissor with right hand. I eat and write with my left hand.  During my highschool years, when I played lady soccer, I kicked the ball with my left foot. I think the Dutch study is bull!  Posted By  Ratna, New York, NY : 7:10 PM ET     What an interesting article on lefthandedness! I very seldom read comments by readers but was really into reading  comments by my fellow lefties. There is a huge variety among the lefthanded, due to education and culture and something you didn't get into in your article.....the seeming fact that no one is really strictly right- or lefthanded, but a combination showing preference for one or the other. While I am a lefty but do lots with my right hand, like use the mouse "over there", my daughter and her husband are much more left handed than  me. Eg,I can't use their mouses on the left when I visit them! Both their boys are righthanded, which must make for funny situations sometimes.Sometimes, in social gatherings, I ask people to clap, then freeze to see which hand is on top,(as well as scratching their backs without thinking what hand to use and other stuff) and they are usually surprised to see how many things they do with their left hand "leading" as it were. Pat, Valencia, Spain  Posted By  Patricia Greene : 3:45 AM ET     I am left handed.  My parents are both righties, and my dad is schizophrenic.  I was placed in a gifted/accelerated class in school, there were 15 of us and 12 of us were lefties.  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     My daughter and exhusband are both lefties.  Both have OCD, both are very very meticulous....My daughter has alot of emotional problems, reading this, I'm going to explore it more  Posted By  Anonymous : 5:57 PM ET     What does it mean when you're ambidextrous? I write left handed, bat left handed, and do some other tasks left handed.  But I throw, shoot basketball and some other things right handed.  Posted By  Anonymous : 6:02 PM ET     I am left-handed, female, and proud of both.  My worst grade in elementary school was penmanship--yes, I was allowed to write with my left hand.  Years later my teacher apologized to me for not taking into consideration that she taught the "right-handed" way. I love to knit; I wear my watch on my right wrist, and I wouldn't know how to use left-handed scissors (I always use scissors with my left hand). I can peel apples just with a knife--because those potato peelers are made for right-handers.  Thus, I am saving money by having to do it the hard way that becomes the easy way with practice. Furthermore, I believe there are a lot more lefties out there than 10%. How about adding the question about left- or right-handedness to the census?  Posted By  Anonymous : 9:27 PM ET     Well, I'm 52 and have never spent the night in the hospital.  I'm just about the only person I know my age that isn't on any prescription drugs.  I'm the only one in my family for 2 generations that is left handed.  As others have posted, I do a lot with my right hand too. I'm not a brain surgeon, but I'm not a moron either.  I have to agree with the poster who said maybe lefties die younger because of the stress of trying to deal with a right handed world. My husband is left handed also, but was forced into it because 3 days before starting the first grade, a car door was slammed on his right hand.  The teacher didn't want him to fall behind, so she made him switch.  How about some studies on people forced to switch to right handedness? Thanks.  Posted By  Lefty52 : 2:12 PM ET     There was an article re: mixed handedness and memory in the APA Monitor.  I am mixed handed.   Left eye and left foot dominances have probably contributed to this.  The jury is still out on hand dominance because there are certain things I can't do (at all) with my right hand, such as, opening jars, buttoning, most sports and fine motor tasks.  Any similar cases?  Posted By  DrummerSchultz : 9:15 AM ET     Your Questions:  Do you think that left-handedness has an influence on health? Why or why not? Do you think it's easier or harder to be a lefty in today's world? My answers: Totally not! Any left-handedness is a bit smarter than right-handedness, so they should have good attitude on their health, so the smarter left-handedness should live longer than right-handedness. Statistically speaking, left-handedness lives longer too.  Itâs not easier or harder for both lefty or rightly in todayâs world!  Posted By  Anonymous : 8:59 PM ET     I'm a lefty!!! I do things with both hands but I eat and write with my left. I play the guitar and the violin like a right hander that's just the way I learned. Probably the only problem I've ever had with being left handed was writing in spiraled notebook. I'd flip them over and write the backside. I don't have sloppy handwriting, but I do know a lefty who does. I do believe it could run in the family. My mom's a lefty. My grandmother's ambidextrous so is my aunt. I have about 8 cousins who are all lefties. I didn't realize how much of a lefty I was until I started skateboarding. When I tried it in a righty stance, I couldn't keep my balance. It just feels completely uncomfortable. It's nothing like batting on your right side.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .     Contents    1  Types  2  Causes   2.1  Division of labor  2.2  Genetic factors  2.3  Epigenetic factors  2.4  Prenatal hormone exposure  2.5  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry  2.6  Ultrasound    3  Handedness developmental timeline  4  Correlation with other factors   4.1  Intelligence   4.1.1  Early childhood intelligence    4.2  Health  4.3  Income  4.4  Left-handedness and sports  4.5  Gender  4.6  Sexuality and gender identity    5  In culture   5.1  Negative appeal  5.2  International Left-Handers Day    6  In other animals  7  See also  8  Sources  9  External links     Types [ edit ]   Right-handedness is most common. Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

(March 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In human biology , handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand ; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . [1] [2] [3]  Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women . [4] It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed .

Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that 70–95% of the world population is right-handed. [5]  Left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed. [6]  Cross-dominance or Mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence. [7]  Ambidexterity , equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned. [ citation needed ] A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand. [1]   Causes [ edit ]  There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth. [8] In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference. [9]  Division of labor [ edit ]  One common theory, as to how handedness affects the hemispheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. [10]  Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemisphere is either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less lateralized . [10]  Genetic factors [ edit ]  Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed. [11] A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the heritability of handedness is roughly 24%. [12]  To date, two theoretical single gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness, the first by Marian Annett [13] of the University of Leicester and the second by Chris McManus [11] of UCL .  However, the growing weight of evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic locus . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to determining this trait. [22]  Brandler et al. performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness. [23] These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. Nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).  Epigenetic factors [ edit ]  Twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%. [24] While the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear, Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric methylation of CpG sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries that have been related to handedness. [25] [26]  Prenatal hormone exposure [ edit ]  Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance". [27] [28] [29] [30]  Prenatal vestibular asymmetry [ edit ]  Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay, [31] and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness. [32]  Ultrasound [ edit ]  Another theory is that ultrasound may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between ultrasound screening (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness. [33]  Handedness developmental timeline [ edit ]  Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. 18-36 month old children showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping. [34] The decrease in handedness variability for 36-48 month old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference. [34]  Correlation with other factors [ edit ]  Intelligence [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and mathematical ability and List of musicians who play left-handed  In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand , Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain. [35]  Writing in Scientific American , McManus states that,   Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers’ brains are structured differently from right-handers’ in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population. [36]   Conversely, Joshua Goodman found that evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children. [37]  Early childhood intelligence [ edit ]  Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores. [38] The researchers used Bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.  Health [ edit ]  Lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handness. [39]  A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorders, depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , schizophrenia , and alcoholism has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness. [40] [41]  A 2012 study showed that nearly 40% of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed, [42] while another study demonstrated that Left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of Parkinson's Disease in women, but not in men. [43] Another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women, but the effect is unknown for men at this point. [44]  Left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater post-menopausal. [45]  At least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and in a cardiovascular context, are more likely to have reduced longevity. [46]  Left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures. [47]  One systematic review concluded: "Left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system". [48]  If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection. However, left-handers enjoy an advantage in fighting and sports increasing their likelihood of reproduction. [49]  Income [ edit ]  In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from Lafayette College and Johns Hopkins University concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts. [50]  More recently, in a 2014 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , Harvard economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.

Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In fencing , about half the participants are left-handed. [51]  Other, sports-specific factors may increase or decrease the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:   In cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e. , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e. , right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see Wasim Akram ). [ citation needed ]  In baseball , a right-handed pitcher's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers. [52] Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. [53] Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. [54] Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls. [55]  Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base. [55]  Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder . [56] For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. [57] A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a baserunner trying to score. [57] With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. [57] On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states: [57]    One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls. A right-handed catcher catches a right-hander's breaking ball across his body, with his glove moving out of the strike zone. A left-handed catcher would be able to catch the pitch moving into the strike zone and create a better target for the umpire.    In four wall handball , typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.  In water polo the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.  Ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness. [58]  In American football , the handedness of a quarterback affects blocking patterns on the offensive line . Tight ends , when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the offensive tackle on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.   Gender [ edit ]  According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.222 male to female odds ratio. [4] [ clarification needed ]  Sexuality and gender identity [ edit ]  Further information: Handedness and sexual orientation  A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness, [59] though findings are mixed. [60] [61] [62]  A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have non-traditional gender identities were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical control group (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). [63]  Paraphilias (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness". [64] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia . [65] [66] [67] [68]  A 2014 study attempting to analyze the biological markers of asexuality asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be left-handed than their heterosexual counterparts. [69]  In culture [ edit ]  Main article: Bias against left-handed people  Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers." [70]  McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the Industrial Revolution , workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a dip pen . While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains. [71]  Negative appeal [ edit ]  Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective sinister means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).  There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In French , gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) ( cognate to English direct and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.  Black magic is sometimes referred to as the " left-hand path ".  Until very recently in Taiwan (and still in Mainland China , Japan and both North and South Korea ), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of stroke order , developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer. [72] Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the Latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general. [ citation needed ] Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward. [73] [74]  International Left-Handers Day [ edit ]  Main article: International Left-Handers Day  International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13. [75] It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990. [75] International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed." [75] It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!" [75]  In other animals [ edit ]  Kangaroos and other macropod  marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. ‘True’ handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike placental mammals , they lack a corpus callosum . Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo ( Macropus rufus ) and the eastern gray kangaroo ( Macropus giganteus ). Red-necked (Bennett’s) wallabies ( Macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. [76] Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are lefties.

Election Odds: The 2012 U.S. Presidential Election  Episode 1: Introducing The “What Are The Odds?” Podcast                      What Are The Odds Of Being Left-Handed?     Health             The odds of being left-handed are about 10%. Men’s odds of being left-handed are approximately 1.23 times greater than women’s, according to a meta-analysis of 144 studies.   The small size of the left-handed population has been so stable through millennia that even the archaeological record bears out the rough proportion of left-handed individuals; ancient cave paintings and archaic weapons indicate that left-handed people have existed as a small minority as far back as the early days of human history. However, despite our general familiarity with how few people are left-handed, left-handedness continues to mystify us. Historically, left-handers have frequently been maligned, and today, although attitudes towards left-handedness have generally softened, what it means to be left-handed is often misunderstood and some aspects of left-handedness remain a mystery altogether.   Because the trait was generally looked down upon in Western society, people attempted to force left-handed children to use their right hands until relatively recently. Left-handed people were sometimes considered either defective, evil or both. Stories abound of parents punishing their children for using their left hands or even tying up the left hand to prevent its use. For some, views of left-handedness veered beyond superstition into the realm of pseudoscience. For instance, Cesare Lombroso, a late 19th century Italian physician and criminologist, viewed left-handedness as evidence of a biological regression to primitiveness and furthermore, he regarded this physical characteristic as a basis for distinguishing criminals from noncriminals.  Today: Left-Handedness the Upper Hand?  On the one hand, so to speak, views of left-handedness have improved dramatically over the years. On the other hand, there is still a so much that we just don’t understand about left-handedness. Ironically, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction when it comes to popular views on handedness and intelligence. Many people believe that left-handers are generally more intelligent than the rest of the population, yet when it comes to IQ, studies have shown that left-handers have only a one point edge over right-handed people. Moreover, from a genetic perspective, an Oxford University study found that the gene associated with left-handedness, LRRTM1, is also associated with dyslexia and increased risk for developing schizophrenia.  Nonetheless, left-handers’ brains do appear to process information differently, processing information across the hemispheres more readily than do right-handers’, a tendency that is thought to be linked to increased creativity and a stronger grasp of spacial relationships. Additionally, a greater number of left-handed individuals than right-handeders demonstrate exceptional ability in mathematics as well as music, as is attested in a study that found a larger proportion of gifted left-handed musicians in professional orchestras as well as studies that revealed a high number of left-handers among students taking tests assessing mathematical giftedness. Left-handedness may also be advantageous in  both one-one-one competitive sports (such as boxing and tennis) and one-on-one combat;  while left-handers have a great deal of experience with right-handed opponents, right-handers do not have very much experience with left-handers.

Uncategorized          Back to Uncategorized           English   Español       I'm just curious about the genetics of handedness.  Both of my parents are left-handed, both myself and my brother are right-handed.  My husband and I are both right-handed and we have 2 children, one's a lefty and one's a righty.  My husband's parents are both righties.  It's just something I've always wondered about since we studied genetics in 6th grade and the teacher told us that handedness was Mendelian like eye color, but couldn't explain why I'm a righty (no doubt wondering if maybe I was adopted, which I wasn't, lol!)       -A curious adult from Florida Your teacher was close in that handedness is like eye color.  Except that what makes them similar is that neither is a simple Mendelian trait.  A simple Mendelian trait is one where there is a dominant and a recessive gene.  Remember, we have 2 copies of most of our genes—one from mom and one from dad.  If some version of a gene is dominant, then you only need one copy of that version to see a trait.  For example, let's say that the right hand gene was dominant over the left hand gene.  You'd be right-handed with either one or two copies of the right hand gene.  To be left-handed, both copies would have to be the left hand gene.  So if two lefties had a baby, the baby should turn out left-handed.  This is not the case for your family or lots of others either.  When people have looked at handedness, it just doesn't follow simple rules.  For example, if both parents are right-handed, there is a 1 in 10 chance of having a left-handed child.  The same is true if the dad is left-handed.  If the mother is left-handed, the odds rise to 2 in 10. And if both parents are left-handed, the child has a 4 in 10 chance of being left-handed.  If a classic dominant-recessive model were in play, then left-handed people would only have left handed kids.  But they don't even have left-handed kids most of the time!  What's going on here is that genes aren't the whole story.  The best evidence that something besides genes are involved comes from looking at identical twins.  Remember, identical twins start out with exactly the same DNA.  If something is completely determined by genetics, then if one identical twin has it, the other in the pair should as well. When one twin is left handed, the other twin is left handed only 76% of the time.  Clearly genes aren't enough.  So, what else is involved?  Most likely, the environment plays a role.  There are probably one or more genes that make you more likely to become left-handed.  You then need some sort of environmental trigger for it to happen.  This is what happens with, for example, juvenile diabetes.  Scientists believe that not everyone who has the genes necessary for diabetes get it.  A current theory is that you need certain genes and a viral infection to get the body to attack its own pancreas and give itself diabetes.  But is there any evidence for a trigger with handedness?  I couldn't find much research in people, but some interesting studies have been done with chimpanzees.  In chimpanzees, being right handed is about twice as common as being left handed (as opposed to around 9 times as likely in humans).  When scientists studied chimpanzees, they found that the chances for having a left-handed baby increased significantly based on birth order.  The first and sixth or later babies had a much higher chance of being left-handed than did the middle ones.  What do the first and later pregnancies have in common?  They tend to have hormonal variations that don't happen with the middle pregnancies.  And this might be the environmental trigger we're looking for.  There is some evidence in humans that birth order may play a role as well.  Nothing as clear-cut as we see with chimps but we do know that older mothers tend to have more left handed children.  Also, at least with boys, some studies have shown that later kids are more likely to be left-handed.  So, handedness is most likely due to a combination of genes and environment.  Some people have a greater chance of being left-handed but something needs to trigger it.  Remember, the identical twin story argued against genes being the whole story.  It also argues that birth order isn't everything either. If it were, then if one identical twin was a lefty, the other would always be one as well.  Birth order might be one trigger but there must be others as well.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.  Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”  Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.  They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.  Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.  The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.  “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”  If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.  The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.  Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.  Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.  On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.  “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.  Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.  “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.  “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”  The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research.

August 25, 2016 / 21 Comments / in Being Left Handed  / by Neal What percentage of people are left handed? Ever signed for a delivery and had the driver ask if you’re a lefty? Apparently we’re still that much of a rarity that people feel the need to point it out to us every time they notice. I’m not having a go, I do it myself. All the time… Last week at work the purchasing team ordered a bunch of Fender merchandise, including ( for some reason! ) this ridiculous anime lunchbox . Rather than asking why in the hell we were stocking a Fender lunchbox (like everyone else in the office), I proudly pointed out that the girl on the front was playing a left handed guitar. So apparently it’s still a novelty even to me . A guy who is left handed, plays guitar lefty, and runs a lefty guitar website … What makes for the fascination? Just how many people are left handed exactly ? Check out the handy, dandy infographic below (click to enlarge!), or keep reading to find out. What Percentage of People are Left Handed? Roughly 12% of the world is left handed. This figure is averaged from studies undertaken in North America and Western Europe. In these developed countries being left handed is less likely to be discouraged due to social stigmas, which should result in a less skewed overall number. Although it should be noted that left handed discrimination does still occur in these countries, such as this well publicised example in the USA in 2015. Right Handed (~87%) . I’m sure you didn’t come to this article unaware that right handed people make up the majority of the population. It is estimated that right handed people amount to roughly 87% of the world. Left Handed (~12%) . The second most common handedness type, studies show that on average us lefties make up around 12% of the population. Although this does vary depending on location, as in some countries being left handed may still have a social stigma attached to it. For example Taiwan (5%), Japan (4.7%), and Korea (2%) all have a much lower population of lefties. Scroll down a little further to see the lefty representation broken down by country. Ambidextrous (<1%) . An ambidextrous person is able to perform any task equally well with either hand, although they do still tend to favor their dominant side. Truly ambidextrous people are incredibly rare, and are estimated to make up less than 1% of the population. Ambivelous (<1%) . An ambivelous (or ambisinister) person is the exact opposite of an ambidextrous person, finding it generally awkward to use either hand to undertake tasks. Age is a Factor Even until recently, being left handed was still discouraged in many developed countries. We can see this when we look at the number of lefties in different age groups in North America. Only 6% of over-65s identified as being left handed, whereas a whopping 15% of under 30s said the same. Check out the graph below which shows the percentage of lefties broken down by year. These results were taken from a large study by Gilbert and Wysocki ( Hand Preference and Age in the United States , 1992) which included over 1 million people. The increased number of people identifying as being left handed is almost certainly due to modern society becoming less conservative. On top of this, it is estimated that amongst older generations some 6-8% of right handed people are actually natural left handers , but were forced into writing right handed due to social pressures. Considering the results based on age, it would seem very likely that the overall percentage of people identifying as being a lefty will continue to increase over time. How Many People Are Left Handed In Other Parts of the World? The figures above are taken from a select few countries, but what about the rest of the world? Check out the graphic below to find out! Data for European countries was taken from a large internet study by McManus and Peters ( Handedness in Europe: analysis of data from the BBC internet study ). Information on other countries was sourced from various other bodies of research. It’s clear that in countries with a more formal culture, the rate of left-handedness is much lower. It has been suggested that the more complex writing style in many Asian countries is a major reason why the numbers are so much lower. Men Versus Women Lefties are not created equally! According to a 2008 study ( Sex Differences in Left-Handedness: A Meta-Analysis of 144 Studies ), a left handed person is 23% more likely to be male than female . This means that for every 4 left handed women, there should be roughly 5 left handed men. One possible explanation for this uneven split is that girls are more likely to conform to social norms. It has also been suggested that there may be genetic factors, which you can read about below. The Chances of Having a Left Handed Child According to a 2009 study by Llaurens, Raymond and Faurie ( Why are some people left-handed? An evolutionary perspective ), the chances of having a left handed child are as follows: Both parents Left Handed – 27% Male / 21.4% Female Righty Father & Lefty Mother – 22.1% Male / 21.7% Female Lefty Father & Righty Mother – 18.2% Male / 15.3% Female Both Parents Right Handed – 10.4% Male / 8.5% Female I’ve averaged these results out for simplicity and displayed them in the graphic below. Another interesting factoid I stumbled across was that two left handed parents are twice as likely to produce twins! Is There A Place Where 100% of People Are Lefties? Yes!
