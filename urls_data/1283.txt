You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Doctors said the chance was 500,000 to one - but how accurate is this estimate? Twinning rates vary around the world, but in the UK there is a 112-to-one chance of a pregnancy resulting in non-identical twins. That's if we don't include babies conceived through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), where twin births occur much more frequently. So in theory the odds of having two sets would be 112 multiplied by 112, which is around 12,500 to one and the odds of having three sets would be 112 cubed, or 1.4 million to one. But it's not quite that simple, because non-identical twins come in clusters.      More or Less: Behind the stats  Listen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free podcast  Download the More or Less podcast  More stories from More or Less  Rolling a six on a dice doesn't suggest that another six is on the way, but having non-identical twins makes more twins much more likely next time. "Family studies have shown that a woman who has had DZ (non-identical) twins is more about four times more likely to have more" in a subsequent pregnancy, than a woman who has not, says Jane Denton, Director of the Multiple Births Foundation. So for a woman who has had one set of non-identical twins, the chance of another set is not 112 to one, but just 28 to one.      Image caption  Rowan and Isla Rodger - the third of three sets of twins   Therefore, the probability of having three sets of non-identical twins is not one in 500,000, but one in 112 x 28 x 28... which is about 88,000. Identical twins are much less common. In the UK, they turn up once in 227 pregnancies on average - again, excluding IVF conceptions - and they do not come in clusters.  Twinning rates around the world       6.2 per 1,000 births in Vietnam (1 in 161)  15.8 per 1,000 births in the UK (1 in 63)  27.9 per 1,000 births in Benin (1 in 36)  33.2 per 1,000 births in the USA (1 in 30)  Source: Plos One    NHS Choices: Pregnant with twins or more  So the chance of three sets of identical twins is 11.7 million to one against. These figures for the UK, however, do not apply to the rest of the world. Twinning rates vary enormously from one country to the next. In Vietnam, on average, there are 6.2 twins per 1,000 births, while in the US there are five times as many - 33.2 per 1,000 births. It's not known why this is but it appears that body composition can influence the chance of having twins. Several studies have shown that for tall women (164cm and over), the relative chance of having twins is between 1.5 and two times higher than for short women (under 155cm). Mothers of twins also have a higher body mass index (BMI) compared to mothers of single children - a BMI of less than 20 is associated with a lower probability of twinning while a BMI of 30 or more is associated with a higher likelihood.  Previously in More or Less      Since the Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to hospital with acute morning sickness - hyperemesis gravidarum - there has been a great deal of speculation about the possibility of her having twins. But what are the chances?  Royal baby: What are the odds of twins? (December 2012)  There is also evidence that the chance of having twins increases the later a mother gives birth. Experts think this happens because of a change in hormonal signals sent between pituitary gland and the ovary. In the UK, the odds of having any kind of twins at any age is one in 63 but these odds reduce to one in 46 once a woman is older than 35, and one in 18 if a woman conceives after the age of 45. A number of studies have shown that in several countries seasonal variation influences non-identical twinning. There are higher rates of conception during the summer and autumn. One theory put forward is that day length may influence hormonal concentrations driving ovarian activity and influence fertility and multiple ovulation. A study by Johan Fellman and Aldur Eriksson at the Folkhalsan Institute of Genetics in Helsinki also suggests that changes in food supply during different seasons may also contribute.

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

Share          Expert Answer       The BabyCentre editorial team  Our panel of health writers     Non-identical (fraternal) twins tend to run in families. But identical twins don't.  Non-identical twins are the result of two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. There is a gene that makes a woman more likely to release two or more eggs during ovulation, and it's this gene that runs in families. Identical twins are the result of a single fertilised egg splitting, and this seems to be a random event.  So if you're a woman and non-identical twins run in your family, you're more likely to have a set yourself. It's estimated that you're about two and a half times more likely than average to have twins if you're a non-identical twin, or have siblings who are non-identical twins.  A man with a family history of twins may carry the gene, but it won't mean he can father a set of non-identical twins. The gene is only expressed through women who ovulate. If he has daughters, they may inherit the gene, and one day go on to have fraternal twins.  This may explain why some people think that twins skip a generation in families. You may have heard, for example, that if your mum or dad is a twin but you're not, you're more likely to have twins yourself. There's no evidence to support this. What can happen, though, is that a dad can pass on the non-identical twin gene to his daughters and this may make twins appear to skip a generation.  Your heritage can affect your chances of having twins. For example, non-identical twins are most common in women of Central African origin, and least common in women of South-East Asian and Latin American origin.  Aside from inheritance, age plays a big role in how likely you are to have twins. If you're a woman in your mid-30s or beyond, you have a greater chance than a younger woman of having twins or more. As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which could trigger your ovaries to release several eggs each month.  The use of some fertility treatments also increases the likelihood of a woman having twins. All treatments that stimulate the ovaries to release eggs or involve two or more embryos being transferred to the womb increase the chance of multiple births.

Of course, those odds are lower since identicals are a fluke with no genetic predisposition involved.

Reply  Close F  Faininator @Ms450f  She said boy/girl so fraternal. Fraternal aren't genetic like identical twins, although the gene for hyper ovulation is passed down genetically so, it's very likely if you've hyper ovulated once or carry the gene, you will do so again. This is why I had my tubes tied after our twins bc we have 3 under 1 and an 11 year old and my doctor told me if I got pregnant again the chances would be much higher that I'd hyper ovulate again and have another set of twins. It's much more uncommon to see people with two sets of identicals. Reply  Close D  DoubleUnicornPoo @Faininator  Fraternal are the type that CAN have a genetic component. Identical are pure chance (at least based on current science). Your chances of having a second set of fraternal twins is about 8%, up from the 1-3% chance the general population has of having twins.

Reply  Close D  DoubleUnicornPoo @kseds  I'll add to what kseds said with the numbers I remember seeing. The chances of a 2nd set of fraternals is 1 in 12 which sounds really high but works out to about 8% (up from the 1-3% that the general populace has of having twins). The chances of having 2 sets of identicals is 1 in 70,000. That's 0.000014%. Reply  Close B  Bb386 I have 2 singletons but lost di-di twins between them at 15 and 23 weeks respectively (the former due to selective reduction after a severe chromosomal abnormality diagnosis, and the latter due to preterm labour from an infection I developed from one of the many invasive procedures I had during that pregnancy). I'm currently expecting another set of di-di twins mid-August (thankfully going much better this time). All 4 pregnancies happened in 4.5 years between the ages of 25-30 with no family history of twinning and no predisposing factors other than my height. I've heard chances of di-di twins after the first set is 1 in 12, but I tend to think some women hyperovulate more often than that and the data doesn't reflect it because most women stop having children after a few singles and/or multiples.

Even with fraternals you still have a good chance because of hyper ovulation (which is genetically passed down) They don't know a whole lot about twins honestly (which makes them so amazing and special) my doctor told me to be careful if I didn't plan on a tubal after I deliver this time bc my chances of conceiving twins again would be high and more likely to hyper ovulate again. I'll have 3 babies under 1 here any day so we don't want that to happen right now lol Reply  Close D  DoubleUnicornPoo @Faininator  There's actually no known genetic component to identical twins. Having identical twins does not increase your chance of having twins again. Fraternal twins are the ones with the genetic component to hyperovulate (although not everyone who hyperovulates has a genetic predisposition to).

Reply  Close m  mainemommatobe @francesnell  Those look like Di/Di twins - meaning that you hyperovulated and had two eggs fertilized by two sperm. They have their own placentas and their own sacs/homes. In this case, they are most likely to be fraternal. There is a small chance however that they could be identical if the egg split super early on (day 1-3).

By Stephanie / 5						COMMENTS  111 Shares    Most moms consider themselves lucky enough to have one set of twins, but if you’re incredibly lucky, then you might even end up with two pairs of twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice?    What are the chances of having twins? The birth rate for twins is only going up, rising by as much as 76% in the last 30 years. That means that your chance of having twins in the USA is as high as 3 in 100 births. But that’s fraternal twins. The chance of identical twins is the same as it’s always been, which is around 3 in 1000 babies born as identical twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice? Obviously, the chance of having two sets of twins is pretty rare, but it’s not as rare as you might think. If you’re looking for two sets of twins of any type, the chance of that is around 1 in 3,000, which is the same chance as getting struck by lightning during your life!   A set of identical twins and fraternal twins is only around 1 in 10,000, or the same odds that you’re going to fall off your toilet and end up in hospital! Having two sets of identical twins is pretty damn unlikely, with only 1 chance in 70,000. Bear in mind that if you’ve already got one set of twins, you might actually be more likely to have a second set, because of all of the things that increase your chances of twin births. Things like: Having already been pregnant before. Women who have already had a baby, including women who have already had twins, are more likely to have twins in the future! Getting older. Women over the age of around 35 have more twins in general, because in the few years before you hit peri-menopause, your ovaries start to release more than one egg at a time. Having some sort of fertility treatment, like IVF or fertility drugs. These sort of things can stimulate your body to produce multiple eggs over and over. Coming from a family with twins in it. There’s some sort of genetic component to twins, and if twins run in your family, then you’re more likely to have them. This also means that if you’ve had twins once, they might run in your family and you might have them again! Being on the pill, or just coming off of the pill. Apparently, the hormonal changes that the pill causes in women can increase their chances of having twins. Being taller or heavier than average. Taller and heavier women have a greater than normal chance of having twins . But remember to stay healthy! Make sure your partner has a lot of zinc in his diet. Zinc contributes to healthy sperm, and the healthier your partner’s sperm, the more you have of chance of conceiving twins! Twins are getting more and more common, so if you have one set of twins and you’re going for another, you might just get lucky! How do you think you would cope with two sets of twins? Do you know anyone who actually has two sets of twins? Or maybe you’re one of the incredibly fortunate women who beat the odds and has an awesome foursome! Let us know in the comments below!        Nicole  says: October 25, 2017 at 10:20 pm I actually know 2 people within 30 mins of each other who have 2 pairs of twins! Reply   Deidre Turner  says: November 17, 2017 at 5:01 am Me! I’m 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins (both di/di). My first set were conceived with the assistance of fertility treatment (IUI), then I had a singleton conceived naturally and I’m pregnant with twins again, conceived naturally this time. I’m not particularly tall or big, I’m under 35 (currently 34 and was 29 having my first set), I haven’t been on the pill for years and hubby’s sperm counts are ok but not great. I’ve only been pregnant 3 times. I was on only 25mg (half a tablet) of clomid for 4 cycles over 5 years ago so that’s all the fertility drugs I ever took. It explains the first set but not the second set. I think that family history is my biggest influence; my nanna had 2 sets of twins and a set of triplets; my mum is one of the triplets. I’m the only one in my large extended family who has had any multiples at all so it looks like the twin gene skipped straight to me!

So, the basic answer is "yes" you have a slightly higher chance of conceiving twins again if you conceived fraternal twins naturally....other factors up the chances.  We've had plenty of moms here go on to have just singletons after twins, and we've had a few have twins again.  A good breakdown though is to look at Michelle Duggar.Â  She has 19 children, and had 1 miscarriage.Â  Out of those 20 conceptions, 2 times were fraternal twins so she's been pregnant 17 times...so in 1 inÂ 8.5 pregnancies for her, she had twins.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Momoftwins628 · Original Poster    Last edited 07/23/2011      Well im overweight and also african american (we have a higher rate of twins) and also twins run in my family....so how do you know if you "hyperovulate" ?

I can always tell when I've ovulated, because I've always been able to feel it.Â  There are some months I feel it on both sides, and some only on one side, but even then, one ovary can release multiple eggs.  Sooooo, unless you're hooked up to an ultrasound machine during your ovulation time every month there's no way to "know" 100% if you've hyperovulated or not.  It's a craps shoot unfortunately.Â You should be able to ask for an ultrasound based on your history ofÂ having twins though.Â  Good luck!Â    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB             Reply            Report this comment       0                     MOMWM    Last edited 07/23/2011      I have 5 and a half year old frat's and 1 yo frats.Â  Would love to try and have number 5 but my dh  (dear husband) is worried about number 5 being 5 and 6.Â  Second time around is much easier.

The statistics are somewhat irrelevant, because I believe they are very inaccurate. We never thought we'd have a second set of twins b/c our first was identical, and that is supposedly a random occurance. Surprise, surprise! A second set of identical twins.The statistical odds of that are 1 in 70,000 - based on 1 in 250 births is monozygotic twins - but I hypothesize it is probably more likely than 1 in 250 to have a second set of identical twins. After hearing about families with 2,3 and even 4 sets of MZ twins as the ONLY children, I think some moms just always have MZ twins. I think I may be one of them...so far hubby is not willing to find out though! There is some research being done on this somewhere.  As for fraternals, yes, there more likely to have a second set too, statistically I have heard 1/10,000 to have 2 sets, but I have heard once you have 1 set, it is 1/5 you would have another.  Most moms of twins don't have genetic testing done and I think they are conditioned to believe their twins are fraternal because moms are so keen to the slight differences in appearance and the obvious differences in personality. I think alot of moms out there actually have identical twins but think they are fraternal.  Â    --  Mom to 2 sets of identical twin girls plus a 'spare' (baby girl #5 that is!)

Do you know for sure that they were ID twins??  The reason I ask is based on the research that I have done the only 100% way to know is through dna testing.  And I believe that if frat twins implant very close together they can have the appearance of looking identical.  The placentas can fuse together also giving the appearance of two babies sharing one placenta.  If by some chance your twins were actually fraternal and not identical then you definately have increased odds of concieving twins again.  But ID's are a fluke of nature with no statistical evidence to suggest that once you have one set you are more likely to have another.  Again I am very sorry for your loss.  And good luck for a wonderful healthy pregnancy this time! :)    --  Jennifer, mom to 4 great kids and twins, Sam and Livy born January 14, 2009 at 37 weeks!

It does happen, but I have never met anyone with 2 set of id twins.  There a few ways of knowing for sure if your twins are id or fraternal while pregnant:  b/g- fraternal  or  the babies share an amionic sac and placenta.  or  DNA test  THe implantation of the twins will not necessary tell you anything. Identical who split early can have placentas on opposites sides of the uterus (there is a lady on the "got twins" board who was told no doubt that her boys were fraternal b/c of the placenta placement,  dna test confirmed her boys were id) Also, fraternal can have fussed placenta if the placenta form too close. So, if you had same sex twins, you would not know for sure. There have been b/g twins who have had fussed placentas.    --  ~~Emily ~~ Momma to wild and crazy identical twins!- Calum and Liam- 1/24/08 and sweet baby girl Audrey 7/25/11             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Colorado09 · Original Poster    Posted 04/06/2009      They were monoamniotic (in one sac)...thats why the doc thought they stopped growing/hearts stopped beating.

There is no medically possible way to have b/g identical twins...identical is identical...you can't have matching dna is you aren't the same sex.  It is common sense.  I know this because I have done research..and I have girl identical twins.  I had a very rough pregnancy...I had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome...and I lost one of my little girls at 27 weeks..and delivered my other daughter at 27 weeks.  I just want to let others know that if you are prego with identical twins...please becareful and go to a high risk pregnancy doctor.  And get your babies checked often.  Good luck!

I think that you meant to say identical not fraternal. Fraternal can not be monoamniotic- only identical. Fraternal are from 2 separate eggs. Identical are 1 egg that splits.  Also, very unluckly that you have b/g identical twins. It can happen, but is very rare. There are a few documented cases. Google it. If it happens, the girl will not make it b/ of chromosomal abnormalities. So, more likely than not,  if you have b/g twins, they are fraternal. They may look a lot alike.

But, when reading the below, keep in mind that Michelle Duggar who has 18 children, only has 2 sets of twins!  Here's some good information:  Factors that Influence Twins Twins can occur naturally in any woman at any time. However, there are certain factors that increase your chances of having twins. These factors include:     Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably.    Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins.    Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. Women produce more ovulation-stimulating hormone as they age, increasing your chance of releasing more than one egg during ovulation. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39.    Previous Twins: If you’ve already had twins, it is more likely that you will have another twin pregnancy.    Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.    Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, women can increase their chances of having twins up to 20%.    Weight Gain : A study by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology linked the recent rise in multiple births with the steady rise of obesity in North America. Women with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 are more likely to have twins than those in the suggested BMI range of 19 to 25.     --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     j_l_badders    Posted 02/06/2009      I heard its more likely with fraternal than identicalsince fraternal is about releasing more than one egg and identical is a by chance thing with the egg splitting but I read somewhere (have no clue where now) while I was pregnant that its more than a 50% after fraternal but that doesn't seem likely???I do however know a 2x twin mom so yeah it happens. There was a post about this on the multiples board a few weeks ago. I didn't get back to check and see what the out come was though.

But again, the chances are not 50% like some people think...again, Michelle Duggar has only had 2 sets of twins among her 18 children, and they were pretty far apart with several singletons in between.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     tazzersize2000 · Original Poster    Posted 02/06/2009      wow!  a co-worker at my old job had one kid then had a set of twins!!???mommytotwingirls do you plan on having any other children?

I heard from someone you can do a test to see if you ovulate two eggs every time.  If that is that case you can always do IVF  (in vitro fertilization) and put in one egg.  A friend of a friend wants to do this because her twins were born very early because of a problem she has and does not want to risk having another set of twins and losing them both.    --  JAM DS 1/2005 , DD 12/2006 Twins!

Because your twins are naturally occuring (I have ID girls as well) the odds of you having another set are fairly high, but they taper off as time goes. The window they recommend is after 3 years, then the odds drop to almost nothing. I cannot remember the exact percentages but they were enough to keep me from forgetting to take my Seasonale daily. My MOMs group as one lady who had a single, twins, twins then triplets and another who had DD, twin Ds, and then triplet Ds in the hopes of having a boy. Even had the sperm spun. Now, most of those births are under 2 years apart. The nomotc.org has some stats on this I'm sure. I waited and now I think I'm done because we kicked diapers and now that I know how wonderful it can be, I don't think I can ever go back to the diaper phase! Hope this helps!!!

I am not sure at what age, 30 something. I was 38 when I got pregnant for the first time with twins. I lost those babies and got pregnant again soon afterwards and I now have triplets.  I have also read that if your twins are identical your chance of another set is not that high the next.

I have 3 year old identical G/G twins (as confirmed by DNA cheek swab), so I thought that there's no chance I'd ever have twins again -especially since there are NO twins in my family and I just turned 30.  WRONG!!!!  Here I am, having my second set of twins! We do not yet know if the yare ID or Frat...but will certainly find out.  I came across the same statistic as c winmommy, that having 2 sets of ID twins is a 1 in 70,000 shot.  However, one set ID and one set FRAT are only 1 in 10,000.  Either way, a long shot, but here I am - living proof that it does happen!  So, in my local twins club seom of the moms have told me they just read something - somewhere -about how some women have a propensity to have identical twins...something about an enzyme or protein or something.  I'd love to hear from anyone that knows about this!  Or anyone working on their second set of twins for that matter!

Undo Answer Wiki 4 Answers   Nikhil Dandekar , Datacurious Answered Nov 17, 2015 · Author has 193 answers and 779.6k answer views If you have had fraternal twins already, your chance of having another set is 1 in 3000 . This is because most women who conceive fraternals show a pattern of releasing more than one egg per cycle. The odds of having one set of identicals and one set of fraternals is 1 in 10,000. If a woman has one set of identicals, her chance of having another is 1 in 70,000 or less. The odds of having 3 sets of twins, of any kind, is 1 in 500,000.

Ask New Question   Pat Harkin , Got a genetic degree years ago so most of what they taught me is now wrong. Updated Nov 18, 2015 · Author has 8.2k answers and 5.9m answer views There is an increased  chance that a woman will have non-identical (fraternal or dizygotic ) twins if her female ancestors did. There is no similar increase in the case of identical (monozygotic) twins. Do twins run in families? To have fraternal twins, a woman must release more than one egg at a time and the tendency to do this seems to have an inherited component. Identical twin arise when a fertilise egg/early embryo splits in two. I don't know why this happens and I can't find a decent explanation (though it's not my field so I could be looking in the wrong places.) [EDIT] The question and details have been edited, so here's some more info. "What is the chance of a woman having a set of twins?" is a REALLY tricky question to answer. It's very easy to answer the question "What is the chance of a woman's next pregnancy producing a set of twins?" (about 1 in 90 pre-IVF days, about 1 in 40 now) but unless you know the answer to the question "What is the chance of a woman becoming pregnant?" you can't multiply through. Things get even more complicated when you ask "What's the chance of a second set of twins?" A lot of people with twins say "That's enough!" The chance of a woman's first two pregnancies (implicit in this is the assumption that there will be two) naturally resulting in twins is about 1 in 90 (first pregnancy) time "a bit more than" 1 in 90 (second pregnancy) or around 1 in 8000.  The chance of the first two pregnancies of any woman being twins is therefore around 1 in 8000, but the chance of a set of twins resulting from the next pregnancy in a woman who already has one set is better than 1 in 90. The differences arise because of the  difference between the events which have already occurred, i.e. don't need to have their probability estimated (it's 1.0) Consider the questions "What is the chance of  tossing a fair coin twice and getting heads? (One in four) against "I  tossed a coin and got heads. What is the chance the second toss will  also give heads? " (One in two) 1k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

But the surprise was more than most for Stacey Wright who gave birth to two sets of twins within 14 months. The 29-year old was stunned when she discovered she was pregnant with her second set of twins - despite being on the contraceptive pill. Miss Wright, who lives in Maidstone, Kent, with her partner Peter Podolski, 28, a doorman, first had sons Harry and Oscar in April 2010.       Stacey Wright and her partner Peter Podolski were stunned when they discovered she discovered she was pregnant with her second set of twins - despite being on the contraceptive pill. Sons Harry and Oscar (left to right) arrived in in April 2010 and she had daughters Annie and Eliza (left to right) prematurely in June 2011  But the following January she was astonished to hear she was pregnant again - with more twins. And she went on to deliver daughters Annie and Eliza prematurely in June 2011. The odds of having two sets of twins are 1 in 700,000 - but having two sets so close together is considered highly unusual. She said: ‘It really was meant to be. ‘To fall pregnant with my second set of twins whilst I was on the contraceptive pill meant that it certainly was fate.

Share this article  Share     ‘To have two sets of twins within 14 months of each other is astounding - and it took a while to sink in.' Miss Wright had been shocked when she
 learnt she was expecting her first set of twins, who had been conceived
 without fertility treatment. She went for a scan and the sonographer announced that she could see two heart beats. Miss Wright, a full time mother, said: ‘I 
wasn’t expecting to be told that I was pregnant with twins. So it was a 
shock. But once we got over the shock, I was looking forward to having 
two babies.’       The odds of having two sets of twins are 1 in 700,000 - but having two sets so close together is considered highly unusual  Harry and Oscar arrived into the world naturally, weighing 2Ib 13oz, and 4Ib 7oz, at Maidstone Hospital, at 32 weeks into her pregnancy. They were in special care for three weeks before being allowed home. The couple hadn’t been planning on extending their family as Miss Wright was then diagnosed with abnormal pre-cancerous cells in her cervix, and she had to undergo treatment to remove them. She said: ‘It was scary. I had two baby boys, and I was having to have treatment to stop these cells growing into full blown cancer.’ But then, despite being on the contraceptive pill, Miss Wright discovered she was pregnant in January 2011.  She said: ‘It was a shock as we hadn’t been trying for another baby and I was still on the pill. When I saw the test result showing positive I was in shock and so was Peter. ‘I was worried that we were having another baby when the twins were so little. But at that stage we never imagined that it could be twins again.’       Miss Wright, who lives in with her partner Peter Podolski, a doorman, said: 'It really was meant to be. 
'To fall pregnant with my second set of twins whilst I was on the contraceptive pill meant that it certainly was fate'  But when Miss Wright went to the hospital for a scan, the sonographer ran the scanner over her stomach, and told the couple that it was twins again. Miss Wright said: ‘I was happy, but I burst into tears again. I was so worried about how I was going to cope with two sets of twins, born so close together. There aren’t any sets of twins in either of our families, so we just don’t know where they came from.’ Miss Wright’s pregnancy went smoothly until 25 weeks into her pregnancy when she went into early labour. Her twins girls Annie and Eliza were born naturally in June 2011 weighing a tiny 1Ib 9oz and 1Ib 8oz. Doctors gave them steroid injections to try and help develop their lungs before the birth. She said: ‘I was so terrified when I went into premature labour with the girls. I was only 25 weeks pregnant and I didn’t know whether they would survive. ‘When I saw them lying there afterwards in their incubators, they were so tiny. Their skin was translucent, and they weren’t much bigger than the palm of my hand.       Miss Wright has to change nappies 16 times a day, she pushes the twins around all together in a four seater buggy, and the family have a seven seater car to get around on family outings  ‘It was nice because the nurses looking after them were the same nurses who had looked after my boys when they were born too.’ Eliza had a malformation in one of her veins which meant that she risked having a brain haemorrage, but she was carefully monitored. The twins gradually got stronger and after three months they were finally allowed home from hospital, weighing 3Ib and 4Ib. Miss Wright said: ‘They were still tiny when we brought them home, but they are such little fighters and are going from strength to strength. Miss Wright has to change nappies 16 times a day, she pushes the twins around all together in a four seater buggy, and the family have a seven seater car to get around on family outings. She added: ‘It is hard work but I love being a mum to two sets of twins. People are always stopping and asking me about them. They can’t believe it when I tell them that both sets of twins were born just 14 months apart. ‘But that is definitely it for me - we aren’t planning any more additions to our family. Two sets of twins is more than enough for anyone.’     Advertisement    Share or comment on this article                    e-mail                             Saudi Arabia threatens to turn Qatar into an ISLAND by...

(YouTube / Gardner Quad Squad)       SHARE share tweet share email    wls Monday, December 29, 2014 A husband and wife in Utah just found out they're about to be parents of quadruplets. Even more rare, the babies are two sets of identical twins.  UPDATE: Viral 'Quad Squad' babies undergo life-saving surgery Four heartbeats plus one hospital clearance equals two happy parents-to-be.  Ashley and Tyson Gardner told CNN they've tried unsuccessfully for eight years to get pregnant. Running out of options, the couple decided to give in-vitro fertilization a try. Her chances of getting pregnant with just a single child was only 40 percent. But when Ashley went in for her first ultrasound, she was given the big news. She was pregnant with a rare set of identical twins, times two. The parents were about to have one of the world's more rare set of quadruplets.   Tap to see video if you're viewing on news app . Doctors estimate twins only occur in about 1 percent of IVF cycles. Only 2 percent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins, medical researchers at the University of Pennsylvania report. And out of those, just 30 percent are identical twins. Doctors put the odds of having two sets of identical twins from different placentas at one in 70 million. But even though its extremely rare, it isn't the first time we've seen two sets of identical twins. Just last year, Tressa and Manuel Montalvo of Houston, Texas gave birth to four boys -- two sets of identical twins -- at The Woman's Hospital of Texas ( read more here ). And in 2011, Miranda and Josh Crawford became parents of identical boys and identical girls in Charlotte, North Carolina ( read more here ). As for the Gardners, they've been sharing updates--like the fact that all four babies will be girls -- on their Facebook page . The page has quadrupled in the number of likes, now at nearly 40,000. The couple tells their new fans they feel blessed by all the love and support they are getting.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Doctors said the chance was 500,000 to one - but how accurate is this estimate? Twinning rates vary around the world, but in the UK there is a 112-to-one chance of a pregnancy resulting in non-identical twins. That's if we don't include babies conceived through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), where twin births occur much more frequently. So in theory the odds of having two sets would be 112 multiplied by 112, which is around 12,500 to one and the odds of having three sets would be 112 cubed, or 1.4 million to one. But it's not quite that simple, because non-identical twins come in clusters.      More or Less: Behind the stats  Listen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free podcast  Download the More or Less podcast  More stories from More or Less  Rolling a six on a dice doesn't suggest that another six is on the way, but having non-identical twins makes more twins much more likely next time. "Family studies have shown that a woman who has had DZ (non-identical) twins is more about four times more likely to have more" in a subsequent pregnancy, than a woman who has not, says Jane Denton, Director of the Multiple Births Foundation. So for a woman who has had one set of non-identical twins, the chance of another set is not 112 to one, but just 28 to one.      Image caption  Rowan and Isla Rodger - the third of three sets of twins   Therefore, the probability of having three sets of non-identical twins is not one in 500,000, but one in 112 x 28 x 28... which is about 88,000. Identical twins are much less common. In the UK, they turn up once in 227 pregnancies on average - again, excluding IVF conceptions - and they do not come in clusters.  Twinning rates around the world       6.2 per 1,000 births in Vietnam (1 in 161)  15.8 per 1,000 births in the UK (1 in 63)  27.9 per 1,000 births in Benin (1 in 36)  33.2 per 1,000 births in the USA (1 in 30)  Source: Plos One    NHS Choices: Pregnant with twins or more  So the chance of three sets of identical twins is 11.7 million to one against. These figures for the UK, however, do not apply to the rest of the world. Twinning rates vary enormously from one country to the next. In Vietnam, on average, there are 6.2 twins per 1,000 births, while in the US there are five times as many - 33.2 per 1,000 births. It's not known why this is but it appears that body composition can influence the chance of having twins. Several studies have shown that for tall women (164cm and over), the relative chance of having twins is between 1.5 and two times higher than for short women (under 155cm). Mothers of twins also have a higher body mass index (BMI) compared to mothers of single children - a BMI of less than 20 is associated with a lower probability of twinning while a BMI of 30 or more is associated with a higher likelihood.  Previously in More or Less      Since the Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to hospital with acute morning sickness - hyperemesis gravidarum - there has been a great deal of speculation about the possibility of her having twins. But what are the chances?  Royal baby: What are the odds of twins? (December 2012)  There is also evidence that the chance of having twins increases the later a mother gives birth. Experts think this happens because of a change in hormonal signals sent between pituitary gland and the ovary. In the UK, the odds of having any kind of twins at any age is one in 63 but these odds reduce to one in 46 once a woman is older than 35, and one in 18 if a woman conceives after the age of 45. A number of studies have shown that in several countries seasonal variation influences non-identical twinning. There are higher rates of conception during the summer and autumn. One theory put forward is that day length may influence hormonal concentrations driving ovarian activity and influence fertility and multiple ovulation. A study by Johan Fellman and Aldur Eriksson at the Folkhalsan Institute of Genetics in Helsinki also suggests that changes in food supply during different seasons may also contribute.

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.

Some couples say they’d love the chance to parent two babies and others react in an entirely different way.  If you are a twin or have twin siblings then your concept of the reality is likely to be very different to someone who’s never had anything to do with more than one baby at a time.  Are twins common?  Many reproductive experts believe that as humans we probably have more twin pregnancies than any of us are aware of. Technological advances have found that it is reasonably common for there to be more than one embryo conceived and implanted, but of these, only one is viable and survives.  How do twins happen?  If you are keen to increase your chances of conceiving two babies then it’s important to understand how twins are made.  There are two types of twins; identical and non-identical. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one egg is fertilized by one sperm which then divides into two separate embryos.  Each shares exactly the same genetic components and identical genetic structures. Identical twins also share a placenta.  Non-identical or dizygotic twins form from two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. These twins are their own unique little individuals and share no more genetic composition than siblings with the same parents. Each baby in a non-identical twin pair will have its own placenta.  Another name for non-identical twins is fraternal; the other name for identical twins is non-fraternal.  What about twins in families?  Twins do run in families. But the genetic predisposition for having twins only applies to the mother. It is her family history which influences the chances of her having hyper ovulation.  Any woman can have identical twins and family history does not play a role with these.  What are the odds of having twins?  Currently in Australia 1.6% of all pregnancies result in multiple births and of these, 98% are twins.  Naturally conceived twins occur once in around every eighty nine births.  The majority of twins who are born are non identical and a result of two eggs being fertilised.  Some fraternal twins look very similar; others share some resemblance whilst the remainder may not even look the slightest bit related.  What will help boost my chances of having twins?   Being older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters peri-menopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. Fertility research has proven that twin pregnancies are much more common in women who are over 35 years. But this only applies to non-identical twins.  Have fertility assistance such as in vitro fertilisation or take fertility drugs. These stimulate the ovaries to support more than one ovarian follicle each month towards maturity. The result is that more than one egg is released.  Pick your own genetics carefully! Though we all know this is impossible. But if you come from a family where non-identical twins are common then your family history and genetic endowment means that you’ve got a greater chance of having them yourself. But identical twins can occur in any family.  Be of African/American heritage. Women from this ethnic background have a distinctly higher rate of twin pregnancies.  Having been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.  Have a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.  Get pregnant while you are on the pill. Difficult as this can be overall, there is a higher incidence of women conceiving with twins when they are on oral contraceptives.  Try to conceive straight after you have stopped taking the pill. The theory is that for the first couple of cycles the woman’s body is going through a hormonal readjustment phase.  Already have a set of twins. Because the likelihood of conceiving with twins again is higher in women who’ve already had them.  Be heavier rather than lighter so that you’ve got a higher body mass index ( BMI ). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.  Taller women tend to conceive more twins. But there is nothing you can do about your height, other than blame your parents!  Take a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.  Encourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.  Be a twin yourself. Mothers who are twins are more likely to have twin babies. There is no influence on the male partner’s side, only the mother’s. But it does seem that fathers may pass the twin gene onto their daughters for their future conception possibilities.  Eat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.  Keep breastfeeding your older baby or toddler. Women who are producing prolactin and breastfeeding are more likely to conceive with twins. Though some women do not resume regular ovulation and menstrual cycles for the entire time they are breastfeeding; this is very individual.   What’s fact and what’s fiction when having twins?   The idea that conceiving twins skips a generation is not true. Although there can appear to be a pattern in some families of this happening, the odds of having identical twins is the same for every woman.  Eating a diet which is high in dairy foods, milk and meat is said to help, especially at the time of ovulation. But there is no scientific evidence to support this.  Alternative therapies do not increase the likelihood. There is no scientific evidence to support the theory that accupuncture, naturopathy, aromatherapy, chiropractic or flower essences increase the likelihood of having twins.

Share          Expert Answer       The BabyCentre editorial team  Our panel of health writers     Non-identical (fraternal) twins tend to run in families. But identical twins don't.  Non-identical twins are the result of two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. There is a gene that makes a woman more likely to release two or more eggs during ovulation, and it's this gene that runs in families. Identical twins are the result of a single fertilised egg splitting, and this seems to be a random event.  So if you're a woman and non-identical twins run in your family, you're more likely to have a set yourself. It's estimated that you're about two and a half times more likely than average to have twins if you're a non-identical twin, or have siblings who are non-identical twins.  A man with a family history of twins may carry the gene, but it won't mean he can father a set of non-identical twins. The gene is only expressed through women who ovulate. If he has daughters, they may inherit the gene, and one day go on to have fraternal twins.  This may explain why some people think that twins skip a generation in families. You may have heard, for example, that if your mum or dad is a twin but you're not, you're more likely to have twins yourself. There's no evidence to support this. What can happen, though, is that a dad can pass on the non-identical twin gene to his daughters and this may make twins appear to skip a generation.  Your heritage can affect your chances of having twins. For example, non-identical twins are most common in women of Central African origin, and least common in women of South-East Asian and Latin American origin.  Aside from inheritance, age plays a big role in how likely you are to have twins. If you're a woman in your mid-30s or beyond, you have a greater chance than a younger woman of having twins or more. As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which could trigger your ovaries to release several eggs each month.  The use of some fertility treatments also increases the likelihood of a woman having twins. All treatments that stimulate the ovaries to release eggs or involve two or more embryos being transferred to the womb increase the chance of multiple births.

Reply  Close F  Faininator @Ms450f  She said boy/girl so fraternal. Fraternal aren't genetic like identical twins, although the gene for hyper ovulation is passed down genetically so, it's very likely if you've hyper ovulated once or carry the gene, you will do so again. This is why I had my tubes tied after our twins bc we have 3 under 1 and an 11 year old and my doctor told me if I got pregnant again the chances would be much higher that I'd hyper ovulate again and have another set of twins. It's much more uncommon to see people with two sets of identicals. Reply  Close D  DoubleUnicornPoo @Faininator  Fraternal are the type that CAN have a genetic component. Identical are pure chance (at least based on current science). Your chances of having a second set of fraternal twins is about 8%, up from the 1-3% chance the general population has of having twins.

The chances of a 2nd set of fraternals is 1 in 12 which sounds really high but works out to about 8% (up from the 1-3% that the general populace has of having twins). The chances of having 2 sets of identicals is 1 in 70,000. That's 0.000014%. Reply  Close B  Bb386 I have 2 singletons but lost di-di twins between them at 15 and 23 weeks respectively (the former due to selective reduction after a severe chromosomal abnormality diagnosis, and the latter due to preterm labour from an infection I developed from one of the many invasive procedures I had during that pregnancy). I'm currently expecting another set of di-di twins mid-August (thankfully going much better this time). All 4 pregnancies happened in 4.5 years between the ages of 25-30 with no family history of twinning and no predisposing factors other than my height. I've heard chances of di-di twins after the first set is 1 in 12, but I tend to think some women hyperovulate more often than that and the data doesn't reflect it because most women stop having children after a few singles and/or multiples.

Even with fraternals you still have a good chance because of hyper ovulation (which is genetically passed down) They don't know a whole lot about twins honestly (which makes them so amazing and special) my doctor told me to be careful if I didn't plan on a tubal after I deliver this time bc my chances of conceiving twins again would be high and more likely to hyper ovulate again. I'll have 3 babies under 1 here any day so we don't want that to happen right now lol Reply  Close D  DoubleUnicornPoo @Faininator  There's actually no known genetic component to identical twins. Having identical twins does not increase your chance of having twins again. Fraternal twins are the ones with the genetic component to hyperovulate (although not everyone who hyperovulates has a genetic predisposition to).

Reply  Close m  mainemommatobe @francesnell  Those look like Di/Di twins - meaning that you hyperovulated and had two eggs fertilized by two sperm. They have their own placentas and their own sacs/homes. In this case, they are most likely to be fraternal. There is a small chance however that they could be identical if the egg split super early on (day 1-3).

By Stephanie / 5						COMMENTS  111 Shares    Most moms consider themselves lucky enough to have one set of twins, but if you’re incredibly lucky, then you might even end up with two pairs of twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice?    What are the chances of having twins? The birth rate for twins is only going up, rising by as much as 76% in the last 30 years. That means that your chance of having twins in the USA is as high as 3 in 100 births. But that’s fraternal twins. The chance of identical twins is the same as it’s always been, which is around 3 in 1000 babies born as identical twins. So what are the chances of having twins twice? Obviously, the chance of having two sets of twins is pretty rare, but it’s not as rare as you might think. If you’re looking for two sets of twins of any type, the chance of that is around 1 in 3,000, which is the same chance as getting struck by lightning during your life!   A set of identical twins and fraternal twins is only around 1 in 10,000, or the same odds that you’re going to fall off your toilet and end up in hospital! Having two sets of identical twins is pretty damn unlikely, with only 1 chance in 70,000. Bear in mind that if you’ve already got one set of twins, you might actually be more likely to have a second set, because of all of the things that increase your chances of twin births. Things like: Having already been pregnant before. Women who have already had a baby, including women who have already had twins, are more likely to have twins in the future! Getting older. Women over the age of around 35 have more twins in general, because in the few years before you hit peri-menopause, your ovaries start to release more than one egg at a time. Having some sort of fertility treatment, like IVF or fertility drugs. These sort of things can stimulate your body to produce multiple eggs over and over. Coming from a family with twins in it. There’s some sort of genetic component to twins, and if twins run in your family, then you’re more likely to have them. This also means that if you’ve had twins once, they might run in your family and you might have them again! Being on the pill, or just coming off of the pill. Apparently, the hormonal changes that the pill causes in women can increase their chances of having twins. Being taller or heavier than average. Taller and heavier women have a greater than normal chance of having twins . But remember to stay healthy! Make sure your partner has a lot of zinc in his diet. Zinc contributes to healthy sperm, and the healthier your partner’s sperm, the more you have of chance of conceiving twins! Twins are getting more and more common, so if you have one set of twins and you’re going for another, you might just get lucky! How do you think you would cope with two sets of twins? Do you know anyone who actually has two sets of twins? Or maybe you’re one of the incredibly fortunate women who beat the odds and has an awesome foursome! Let us know in the comments below!        Nicole  says: October 25, 2017 at 10:20 pm I actually know 2 people within 30 mins of each other who have 2 pairs of twins! Reply   Deidre Turner  says: November 17, 2017 at 5:01 am Me! I’m 17 weeks pregnant with my second set of twins (both di/di). My first set were conceived with the assistance of fertility treatment (IUI), then I had a singleton conceived naturally and I’m pregnant with twins again, conceived naturally this time. I’m not particularly tall or big, I’m under 35 (currently 34 and was 29 having my first set), I haven’t been on the pill for years and hubby’s sperm counts are ok but not great. I’ve only been pregnant 3 times. I was on only 25mg (half a tablet) of clomid for 4 cycles over 5 years ago so that’s all the fertility drugs I ever took. It explains the first set but not the second set. I think that family history is my biggest influence; my nanna had 2 sets of twins and a set of triplets; my mum is one of the triplets. I’m the only one in my large extended family who has had any multiples at all so it looks like the twin gene skipped straight to me!

So, the basic answer is "yes" you have a slightly higher chance of conceiving twins again if you conceived fraternal twins naturally....other factors up the chances.  We've had plenty of moms here go on to have just singletons after twins, and we've had a few have twins again.  A good breakdown though is to look at Michelle Duggar.Â  She has 19 children, and had 1 miscarriage.Â  Out of those 20 conceptions, 2 times were fraternal twins so she's been pregnant 17 times...so in 1 inÂ 8.5 pregnancies for her, she had twins.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Momoftwins628 · Original Poster    Last edited 07/23/2011      Well im overweight and also african american (we have a higher rate of twins) and also twins run in my family....so how do you know if you "hyperovulate" ?

I can always tell when I've ovulated, because I've always been able to feel it.Â  There are some months I feel it on both sides, and some only on one side, but even then, one ovary can release multiple eggs.  Sooooo, unless you're hooked up to an ultrasound machine during your ovulation time every month there's no way to "know" 100% if you've hyperovulated or not.  It's a craps shoot unfortunately.Â You should be able to ask for an ultrasound based on your history ofÂ having twins though.Â  Good luck!Â    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB             Reply            Report this comment       0                     MOMWM    Last edited 07/23/2011      I have 5 and a half year old frat's and 1 yo frats.Â  Would love to try and have number 5 but my dh  (dear husband) is worried about number 5 being 5 and 6.Â  Second time around is much easier.

The statistics are somewhat irrelevant, because I believe they are very inaccurate. We never thought we'd have a second set of twins b/c our first was identical, and that is supposedly a random occurance. Surprise, surprise! A second set of identical twins.The statistical odds of that are 1 in 70,000 - based on 1 in 250 births is monozygotic twins - but I hypothesize it is probably more likely than 1 in 250 to have a second set of identical twins. After hearing about families with 2,3 and even 4 sets of MZ twins as the ONLY children, I think some moms just always have MZ twins. I think I may be one of them...so far hubby is not willing to find out though! There is some research being done on this somewhere.  As for fraternals, yes, there more likely to have a second set too, statistically I have heard 1/10,000 to have 2 sets, but I have heard once you have 1 set, it is 1/5 you would have another.  Most moms of twins don't have genetic testing done and I think they are conditioned to believe their twins are fraternal because moms are so keen to the slight differences in appearance and the obvious differences in personality. I think alot of moms out there actually have identical twins but think they are fraternal.  Â    --  Mom to 2 sets of identical twin girls plus a 'spare' (baby girl #5 that is!)

Â  There has been new research in the past few years on identical twins that shows it is not as random as they thought...it is genetic. Â But it is a combination of the parents.

Do you know for sure that they were ID twins??  The reason I ask is based on the research that I have done the only 100% way to know is through dna testing.  And I believe that if frat twins implant very close together they can have the appearance of looking identical.  The placentas can fuse together also giving the appearance of two babies sharing one placenta.  If by some chance your twins were actually fraternal and not identical then you definately have increased odds of concieving twins again.  But ID's are a fluke of nature with no statistical evidence to suggest that once you have one set you are more likely to have another.  Again I am very sorry for your loss.  And good luck for a wonderful healthy pregnancy this time! :)    --  Jennifer, mom to 4 great kids and twins, Sam and Livy born January 14, 2009 at 37 weeks!

It does happen, but I have never met anyone with 2 set of id twins.  There a few ways of knowing for sure if your twins are id or fraternal while pregnant:  b/g- fraternal  or  the babies share an amionic sac and placenta.  or  DNA test  THe implantation of the twins will not necessary tell you anything. Identical who split early can have placentas on opposites sides of the uterus (there is a lady on the "got twins" board who was told no doubt that her boys were fraternal b/c of the placenta placement,  dna test confirmed her boys were id) Also, fraternal can have fussed placenta if the placenta form too close. So, if you had same sex twins, you would not know for sure.

There is no medically possible way to have b/g identical twins...identical is identical...you can't have matching dna is you aren't the same sex.  It is common sense.  I know this because I have done research..and I have girl identical twins.  I had a very rough pregnancy...I had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome...and I lost one of my little girls at 27 weeks..and delivered my other daughter at 27 weeks.  I just want to let others know that if you are prego with identical twins...please becareful and go to a high risk pregnancy doctor.  And get your babies checked often.  Good luck!

I think that you meant to say identical not fraternal. Fraternal can not be monoamniotic- only identical. Fraternal are from 2 separate eggs. Identical are 1 egg that splits.  Also, very unluckly that you have b/g identical twins. It can happen, but is very rare. There are a few documented cases. Google it. If it happens, the girl will not make it b/ of chromosomal abnormalities. So, more likely than not,  if you have b/g twins, they are fraternal. They may look a lot alike.  Jill- I'm sorry for your loss.    --  ~~Emily ~~ Momma to wild and crazy identical twins!- Calum and Liam- 1/24/08 and sweet baby girl Audrey 7/25/11             Reply            Report this comment       0                     c&ltwinmommy;    Posted 05/18/2009      National Geographic did a multiples dvd.

But, when reading the below, keep in mind that Michelle Duggar who has 18 children, only has 2 sets of twins!  Here's some good information:  Factors that Influence Twins Twins can occur naturally in any woman at any time. However, there are certain factors that increase your chances of having twins. These factors include:     Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably.    Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins.    Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. Women produce more ovulation-stimulating hormone as they age, increasing your chance of releasing more than one egg during ovulation. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39.    Previous Twins: If you’ve already had twins, it is more likely that you will have another twin pregnancy.    Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.    Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, women can increase their chances of having twins up to 20%.    Weight Gain : A study by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology linked the recent rise in multiple births with the steady rise of obesity in North America. Women with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 are more likely to have twins than those in the suggested BMI range of 19 to 25.     --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     j_l_badders    Posted 02/06/2009      I heard its more likely with fraternal than identicalsince fraternal is about releasing more than one egg and identical is a by chance thing with the egg splitting but I read somewhere (have no clue where now) while I was pregnant that its more than a 50% after fraternal but that doesn't seem likely???I do however know a 2x twin mom so yeah it happens.

But again, the chances are not 50% like some people think...again, Michelle Duggar has only had 2 sets of twins among her 18 children, and they were pretty far apart with several singletons in between.    --  Michelle GO  BHB , Got Twins? , Colorado , MTAM  Amanda 10/14/89 , Emily & Sarah  2/18/04  Mom~The Don of the BHB                     Report this comment        5                     tazzersize2000 · Original Poster    Posted 02/06/2009      wow!  a co-worker at my old job had one kid then had a set of twins!!???mommytotwingirls do you plan on having any other children?

I heard from someone you can do a test to see if you ovulate two eggs every time.  If that is that case you can always do IVF  (in vitro fertilization) and put in one egg.  A friend of a friend wants to do this because her twins were born very early because of a problem she has and does not want to risk having another set of twins and losing them both.    --  JAM DS 1/2005 , DD 12/2006 Twins!

Because your twins are naturally occuring (I have ID girls as well) the odds of you having another set are fairly high, but they taper off as time goes. The window they recommend is after 3 years, then the odds drop to almost nothing. I cannot remember the exact percentages but they were enough to keep me from forgetting to take my Seasonale daily. My MOMs group as one lady who had a single, twins, twins then triplets and another who had DD, twin Ds, and then triplet Ds in the hopes of having a boy. Even had the sperm spun. Now, most of those births are under 2 years apart. The nomotc.org has some stats on this I'm sure. I waited and now I think I'm done because we kicked diapers and now that I know how wonderful it can be, I don't think I can ever go back to the diaper phase! Hope this helps!!!

I am not sure at what age, 30 something. I was 38 when I got pregnant for the first time with twins. I lost those babies and got pregnant again soon afterwards and I now have triplets.  I have also read that if your twins are identical your chance of another set is not that high the next.

I was very much interested in the same thing. Not that I would be upset by a second set of twins, but I wanted to know what the odds were. Since my guys are identical and there is no family hx of twins (I know that doesn't always rule out the possiblity) I feel comfortible that if we do ttc again, it will be a single.    --  ~~Emily ~~ Momma to wild and crazy identical twins!- Calum and Liam- 1/24/08 and sweet baby girl Audrey 7/25/11             Reply            Report this comment        1                     Lindsey S    Posted 09/29/2008      I'm so curious and nervous about this subject, too.  Ours are unknown whether identical or fraternal, but they were our first children, so we might want to have more someday.  I'm not as afraid of having twins themselves as I am of repeating the whole bedrest, preterm labor, premie babies, etc. thing!    --  Lindsey 32w6d twins Liberty & Mia 3/31/08, 36w3d healthy boy Maximus born 8/4/11             Reply            Report this comment        1                     Nannners    Posted 10/01/2008      I did some research on this too.  Princesso has it right, if you ahve fraternal twins, and you become pregnant again, it's like a 1 in 4 or 1in 5 shot you'll have twins, again!  I have 3 year old identical G/G twins (as confirmed by DNA cheek swab), so I thought that there's no chance I'd ever have twins again -especially since there are NO twins in my family and I just turned 30.  WRONG!!!!  Here I am, having my second set of twins! We do not yet know if the yare ID or Frat...but will certainly find out.  I came across the same statistic as c winmommy, that having 2 sets of ID twins is a 1 in 70,000 shot.  However, one set ID and one set FRAT are only 1 in 10,000.  Either way, a long shot, but here I am - living proof that it does happen!  So, in my local twins club seom of the moms have told me they just read something - somewhere -about how some women have a propensity to have identical twins...something about an enzyme or protein or something.  I'd love to hear from anyone that knows about this!  Or anyone working on their second set of twins for that matter!

Sara - I was told by both my doctor and the nurses in the hospital that the genetic component for twins runs on the mothers side only (twins on your DH's side or your father's side wouldn't matter) because it has everything to do with the egg, not the sperm.

Undo Answer Wiki 4 Answers   Nikhil Dandekar , Datacurious Answered Nov 17, 2015 · Author has 193 answers and 779.6k answer views If you have had fraternal twins already, your chance of having another set is 1 in 3000 . This is because most women who conceive fraternals show a pattern of releasing more than one egg per cycle. The odds of having one set of identicals and one set of fraternals is 1 in 10,000. If a woman has one set of identicals, her chance of having another is 1 in 70,000 or less. The odds of having 3 sets of twins, of any kind, is 1 in 500,000.

Ask New Question   Pat Harkin , Got a genetic degree years ago so most of what they taught me is now wrong. Updated Nov 18, 2015 · Author has 8.2k answers and 5.9m answer views There is an increased  chance that a woman will have non-identical (fraternal or dizygotic ) twins if her female ancestors did. There is no similar increase in the case of identical (monozygotic) twins. Do twins run in families? To have fraternal twins, a woman must release more than one egg at a time and the tendency to do this seems to have an inherited component. Identical twin arise when a fertilise egg/early embryo splits in two. I don't know why this happens and I can't find a decent explanation (though it's not my field so I could be looking in the wrong places.) [EDIT] The question and details have been edited, so here's some more info. "What is the chance of a woman having a set of twins?" is a REALLY tricky question to answer. It's very easy to answer the question "What is the chance of a woman's next pregnancy producing a set of twins?" (about 1 in 90 pre-IVF days, about 1 in 40 now) but unless you know the answer to the question "What is the chance of a woman becoming pregnant?" you can't multiply through. Things get even more complicated when you ask "What's the chance of a second set of twins?" A lot of people with twins say "That's enough!" The chance of a woman's first two pregnancies (implicit in this is the assumption that there will be two) naturally resulting in twins is about 1 in 90 (first pregnancy) time "a bit more than" 1 in 90 (second pregnancy) or around 1 in 8000.  The chance of the first two pregnancies of any woman being twins is therefore around 1 in 8000, but the chance of a set of twins resulting from the next pregnancy in a woman who already has one set is better than 1 in 90. The differences arise because of the  difference between the events which have already occurred, i.e. don't need to have their probability estimated (it's 1.0) Consider the questions "What is the chance of  tossing a fair coin twice and getting heads? (One in four) against "I  tossed a coin and got heads. What is the chance the second toss will  also give heads?

But the surprise was more than most for Stacey Wright who gave birth to two sets of twins within 14 months. The 29-year old was stunned when she discovered she was pregnant with her second set of twins - despite being on the contraceptive pill. Miss Wright, who lives in Maidstone, Kent, with her partner Peter Podolski, 28, a doorman, first had sons Harry and Oscar in April 2010.       Stacey Wright and her partner Peter Podolski were stunned when they discovered she discovered she was pregnant with her second set of twins - despite being on the contraceptive pill. Sons Harry and Oscar (left to right) arrived in in April 2010 and she had daughters Annie and Eliza (left to right) prematurely in June 2011  But the following January she was astonished to hear she was pregnant again - with more twins. And she went on to deliver daughters Annie and Eliza prematurely in June 2011. The odds of having two sets of twins are 1 in 700,000 - but having two sets so close together is considered highly unusual. She said: ‘It really was meant to be. ‘To fall pregnant with my second set of twins whilst I was on the contraceptive pill meant that it certainly was fate.

Share this article  Share     ‘To have two sets of twins within 14 months of each other is astounding - and it took a while to sink in.' Miss Wright had been shocked when she
 learnt she was expecting her first set of twins, who had been conceived
 without fertility treatment. She went for a scan and the sonographer announced that she could see two heart beats. Miss Wright, a full time mother, said: ‘I 
wasn’t expecting to be told that I was pregnant with twins. So it was a 
shock. But once we got over the shock, I was looking forward to having 
two babies.’       The odds of having two sets of twins are 1 in 700,000 - but having two sets so close together is considered highly unusual  Harry and Oscar arrived into the world naturally, weighing 2Ib 13oz, and 4Ib 7oz, at Maidstone Hospital, at 32 weeks into her pregnancy. They were in special care for three weeks before being allowed home. The couple hadn’t been planning on extending their family as Miss Wright was then diagnosed with abnormal pre-cancerous cells in her cervix, and she had to undergo treatment to remove them. She said: ‘It was scary. I had two baby boys, and I was having to have treatment to stop these cells growing into full blown cancer.’ But then, despite being on the contraceptive pill, Miss Wright discovered she was pregnant in January 2011.  She said: ‘It was a shock as we hadn’t been trying for another baby and I was still on the pill. When I saw the test result showing positive I was in shock and so was Peter. ‘I was worried that we were having another baby when the twins were so little. But at that stage we never imagined that it could be twins again.’       Miss Wright, who lives in with her partner Peter Podolski, a doorman, said: 'It really was meant to be. 
'To fall pregnant with my second set of twins whilst I was on the contraceptive pill meant that it certainly was fate'  But when Miss Wright went to the hospital for a scan, the sonographer ran the scanner over her stomach, and told the couple that it was twins again. Miss Wright said: ‘I was happy, but I burst into tears again. I was so worried about how I was going to cope with two sets of twins, born so close together. There aren’t any sets of twins in either of our families, so we just don’t know where they came from.’ Miss Wright’s pregnancy went smoothly until 25 weeks into her pregnancy when she went into early labour. Her twins girls Annie and Eliza were born naturally in June 2011 weighing a tiny 1Ib 9oz and 1Ib 8oz. Doctors gave them steroid injections to try and help develop their lungs before the birth. She said: ‘I was so terrified when I went into premature labour with the girls. I was only 25 weeks pregnant and I didn’t know whether they would survive. ‘When I saw them lying there afterwards in their incubators, they were so tiny. Their skin was translucent, and they weren’t much bigger than the palm of my hand.       Miss Wright has to change nappies 16 times a day, she pushes the twins around all together in a four seater buggy, and the family have a seven seater car to get around on family outings  ‘It was nice because the nurses looking after them were the same nurses who had looked after my boys when they were born too.’ Eliza had a malformation in one of her veins which meant that she risked having a brain haemorrage, but she was carefully monitored. The twins gradually got stronger and after three months they were finally allowed home from hospital, weighing 3Ib and 4Ib. Miss Wright said: ‘They were still tiny when we brought them home, but they are such little fighters and are going from strength to strength. Miss Wright has to change nappies 16 times a day, she pushes the twins around all together in a four seater buggy, and the family have a seven seater car to get around on family outings. She added: ‘It is hard work but I love being a mum to two sets of twins. People are always stopping and asking me about them. They can’t believe it when I tell them that both sets of twins were born just 14 months apart. ‘But that is definitely it for me - we aren’t planning any more additions to our family. Two sets of twins is more than enough for anyone.’     Advertisement    Share or comment on this article                    e-mail                             Saudi Arabia threatens to turn Qatar into an ISLAND by...

(YouTube / Gardner Quad Squad)       SHARE share tweet share email    wls Monday, December 29, 2014 A husband and wife in Utah just found out they're about to be parents of quadruplets. Even more rare, the babies are two sets of identical twins.  UPDATE: Viral 'Quad Squad' babies undergo life-saving surgery Four heartbeats plus one hospital clearance equals two happy parents-to-be.  Ashley and Tyson Gardner told CNN they've tried unsuccessfully for eight years to get pregnant. Running out of options, the couple decided to give in-vitro fertilization a try. Her chances of getting pregnant with just a single child was only 40 percent. But when Ashley went in for her first ultrasound, she was given the big news. She was pregnant with a rare set of identical twins, times two. The parents were about to have one of the world's more rare set of quadruplets.   Tap to see video if you're viewing on news app . Doctors estimate twins only occur in about 1 percent of IVF cycles. Only 2 percent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins, medical researchers at the University of Pennsylvania report. And out of those, just 30 percent are identical twins. Doctors put the odds of having two sets of identical twins from different placentas at one in 70 million. But even though its extremely rare, it isn't the first time we've seen two sets of identical twins. Just last year, Tressa and Manuel Montalvo of Houston, Texas gave birth to four boys -- two sets of identical twins -- at The Woman's Hospital of Texas ( read more here ). And in 2011, Miranda and Josh Crawford became parents of identical boys and identical girls in Charlotte, North Carolina ( read more here ).

                )   8  12  0   Hi, I was just curious on if anyone has had more than one set of twins naturally?  I keep hearing stories about how after having one set of twins your chances are double for having another set.   We already have a 4 year old son and our 4 month set of fraternal twin boys.  We are debating another in 2-3 years but not sure I could handle another set of twins (even though my husband feels differently ... lol)  So I was just curious... thanks!

LOTS of twins! But, they've all been identical, up until mine... And what do you know, my cousin had b/g twins, like me, 3 months after I did! Side note, I conceived my twins on my 22nd birthday, using no fertility (was actually on birth control...), and weighed about 120lbs. Which means I did not meet age, weight, or fertility drug risk factors... and twins TECHNICALLY didn't run in my family, since they were ALL identical girls! I SO want another baby, but my husband is afraid to get another set of twins... I'm all for it, one way or the other!

My chances were 75% with the 1st set being identical. Now I am at 90% after my 2nd set if I should go again (which I will not be). So once you've had a set your chances do increase throughtout the years. Hope that helped. :)          Helpful  (7)    Nice  (1)    Funny  (1)    Encouraging  (2)    Hugs  (1)            Joan -  posted on 08/03/2009   3  21  0   It can happen!!!  My husband and I have two sets of twins...all girls!  Our first set is identical, they are 2 1/2 years old now and our second set was fraternal, they are almost 3 months.  We used no fertality drugs, it was all natural!  We wanted one more and never thought it would happen again, I mean what are the odds!?!  I'm a stay at home mom and it is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, I'm exhausted to say the least but I know they won't be this little forever.  My husband and I feel so blessed and wouldn't change a thing, they are our pride and joy!  I believe God only gives you what you can handle...

My sets are all natural and I'm African American. And through a ancestry research my family found out we were kin to a tribe that came from Africa that was made up of several family's of twins through my mother's side they came to America and rooted in Tennessee. Where my mother's side is from. We have 35 sets of twins in our family that we know of. The Drs. say that my chances of having more are high. So it is possible. And when you have fraternal twins ihe chances are greater for more twins.

I have a 9 year old boy and fraternal 15 month old boys as well. chances go up with age for identical not fraternal thats just in your genes, but yes once you have a set of FRATERNAL more than likely you will have multiples again because its in your genes...          Helpful     Nice     Funny     Encouraging     Hugs             Donnelle -  posted on 05/01/2012   0  0  0   I think about this all the time. I am only 23 years old and am 30 weeks pregnant with twin boys. They haven't been able to tell yet whether they are identical or fraternal. I have heard that once you have multiples, your chances of having another set go up. Plus, your chances go up with age. And fraternal twins run in my family. We get a set every generation. So all these factors together make me not want anymore kids, since I already have a 2 year old boy, and I don't know if I could do another set of twins.. If I do have more, I want to wait til all the other kids are in school. But yeah, it's frustrating. I would absolutely love to have a little girl one day. But that's the thing, I only want one. lol          Helpful     Nice     Funny     Encouraging     Hugs             Michelle -  posted on 04/24/2012   20  1  0   When my daughter  had her boys they told that if she got pregnant again she would either have twins again or triplets, she was 20 and her first pregnancy!!

We were told by my ob that its 80% chance of concieving another multiple birth and not just twins. At my 6 week checkup after the twins were born and i was breast feeding them both and my ob told me i was about to ovulate again. I was in fairy land, twins were still in hospital and everything was up in the air as they came early so i thought my cycle would be all over the shop but to ovulate that quick dumbfounded me.

I had identical twin girls in 2005,no fertilization, all natural, from god! My GYN doctor kept saying,"we see only one and we hear one heartbeat." I was huge! (The twin gene is on my mom's side and has never skipped a generation, she always said either my brother or my twin sister, or myself would have twins). I knew from 2 months along there were twins in me. My doctor said I had less than a 1% change of having twins as identical twins don't have the gene for having twins, only fraternal twins carry the trait. I guess I was in the less than 1%. He said now that I had a set, my chances grew to over 50% for having a second set. I had already had a one year old when my twins were born and now the chance of having a second set of twins in the future, I ended up having my tubes tied and daddy fixed to for double safety!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love all my girls, they are my angels, but I could not imagine 5 children under the age of 3. You are correct in the %, it does double. By the way, if you had fraternal twins, then the gene is somewhere on your side. The Fraternal gene is passed on the female side, and the fraternal percent is 60%. I did a research paper on the twin gene for curiousity in 2008 to see how rare it was for me to have twins. What I did was unheard of, or very very rare. Sounds to me you have a great chance of having a second set! Which I might ad, every child is definitely a blessing.

One baby seems so easy!  Although the plus side of twins is that my boys are great friends and always have each other.  so they always have someone to play with.  i find my twins now at 7 are easier than when my daughter was 7 because she was always bored if she had no one to play with.

We'd been trying for 2 years without success and once we did get pregnant, sadly we had a miscarriage. So we tried IUI, without any fertility medications and it worked on the 1st try! We found out we were pregnant with twins at our 8 week ultrasound and our Dr. was super surprised! She told us to expect the babies to be fraternal due to my "advanced maternal age" (all of 35) where I'd ovulated more than 1 egg. So after our boys were born, we all thought something was weird because they looked super-identical! We did a DNA swab test and found out they are in fact identical. Our Dr. says that having identical twins is a rare occurence, but it is possible to have another set, identical or fraternal. My husband and I are now looking to do IUI again in the fall and hope we'll be blessed with another healthy baby...although my husband is really nervous of having twins again! Our Dr. has reassured us that although we're at a higher 'risk' for a 2nd mutliple pregnancy, she feels as I do that we're strong and loving and if it happens again, how amazing would that be? I wish you all the best.

This is because most women who conceive fraternals (without fertility drugs) show a pattern of releasing more than one egg per cycle. Your chance of a second set numerically, is about 1 in 3000 The odds of having one set of identicals and one set of fraternals is 1 in 10,000. If a woman has one set of identicals, her chance of having another is 1 in 70,000 or less. The odds of having 3 sets of twins, of any kind, is 1 in 500,000. With identical twins I can almost guarantee you wont have another set of identical. If you do make sure you contact some scientists and make some money. but you MAY conceive fraternals if you hyperovulate..

I was told the likelihood of having another set of twins was remotely small.  At our first ultrasound, there was just one baby.  Later we found out it was a little girl.  But we were caught by surprise by another pregnancy...Fraternal twins, a boy and a girl.  Odds are just that...odds.  Many women decide after having a set of twins that they have enough children.  So they of course do not have another set of twins, but they are still figured in to the odds calculations.  Who knows...if they chose to conceive again, perhaps it would be twins, perhaps not.

Identicals are the result of the fertilized egg splitting, but it is possible that there are genetic factors that cause the egg to be capable of splitting. I think that, though there is no proof, there is plenty of evidence that identicals, though occasionally spontaneous, can also be genetic. My friend is an identical twin and he had identical twin girls. I have heard of this same thing happening many times. I have heard (although rarely, yet still happens) that there are multiple sets of identicals born to the same parents. It is proven that having fraternals greatly increases your chances but as far as identicals, nothing can be proven either way. The rate does not seem to increase with identicals so it is likely that the chances do not increase.

Since yours are identical, I'd guess type chances are lower, but still higher than someone with only singletons.

Identical twins occur when the egg splits while fraternal twins occur from a mother dropping 2 eggs.  My male cousin has a set of identical twin girls, which has no bearing on my childbearing.  Other than that I have the only set of twins on both of my parents sides, however there are a large number of my aunts and female cousins that had miscarriages in the years before ultrasounds were available.  My daughters are at an increased risk of having multiples while my sons' daughters' will have a slightly increased risk.  My twins were barely 4 mths old when we found out we were expecting again, matter fact I was at the doctors to get on birth control, and I nearly passed out.  Had an ultrasound the next day and it was only 1.  We had our last child 2 years ago today, and we were entirely too scared to try for more since I am definitely aging and the chances are higher          Helpful     Nice     Funny     Encouraging  (1)    Hugs                Melissa -  posted on 05/24/2010   192  11  11   oh & they are a mixed couple white mom black dad          Helpful     Nice     Funny     Encouraging     Hugs             Melissa -  posted on 05/24/2010   192  11  11   so it just depends on you & your husband a lady at my daughter's gymnastics class has a daughter then they had twin girls so it depends on the parents & the family line but then again that dont mean anything because a family with mo history of twins at all could have twins          Helpful     Nice     Funny     Encouraging     Hugs             Melissa -  posted on 05/24/2010   192  11  11   a girl on my myspace page has 3 sets of twins & 2 single births all by the same guy. & he has 3 kids prior to there relationship they had boy/boy twins then a single birth then girl/girl twins then a single birth then boy/girl twins & they didnt use fertility drugs or anything & she still with 8 kids still doesn't want to get her tubes tide          Helpful     Nice     Funny     Encouraging     Hugs  (1)            Liz -  posted on 05/24/2010   2,013  3  450   So far as I understand, having multiples already does increase your chance, especally if you have a history of twins or multiples in your family, and then have fraternal twins. Though that isn't always the case.  I have a set of b/g twins who will be two June 8th, and I am pregnant again, this time with a singleton, their little brother due July 13th with a planned c-section.

From what I understand, Identical twins are completely random, so the odds are against you having identical twins again. As much as I love my twins, the thought of having another set scares the you-know-what out of me. Odds are that these ones will be our only children.

I also saw a  news story a year or so ago  about a mixed couple that had 2 sets of twins and each set had one black and one white child. I thought that was pretty neat.  I also know someone who had 2 sets of fraternals 8 years apart.  Anyway, I think it's more common with fraternal twins b/c you drop multiple eggs but I'm not sure (and identicals just happen).
