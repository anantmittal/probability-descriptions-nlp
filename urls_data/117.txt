Before we get to the Funbag, a quick reminder that the next reading for The Postmortal will be at 7 p.m. at Book Court in Brooklyn on Monday. Will Leitch will also be there as a special guest, and we can all tease him about eating raisins and fingerblasting himself to pictures of Ricky Ankiel. So join in the fun if you're around. It'll be hipsterriffic. Now, your letters. Advertisement Chris: So there's this Washington Post story going around about a bat-shit German guy who killed his geezer wife and claims to be an Iraqi general. Thing is, I've SEEN this guy around Georgetown for years — I've walked past him at least a few times. It got me thinking — how many times have I crossed paths with certifiable killers? It has to be a surprisingly high number, right? Advertisement It depends on where you live. If you live somewhere with a high murder rate... SURPRISE! You may have shaken hands with Monster Kody Scott. But if you grew up on the mean streets of Wayzata, Minn., as I did, that number is probably negligible (and I don't count military personnel, I'm talking people who have maliciously killed others). Since the year I was born (1976), there have been roughly 20,000 murders in the US per year, which would make for 680,000 murders over the course of my lifetime. That's a few hundred thousand murderers to potentially stumble across, so I guess you might shake hands with one of two in your travels. I went to school with a murderer. In July, Mr. Ko was convicted of second-degree murder for killing Hyseung Lynda Hong, 26, in her Manhattan apartment in March 1998, slashing her throat in what prosecutors described as an attack intended to impress a jealous girlfriend. I think I might have said hi to him at one point or another. I can't really remember. It's not a terribly comforting thought. Advertisement BJP: One stat breakdown that you never see and (presumably) never will is dick size. Think about it for a minute. As an example, we don't know the breakdown of men with prostate cancer by dick size. Maybe the probability of a person with a 2-inch or smaller dick getting cancer is less than 10% but once you get into the 8-inch or larger category it is 85%. Maybe people with dick sizes between 6 and 8 inches have a higher likelihood of being psychopathic killers than all other sizes. We just don't know but maybe we should! Keeping track of dick size may save lives!! Worth considering, no? Indeed. Doing a sociological study of men by penis size could help destroy certain myths. For example, what if we found out that the majority of Corvette owners have HUGE dicks? Maybe they aren't overcompensating for anything. In fact, maybe they bought a sports car specifically because they have a huge dick but can't say anything about it in polite company? That would destroy conventional wisdom. You could do an entire dickonomic study on whether or not men with big dicks are smarter, better educated, wealthier, or blacker. You could also do a racial breakdown to see if what they say about Asian men having small penises is true (And I bet it is!). You could study mating habits by penis size. You could do a geographical study of penis sizes. What is the most well-endowed city in the US? Is it East St. Louis? I bet it's East St. Louis. Do men with big penises eat more tacos? WHY? It's all in play. Advertisement BJ: Does it bother you at all that after 11am comes 12pm and after 11pm comes 12am? I have always thought this was retarded So then, under your model, 12PM would actually be 12AM, and the PMs wouldn't start until an hour later with 1PM, yes? That does make sense. But if I tried to actually adjust to that, my head would fall off of my body. So the old way remains. Advertisement Jake: Say you were given command of an NFL team. You are allowed to assemble your offense from any players you want in the whole league—even guys already signed by other teams. But because Goodell is a prick, you aren't allowed to have a QB. That includes guys like Brad Smith and Josh Cribbs who have played the position in college. You are still allowed to throw the ball, but obviously that is a very limited option without a QB. You are able to assemble an elite team of tailbacks and run-blockers, but opposing teams are able to prepare for your team without having to worry about the passing game. How many games do you think this team could win? I think you could win four or five games. Advertisement Well, you'd still have a literal QB position, someone to take snaps. It's just that you'd be using a back or a wideout to do the job, which means you'd basically have an All-Pro football team run by an extremely inexperienced but presumably athletic quarterback (the 2002 Steelers, basically). If you had a Top 5 defense on the other side of the ball, you could probably get seven or eight wins out of it, or even more, depending on the schedule, because even bad QBs can make decent plays against shitty defenses (especially with all the rules against hitting the passer now). If Percy Harvin were your QB, you'd have a whole season to get him acclimated to the position permanently, and to install whatever rollouts and simple passes you think suit him best. I'm the kind of person who gets extremely excited whenever a running back or wideout throws the ball, which makes no sense because why should I be excited about someone throwing the ball who clearly isn't as well-suited for it as the QB? I also get really fucking jazzed if a team's QBs all get injured in one game and the specter of using a skill player as an emergency QB becomes a real threat. When that becomes a possibility, I openly root for the last QB standing to get his knee blown to shit. Same with nonpitchers being forced to pitch in games, especially if it's Jose Canseco doing the pitching. Sports novelties are AWESOME. Greg: Hanging up on somebody used to be the equivalent of giving them the finger then disappearing in a cloud of smoke, leaving them alone with their rage and a useless phone in their hand. Nowadays, everyone knows all too well that cell phones - and iPhones in particular - drop calls all the time, so if you angrily hang up on somebody, odds are this person will assume the call got dropped and call you right back, completely missing the message you were trying to convey. The only opportunity for a true old school hang up is when both parties know full well that they are both using landlines - as someone who doesn't have a house phone, that means work calls only, and I don't have nearly the clout required to survive such a move at work. I look forward to the day when we come full circle and all have very reliable satellite phones, leaving no doubt that yes, I just hung up on you. Advertisement Well now, wait a second. I still think you can make it perfectly clear to the other person that you ended the call on purpose. If you ramp up to your hangup with, "You know what? FUCK YOU. This conversation's over, asshole," and then press END, the person on the other line would have to be a real idiot to be like, "Whoa hey! I think he lost reception!" The real crime of cell phones is that you aren't allowed the physical gratification of slamming the phone down. You can't be like, FUCK YOU, and then bash the receiver into the phone base. Now you say FUCK YOU and then thumb around for the end button for two seconds before pressing it angrily, which isn't anywhere near as fun. Ever have a friend who ends calls too abruptly? My best friend does this all the time. We'll be talking and the conversation will end without me prepared for it at all. HIM: So you're gonna be there? ME: Yeah, I'll be there around eight. HIM: Got it. (HANGS UP) Whoa hey, I wasn't ready for that. You have to prepare me for the fact that you're about to hang up. There needs to be a "see ya" or a "good bye." You can't just cut me off like that. I HAVE FEELINGS, JEREMY. Advertisement By the way, I was in the store yesterday and there was a woman in the produce aisle screaming at someone in her phone. Real screaming. Just reaming the shit out of whoever was on the other end of the line. And I shouldn't point out that she was black, but MY GOD SHE WAS REAL BLACK AND REAL LOUD. And she was all like, "No! You are NOT listening to me, no you are NOT!" And I was like, "How could he not be listening to you? The whole fucking world can hear you." And she kept at it for minutes at a time while everyone else just stared and felt awkward and horrible. And I kept wondering why the person on the other end didn't just hang up. Who sticks around for that kind of lambasting? I would have hung up after three seconds. She was already yelling at me at top volume. What was she gonna do, yell more? One other thing: I saw a guy in town today with an iPhone in his pocket and, extending out from the iPhone, a blue old school phone handset, so he's sitting in the middle of town talking on a handset going into his pocket. What a fucking asshat. I hope he got hit by a van. Ted: Carl Monday goes to my gym. I see him there on average once a week. Tuesday was "Shoulders Day" for Cleveland's premier investigative reporter. He also is the type of person that shamelessly fills up an entire water bottle with multiple people and mounting frustration waiting behind him. Each time I see him, I am torn between being nervous or being able to rest assured about my gym choice. On the one hand, I should feel confident because Carl Monday most definitely did his homework on choosing a place that could potentially be swarming with staph infections, steroids, bacchanalia in the men's showers, etc. Furthermore, I would assume management would recognize who he is and the potential embarrassment a douche like him could cause, forcing the club to maintain a high standard. On the other hand, I constantly think that he may be undercover and performing a year plus long investigation into some seedy actions or unsanitary conditions and that I am destined to get a staph infection. Either way, I need to join a new gym, right? Advertisement I think you do. Because what if Carl is always poking around the locker room to see if you're masturbating? What if he set up a camera in the steam room to catch you jacking off even though no one else is around and it's clearly off-peak hours? I wouldn't want some narc like that ruining my good time. The Most Brilliant Thing You&apos;ll See All Day So a local television station in Cleveland decided to put together an "investigative… Read more Read (NOTE: I accidentally left my gym bag in my car all weekend long, with the smelly clothes left to ferment for 48 hours in car heat, which is much worse than regular heat. When I took the bag in this afternoon and smelled it... Oh, man. That was something. Like someone drowned you in ammonia. Highly recommended.) Advertisement HALFTIME! David: Not that I give 2 shits about NASCAR, but I couldn't help but notice that despite losing his driver's license for 45 days, Kyle Busch is still allowed to participate in a Truck Series (?) race during that time. What the fuck? It seems like if you're not allowed to drive on a regular road, you shouldn't be allowed to drive really fast in circles professionally. My question: Is there an actual legal code that allows NASCAR drivers to break the law in controlled environments, or is it just a cultural understanding? And secondly, and more importantly, if you could participate in any recreational activity that, under normal circumstances, would find you afoul of the law, what would it be? Advertisement If you can believe it, a driver's license is NOT required to be a NASCAR driver. I assume this is because NASCAR races take place on a closed course in a controlled environment, and because race cars are completely different vehicles from normal passenger cars, and because the law down South differentiates between "drivin'" and "racin'", with "racin'" falling under the purview of a 12-man committee of moonshiners and immigrant smugglers. But I think it would add a whole lot more spice to NASCAR if drivers who ran afoul of traffic laws were subject to the same license suspensions that you and I had to deal with. I'd love to see NASCAR drivers arrive at the garage to find a Denver boot on the wheel. Or seeing a driver with multiple DUI convictions forced to blow into a government-mandated Breathalyzer device every time he starts a race. Aaron: Do you think the President could acquire a bag of weed if he wanted one? If Obama decided one day that he could really go for a good toke, it would be extremely difficult for him to actually pull it off. Obviously a normal dealer is out of the question, because nobody goes near the president without being frisked by ten secret service agents. He could try to get one of his secret service guys who is actually allowed near him to pick it up, but to get that job, they have to take all kinds of lie detector tests to prove that they have never been tainted by the evils of illegal drugs, so the guy would probably wind up spending 200 of YOUR TAX DOLLARS on a bag of oregano. Advertisement Of course the President can acquire a bag of weed. I know Obama can be lacking in backbone at times, but even he has the pull to get his hands on prime weed if he needs it. He can probably ask a friend with a prescription. He can ask an aide, who would negotiate through a third party without the President's name ever attached. I assume that all you have to do if you're President is to ask and any number of shadowy government forces will set the process into motion. If a President can secretly bomb Laos, then getting weed isn't a problem at all. Same with heroin, coke, whatever. It behooves your Presidential lackeys to please you, lest they find themselves suddenly fired and with a story about their necrophilia habits planted in the Washington Post. Don't think it doesn't happen EVERY DAY in American politics. Patrick: Do you ever wonder whether someone you only sort-of know has based their entire opinion of you on one thing? Like ONE DAY you forgot to brush your teeth and all of a sudden they're like "Oh, you mean Patrick with the bad breath?" This idea terrifies me. Advertisement That's like when you get caught masturbating, as I was caught by my roommate's girlfriend in college. You go from "Hey, that's Drew," to "Hey, that's Drew who masturbates" instantly. AS IF NO ONE ELSE MASTURBATES! So unfair, I tell you! The worst part about it is knowing other people are thinking that about you. I got so paranoid about people talking about me being caught masturbating that I once brought it up to a girl I had been hooking up with who had suddenly stopped hooking up with me (NOTE: If a girl suddenly stops hooking up with you, NEVER go back and ask why). And I was like, "Don't play coy with me! WHAT DID YOU HEAR?" As if that were going to help matters at all. Either she wasn't going to explain, or she was gonna confirm every horrible fear I had about being caught jacking it. Fantastic options right there. God, I hate old me. Tarks Towel: So, I have never understood the idea of a cold shower. If I am left frustrated sexually, wouldn't just a warm shower and jerking yourself while showering be more effective and accomplish the purpose at hand (pun intended)? Advertisement Most definitely. I think when most people say, "I'm gonna need a cold shower," they mean it as a figure of speech. I don't think any guy with blueballs has ever literally been like, "God, I'm so hot and bothered! I better go take a shower in subfreezing temperatures! That'll work way better than masturbating!" That would be idiotic. I've tried doing the cold shower thing on crazy hot summer days, when it sounds like a good idea to take a cold shower but isn't all that fun in practice. I always step in try and convince myself it's refreshing, only to turn the heat up five seconds later. I prefer comfort. Ever have your hot water fail on you before going to work? And you have to stand there just out of the shower's jet spray while you moisten yourself with a damp washcloth and try and at least partially cleanse yourself without freezing to death? There's no quicker way to ruin your week. So cold. So very, very cold. Dominick: Who would win in a fight: a gorilla or a polar bear? Alphas of each species. Also the fight is in a neutral location such as the Mandalay Bay events center so we could gamble on it. And in that case what are the money lines? I've discussed this with my friends for close to a decade and most people seem to think polar bear. Either way I think it would be a great fight. Advertisement Full grown gorillas can lift upwards of a ton, depending upon whom you ask. They can weigh up to 500 pounds. The largest polar bear on record weighed over 2,000 lbs. So the polar bear has an enormous size advantage over the silverback. Polar bears can also run upwards of 25mph, although they shrink like bitches when faced with a little bit of global warming. The silverback would have advantages in terms of dexterity, what with its long arms and opposable thumbs. Do gorillas know how to do a choke hold? Because I could see the silverback jumping on top of the bear and choking the bear to death. But I think size would win out and the bear would eventually prevail. I assume Vegas oddsmakers would make the bear a favorite. Then I'd expect Simmons to bitch about that line being too high and declare, "Vegas clearly has no idea what to make of this matchup." Larry: How many pounds of deli meat do you think you could eat in a single sitting? We get a pound and a half of ham from the store every Monday. And the deli guy always does a double take when I say a pound and a half, as if it was some kind of mistake. No, motherfucker. I didn't say half a pound. I said 1.5 pounds. GIMME GIMME GIMME. Then they slice it and it makes a huge tower on the scale and I have to hold myself back to not dive into the tower and begin making sweet love to the stack. And when we get it home I always eat about two-thirds of it right out of the bag immediately. Nothing can quench my insatiable ham lust. It's so good right when it's been freshly sliced. So salty. So hammy. I take a wad and stuff it in my foodhole like it's Red Man. It's a repulsive thing to behold. I could easily eat the whole bag in one sitting. Beyond that, I'd probably die of nitrate poisoning. Advertisement Our store has a deli kiosk, where you can order your shit on a touch screen and then come back after you've gotten all your other crap and your deli meat is waiting for you. When it works, this is the greatest thing ever. I just stroll on up past the old ladies, grab my meat, fart, and peel out of there. It feels incredible. But other times, the kiosk is broken, or the fuckhead deli guy never bothered to check the ticker tape printout. HAM FOUL. And the touch screen only includes slicing preferences for certain meats. If you order bologna, it asks you if you want THICK, MEDIUM, or THIN (there should be a SHAVE IT LIKE A PENTHOUSE VAGINA option, but I digress). But it doesn't offer the same options for ham, which means the fate of my meat is left in the hands of the slicer, who is always too lazy to go to thin slicing and always hands you back a pound of ham in three slices. Ever have your deli meat go bad after three days in the fridge, when it gets all slimy? I eat it anyway. No shame. Anon: How long do you think it takes to film the average porn scene, (25-30 minutes)? I know the guys juice up with Viagra, etc. but I figure they can't pound away on some chick's ass for 30 minutes without blowing a wad. Advertisement I don't think it takes very long, because most every porn movie is shot on a low budget, so the emphasis is on getting to the money shot and moving on with your shooting day. Unless you're talking about an Andrew Blake movie. I assume it takes Andrew Blake 5 hours just to light one vagina properly. The man is an artist. Otherwise, I think 30 minutes to an hour would be about right. You have to set up the light, position the camera, get the actors in place, get them doing it, then change angles as appropriate (almost always to a tight angle, which makes no sense to me. I'd happily splurge on any DVD collection of wide-angle only porn). Also, everyone is probably on cocaine during the shooting, so things move fast, even if all porn scenes always go on too long. Nate: Given enough time in a coma, your muscles will atrophy. This includes your arms, legs, etc. What about the muscles needed to ejaculate? Say you wake up from a coma and A.) you physically can't rub one out because you can't move your arms, B.) even if you can move your arms, you can't ejaculate. I know the first thing I would want to do after a 15 year coma would be to wank. Maybe as part of physical therapy someone gives you a tugjob? Advertisement Well, the muscle that controls ejaculation would probably still work because I assume those muscles are involuntary and would continue to function while you were in a coma. You'd still pee while in a coma. You could still have wet dreams (oooh coma wet dream). You heart would still beat. Certain muscles would continue to be used. Your arms and legs are different because you consciously control them, so they would atrophy. So you could conceivably wake up able to ejaculate but perhaps too weak for a full on jerking session, in which case I assume you'd work up the strength to either use your arm or hump the rolling metal stand that carries your IV. Either way, that would be one big load. Email of the week time. Salmendav: Am I the only one who hoards conversational nuggets? Let's say I have to hang out with my sister's new boyfriend who I know isn't into sports, or probably anything socially acceptable for that matter. I do possess however, the exciting knowledge that he has recently been to Florida. So the first awkward silence that comes along I tell myself, 'Easy cowpoke, let's save the big guns for a longer, more awkward silence'. And instead say 'I see you are wearing Wranglers, I like a man of substance and style'. Which means I will be asking about Florida in ten awkward seconds. Advertisement Good nuggets. LOFTY nuggets.

Leo Qin  Data Science and Funny Math         Home  Blog  Contact  Resume                         How Many Murderers Will You Walk Past?      Note: the below is an exercise in Fermi estimation , which is a great way of making accurate, if not precise, estimates based on very little data.  Yesterday, as I was browsing Facebook, I saw a picture stating that “The average person walks past a murder 36 times in their life.” Surely, this is an extraordinary claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If there’s one thing that clickbait pictures from 9gag do not contain, it’s extraordinary evidence. So, let’s test their claim. How many murderers will an average person walk past in their life?   First, let’s unpack that question:   The scope of the question is murderers (let’s assume unique murderers, so if one of your coworkers were a murderer you would only count them once no matter how times you interacted)  The scale of the question is average people, which means that we can use aggregated data and only have to worry about the population described in aggregate  Walk past implies a very low level of interaction, but is inclusive of higher levels. That lady at the grocery store with whom you were competing for the last jar of your favorite peanut butter counts, but so does your mom.  In their life indicates that the question is not iterative, and is limited only to the time frame in which the observer is alive.   Great, now let’s set some assumptions and examine if they are reasonable:   You live in the United States – our crime rate is rather high, which may be a function of reporting, but the rate for murders is actually below the average for the world (but still higher than Europe, Asia, and Oceania). North and South America actually have the highest intentional homicide rate in the world. Let’s keep it simple.  You can only walk past a murderer on the street if they got away with murder – Popular TV shows say that once two days has elapsed since the murder, it is unlikely to the solved. In reality, the truth is unlikely to be that easy, but there’s also very little data on the topic otherwise. We may have to give this one a pass.  The average murderer only kills one person – Dr. Mike Aamodt at Radford University has compiled a dataset on the basic statistics of serial killers . It contains data on 3873 serial killers and 11,187 victims, or approximately 2.89 victims per serial killer. Such a low number brings into question the definition of serial killer, but it also tells us that this is a safe assumption.  The average person walks past some number of people every day. This number is vague and contentious, so we’ll deal with it later.   And finally, let’s get our basic facts in order:   The average lifespan in the US is 78.74 years  The rate of murders in the US in 2013 was 4.5 murders per 100,000 people, or 14,196 estimated in total  The population of the US in 2014 was estimated at 322,583,006 people  One third of murders go unsolved   This is a stock photo, I swear.  Out of 78.74 years, let’s say that the average person is ambulatory and social for 75 of them. That’s 75 years, or 27,375 days (not counting leap years) during which you might walk past a murderer.  One third of murders go unsolved, so 1.5 murders per 100,000 people go unsolved. Extending on the basis of our third assumption, that means that the rate of unapprehended murderer in the US is 1.5 per 100,000 people, or 4838 at any given time. That is 0.0015% of the population.  That just leaves the fourth assumption: how many people does one walk past every day? This depends to some degree on lifestyle. If you’re a trucker that only works night shifts, you probably have many-fold fewer interactions than does someone who works at an airport or a carnival, to give two examples. In any case, this number is contentious, so we’ll test it two different ways.  First, let’s try out a logarithmic scale distribution. Just from the previous example, it’s clear to me that some people have a lot more interactions than others. Let’s test the resultant range when we test a range that varies in a logarithmic fashion. If you meet 1 new person per day, you meet 27,375 new people throughout your entire life, of which 0.41 of them are likely to be unapprehended murderers. Of course, this means that if you meet 10 new people per day, you’ve met 4.1 murderers throughout your life, and if you meet 100 people new people per day, then you’ve met 41 murders throughout your life.  This is a very interesting result because it is actually quite close to what the picture told us. If you live in or around a city and walk somewhat frequently, it’s very conceivable that you could meet 100 new people per day. Of course, if you live in a small town, or in a city but you do not walk around a lot, 100 is less likely to be achievable. The power of the logarithmic scale is that you get a wide and diverse range without a lot of work.   Let’s try another approach to finding this number. I know that most people meet an average number of people per day, but that some meet an unusually large or small amount. Using a normal distribution, we can compute a “typical” number that the aggregated average of people might meet. Let’s pull forward the values from the logarithmic distribution and assign a quintile (or 20%) each for 1 and 100 new people per day, and the remaining three quintiles for 10 new people per day.  By calculating the distributed average, we find that (20% * 1) + (20% * 100) + (60% * 10) =  26.2 new people per day. This seems reasonable, so let’s finish the calculation.  At 26.2 new people per day, the average American meets 717,225 people throughout their lives, of which 10.76 are likely to be unapprehended murderers. Not bad. 9Gag calls their fact a fun fact because they didn’t kill you… but 10.76 murderers over 75 years really just means that they (and you) are so busy meeting people that any specific person is unlikely to be one of their victims.  Well, that was dark.            crime fermi fermi estimation logarithms math murder normal distribution              16 Responses to “ How Many Murderers Will You Walk Past? ”           Roccito  2 years ago    Reply    But people get out of prison after murdering, so the number would be much higher.

Wow what a very interesting stat and thing to read! One doesn’t usually know three killers in their lifetime.

If interested in speaking on this topic with me, you can reach me at chasercasting@gmail.com  Thanks!  Chase Jeffery            Robert Y.  1 year ago    Reply    I agree with Roccito. You assume they had to get away with murder in order for you to have walked past them. But the prison system is always letting prisoners out, and that includes murderers. Plus, it doesn’t say specifically that they had already murdered someone. It just states that you will walk past that many in a life time. Does this not also include people who will eventually commit murder as well as those who already have? Or does that make the number even larger?          C  9 months ago    Reply    NBC did a study and they estimate that 6,000 people a year get away with murder. That’s not 6,000 murders that is not one person getting away with more than one murder. That is 6,000 people getting away with murder and possibly more than one murder a year. 6,000 people a year get away with murder. In their estimation. That is a lot of people. And those are only the ones that get away with it. And are never charged or even looked at.          Galen Irby  1 month ago    Reply    It seems that Since most murderers only murder one person, we don’t have to worry about the murderers we pass because they’ve already met their quota. It’s everyone else that is a potential murderer that is disconcerting.          Jon  1 month ago    Reply    Well, these stats are waaayyyy off according to my own experiences. I don’t live in a city. I rarely meet many new people, but i personally know of 17 different people who got away with murder and were never suspected. Now, there was one group of 3 involved in 1 murder, and another group of 4 involved in another. There was 1 couple. But still, it just proves that many unsolved murders are never a statistic in any way. Some were passed off as OD’s, some as suicide, 1 passed off as a drowning, one a diabetic sugar crash, and 1 as “self defense.” In all cases, it just took a little planning, and BOOM, they’re dead, and the murderer(s) got away clean. So yea, no one could possibly know how many murders there really are. But it’s definitely A LOT higher than any of these “sources” could ever suspect.          Inez Mond  2 weeks ago    Reply    There’s a flaw in your math. You said that 4.5 people per 100,000 were murdered every year, divided by 3 to get 1.5 people per 100,000 who get away with murder each year . Every year of their lives afterward (that they aren’t in prison for another crime), they’re walking around adding to the total percent of murders in the population. Violent offending peaks in the late teens and early twenties, and like you say, the average US life expectancy is in the mid-seventies, so on average most of the people who got away with murder in the last 50 years are going to be alive. Let’s adjust that downward to 40 years to reflect the fact that people with a history of violent crime (shockingly) have a shorter life expectancy than average. Assuming they each committed exactly one murder, that would give us .0015% * 40 = 0.06%, or about 1 in 1667 people. The estimate should probably be a bit more conservative, because some people do commit multiple murders and others will end up in jail later for unrelated charges, so my best estimate would be that 1 in 2000 of your fellow community members is a successful murderer.  Plugging that 0.05% estimate into your formula with your estimate for the average number of people Americans meet each day, you get P(not a murderer) = .9995^26.2 = a 98.7% chance you didn’t walk past a murderer on any given day. At that rate, it will only take about 53 days before you passed your first murderer.

Why do most serial killers have above average intelligence? What do you call someone who has killed a killer who has killed several killers who were serial killing serial killers killing serial killers? Ask New Question   Steven Cook Answered Dec 10, 2017 · Author has 612 answers and 396.7k answer views Lets try to put this number into perspective shall we. We should start by looking at the number of unsolved homicides in our local areas. You might be shocked to see just how many homicides go unsolved and the murderers are still at large. Look at the number of unsolved homicides and compare that to the local population. Math is not my strongest subject but that’s what the math would look like. I live in the State of Nevada and based on the numbers I was able to find there were 40 unsolved homicides in the year of 2016 alone. So that means there are up to 40 murderers still at large. Some of these cases may be linked to serial a serial killer. Nevada currently has a estimated population of about 2.94 million people, most Nevada residences live in Washoe County and Clark County. Nevada is also a hot spot for tourism we get around about number of 50 million people who visit Nevada every year. So it’s very possible that the murderers may have fled the state and went back home. So yes, it is totally possible to walk past a murderer on the streets and you would never know it. I’ve also been very interested in statistics like these. How many women do you walk by everyday who are struggling with drug addiction. These days you could be sitting on the bus next to a prostitute and you would never know it. They look just like everyone else. They no longer dress in skimpy clothes anymore unless they’re working at a brothel or a strip club. I live in the state of Nevada where these activities are legal, So it’s interesting to me to think about these numbers. it helps pass the time when you’re board. how many drug dealers to walk past when you’re at the airport. How many human trafficking victims do you walk past at the airport. It’s nearly impossible to know for the average individual. But when you look at the reported statistics it can help give you a better understanding. There is a estimated 20 to 30 million adults who are victims of human trafficking. These numbers are mind blowing because most people would never think about it when they’re stuck at a airport lounge or waiting in line at a greyhound bus station. 3.9k Views · View Upvoters   William Formby , PhD Criminal Justice & Higher Education, The University of Alabama (1981) Answered Mar 12, 2018 · Author has 1.4k answers and 1m answer views That of course depends on the indiidual.

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Paul Dezso deHolczer , I am a practicing attorney. Updated Jul 8, 2015 · Author has 2.1k answers and 1.7m answer views Assuming that this question addresses attorneys in the USA, the author of this question and its details has many misconceptions about what a defense attorney does and what is required of him or her.  These misconceptions are common and not a sign that the questioner is stupid or particularly ignorant. If a person is convicted of murder, his or her life is over. Why do lawyer need to be part of this?  Defense attorneys defend clients.  That is their job. Every accused person is presumed innocent until and unless one of two things happen: 1) a judge or jury finds that person is guilty after a trial; or, 2) the defendant knowingly and willingly waives the right to make the prosecutor prove guilt and informs the court that he or she is guilty of the crime with which he or she is charged. The prosecutor has the burden of proving a defendant is guilty.  That means that the prosecutor must prove the defendant is guilty in a court of law if the defendant determines to have a trial.  A defendant does not have the obligation of proving he or she is innocent of the charges.  The courts have even conceded that it is sometimes impossible for a person to prove that he or she is innocent. The defense attorney, on behalf of the defendant, has the right and the duty to make the prosecutor do a thorough job proving guilt. Let say if a lawyer give false evidence and things like that to get their clients out of the murder charge, is that unethical? This is absolutely unethical and forbidden. The lawyer can be punished for this both professionally and criminally. The defense attorney cannot ask or invite people ( even the defendant! ) to lie or misrepresent.  The defense attorney cannot ask or invite people ( except for the defendant! ) to withhold information from the prosecutor. [Does this] mean lawyers who handles murder cases are bad people? Absolutely not. There are and always will be some lawyers who are unethical. There are and always will be some people of whatever profession or occupation you care to name who are unethical. Incidentally, lawyers are citizens of their country and their communities. They have an interest not to see a murderer go free because that murderer could kill one of their friends or family.  Lawyers have to put those fears and concerns aside and do their best for the client.  That is their ethical obligation.  Being the attorney for an allegedly violent defendant does not shield an attorney from a violent act which might be committed by that allegedly violent defendant.  Historically, allegedly violent defendants have attacked and even killed their own defense attorneys.  One who represents an allegedly violent defendant to the best of his or her ability serves the public by fulfilling his or her obligations under our adversarial system. If the evidence is strong against a particular defendant, an attorney takes the case simply to save the defendant from capital punishment. 6.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

What happens if I tell my lawyer I killed someone and he tells the police? Ask New Question   Jennifer Ellis , I'm a lawyer in PA, USA. Nothing I write is legal advice. Updated Jul 20, 2015 · Author has 12.9k answers and 42.2m answer views As Paul Dezso deHolczer writes, the asker has some serious misconceptions about how the US legal system works, if that is the system he is asking about. First, you are assuming that there are no chances to fight or reduce the charge. If you are charged with first degree murder, in many states, you could be put to death. As a result, a lawyer could literally save your life. Or, could stop you from spending the rest of your life in prison. Second, a lawyer is necessary because our legal system requires two lawyers. One to represent the state and do all he can, within ethical bounds, to convict the accused; and one to do all he can, within ethical bounds, to help his client be found not guilty or to get his client the best deal possible. While I am sure there are lawyers who present false evidence, such lawyers are engaging in unethical behavior and could be disbarred for doing so. If a lawyer knows anyone will lie on the stand, even his client, he cannot put that person on the stand. If the client continues to insist on testifying, the lawyer will have to withdraw from the case. Many people think lawyers are unethical, but the truth is quite different. We are very ethical. We have to be. What lawyers do is work with the facts and witnesses they have. Laypeople often think cases are open and shut, but rarely is this the fact. As a result, laypeople think someone must have lied or done something wrong when someone they are convinced is guilty is found not guilty or is found guilty of a lesser crime. In the US, the prosecutor must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a very high standard to meet. And it is the job of the defense attorney to introduce reasonable doubt. He may do so by convincing the jury that witnesses made mistakes or are not credible. Or that there are other problems with the prosecution's case. There are often different views on what happened. All of this is relevant in terms of whether the accused will be convicted and if so, what he will be convicted of. Lawyers who handle criminal cases, even murder cases, are not bad people. I know many such attorneys and they are fine, upstanding people who care that the legal system is kept in check and that people have the constitutional protections to which they are entitled. Both innocent and guilty people are accorded these same rights in the US. 17.9k Views · View Upvoters If you require legal assistance, please contact a lawyer in yo...

Undo   Robert Jones Answered May 15, 2017 · Author has 65 answers and 17.9k answer views How can you already know someone is a murderer, without the proof? There are so many fallacies here… all up and down this page. Especially concerning “ethics”, such as Jennifer Ellis’ answer. I know there is something called a “legal ethics attorney”, but it’s strange, because they’re operating on something non-existent. It’s similar to “Constitutional Law”. Constitutional Law doesn’t really exist on an objective level. It exists, according to the interpretation of those who attempt to practice it. But these people have their own biases and beliefs, that don’t necessarily fit into the puzzle of objective complexity. Same goes for “knowing their clients are murderers”. How do they know, without evidence? That’s a far-fetched assumption. ———————————————————————————————————————- As an addon bonus, Jennifer Ellis asks what I do for a living so she can insult it…. Because I suppose she assumed my comment was an insult to her—which it was not. I was stating my opinion, and backing it up with a known fact; albeit, a fact not many are willing to subscribe to… But nevertheless, a fact. And her insults—along with anyone else’s—is more than welcome. I encourage criticism.. That’s how I learn. But this is how everyone learns. I’m not some alien, because I prefer constructive criticism and debating people with different opinions. But, she won’t allow me to comment back, even though she makes it seem as if she encourages it herself. In other words, she blocked me. So this is an appeal to the masses that makes it look as if I was shut down… But I am not shut down.. Here I am. WOW! And she blocked me because she didn’t feel like defending her bogus argument. But this is nothing new on Quora—or elsewhere—for that matter. I’m an autodidact of epistemology. I study, not exactly the objective truth, but the pursuit of objective truth. I study the methodologies of both knowing how to know, and knowing how to detect manipulations of fallacies, to which people claim to know. The latter is something I consider sophistry. The former, a complex, bottomless pit, that no doubt, isolates me from most people because I am not concerned with the social in-group biases of the mainstream herd. I don’t care what is/ what is not acceptable. I care about the truth… And on this mission, the truth is only available by a select, few instructions, to get there. And this runs back to the premise of this question. One can have an “instinct” or even an “intuition”, but this is a subjective analysis based on only the evidence you’re already familiar with. It’s a feedback loop of cognitive functioning that acts much like the “backfire effect”, in that you’ll want to believe what you already feel to be true, before actively getting out of the comfort zone to interrogate your beliefs, to a proportional degree as that which you claim to be true. 493 Views Quora User , Aspiring Lawyer Answered Nov 15, 2016 First off, I would like to point out that there is no situation where there is no chance to reduce the charge, because, for that to happen, he would have to be guilty before proven innocent , which is not the case. Yes lawyers, especially those in criminal defense, take cases in crimes in which they know that their client is guilty. This is not because they are heartless monsters that can't see reason like the rest of us, but because the constitution expressly states that everyone has the right to legal representation. Also, to answer your question about those lawyers being bad people, I could counter by saying that they are better people than any of us because while we condemn people as murderers without the facts, they seek the truth. 2k Views · View Upvoters   Justin Baker Answered Aug 20, 2016 Yes, attorneys who choose to defend people who are clearly guilty are absolutely bad people and deserve the same penalties the murderers they defend deserve, death. People are the absolute lowest of scum, other than the scum they willingly defend. I understand that people are presumed innocent until found guilty. But there are plenty of cases where it is known EXACTLY what happened and that the person is 100% guilty of a heinous and unforgivable crime. Jennifer and Paul both know this, but they couch there answers in legal and ethics BS to make themselves feel better, otherwise how would they sleep at night. They attempt to help rapists and murderers go free so they can hurt more people. No good human being can do that, regardless of what the “law” says the process should be. Ultimately it’s just extremely disgusting that there are people like Jennifer and Paul who actually think there is a justification for what they do. I guarantee they’ve never had to be face to face with the families of the victims of the scumbags they defend. Or maybe they have and just don’t care, which is another point that shows they are bad people. There is no excuse for what they do and good people like us can only hope that they will someday be put in prison the same as the criminals they defend, or that they eventually develop some actual human compassion and guilt and do the right thing by taking their own lives to atone for all the evil people they’ve defended and the terrible things they’ve allowed to continue happening. We can also hope that someday they or their families are victims of a terrible crime so that they can be on the other side and understand why us “ignorant and stupid” (Paul’s words) regular people, see them for the horrible, disgusting, bad people that they are. 1.2k Views · View Upvoters   Ken Dunham , Lawyer (Ottawa, Canada) Answered Nov 2, 2017 · Author has 1.9k answers and 448.7k answer views In many cases, we don’t k now that a person is guilty as charged until the evidence against them has been tested in court through the process of a fair trial. Part of the defence lawyer’s job is to ensure the accused gets a fair trial. The prosecution’s case is often not what everyone may assume it to be prior to the trial. Witnesses have yet to be tested through cross-examination. The defence has yet to present their evidence and arguments. The defence lawyer often doesn’t know what really happened. S/he wasn’t there. The accused may have a very different story to tell than the version being offered by the police / prosecution. Testimony from witnesses is often very different than that suggested by summaries in police reports. There are certainly cases where the evidence against the accused is overwhelming. But it’s still essential that we have a fair trial if the accused exercises his / her constitutional right to a trial. It’s not in anyone’s interest to convict people without a fair trial. Lawyers are prohibited (for legal and moral reasons) not to lead evidence that they know is false. For example, if an accused has already admitted to their lawyer that they were present at the scene of the crime, it would be improper for the lawyer to then call an alibi witness. As with any profession, some lawyers may act unethically on occasion, but most would tell the client that they’re not going to have anything to do with false evidence, and if the client persisted the lawyer would withdraw. A police officer once complained to me about the waste of time and money that is spent on trials for those who are “obviously guilty”. I asked him who decides who is already “obviously” guilty? In his world, that should be the job of the police. Take a moment to ponder the implications of the police deciding who gets a trial or not… 568 Views   Van Hayhow , Adjunct Faculty Member at New England Institute of Technology Answered Mar 9, 2018 · Author has 402 answers and 34k answer views I only write about US law, so please keep that in mind. That said, there are so many misconceptions in this short question it is mind boggling. First, how do we know that our client is a murderer? Because the police say so, the prosecutor says so? Since they are also human I think it is obvious that they can be wrong. Also, many prosecutors (not all) have a habit of knowing over charging so they can plea bargain down to the charge they think is really appropriate. I think this is unethical and many prosecutors agree as they don't do this. Let’s say we agree it is a homicide. Does that make it murder 1, murder 2, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter? Or maybe it is self-defense. I never handled a murder case, but I handled hundreds of criminal cases and there were many where I did not agree with the charge. And your idea that defending someone is somehow misleading the court is outright delusional. 56 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions How are divorce attorneys bad for a client?

And if you're a smoker, don't smoke near the body at all, your saliva can lead back to you, and then dig up a hole and put the burnt body inside the hole and the rest of your work will done by microorganisms. PRE-KILL Above was all easy, but before killing comes the stalking part. You got to record every minor detail about your target, i.e., their routine and it should cover all the details but do it from such a distance that your target remains clueless about you, sometimes you have to even care about their relatives and neighbors so none of them ever suspects you. And i think you should also get yourself informed about attack on which body part causes instant death or somethings like that. These points are all very hectic, thats why they say no murder is perfect, you will make mistake at some place P.S I'm not recommending anybody to kill someone, I'm totally against it and everyone should be. 33k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Vivek Shetti   Andrew Tinker Answered Feb 28, 2018 · Author has 1.1k answers and 418.9k answer views Originally Answered: How do you kill a person and not get caught? 1: You never talk about it with anyone, ever. Especially not somewhere where you have no control over who sees it, like an internet forum. By the way, Quora’s anonymous is pretty good. It’s not perfect. Did you invite anyone to answer this? If so, you aren’t anonymous. Even if you didn’t, it’s probably not police or three letter agency grade anonymous. 2: You make sure your victim isn’t anyone you’re connected to in any way. If the person you kill is anyone you’d have a reason to kill or to want dead, you’ll be a suspect. I know you’ve broken rule 1. Most likely you’re planning to break rule 2 as well. Most people need a motivation to kill, and that motivation is a big arrow pointing right at them. So, the answer to ‘how do YOU kill a person and not get caught?’ is ‘YOU don’t, because you’ve already ensured that you’ll get caught’. 3k Views · View Upvoters   Troy Hoffman , Software Test Automation Engineer (1997-present) Answered Apr 4, 2018 · Author has 652 answers and 318.5k answer views What is the most efficient way to kill someone and not get caught?

Natural poisons are hard to trace. Hemlock or ricin would be almost impossible to trace unless they DNA sourced the plant to your back yard or someplace you left evidence. But if you had any interaction with the person, you would more than likely get caught. Your coworkers or friends or friends of friends would throw you under the bus or make up some story about you hating that particular person and make you a suspect. The perfect murder would be untraceable to you, meaning you couldn’t know the person. would be a complete stranger. There really isn’t a point to you murdering somebody at that rate. I can cause all kinds of problems legally for somebody without resorting to murder. 4.1k Views · View Upvoters   Mauser Entertainment Answered May 26, 2017 Originally Answered: What is the smartest way to kill someone without getting caught? Good question, I've been thinking about this a lot…. lol not because Ive been planning anything. The best way to do it, is actually very simple. (Hard, if you can't bring yourself to kill anyone). You want to choke/ break their neck. MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE there are no witnesses. And ABSOLUTELY do not bring anything that can be tracked. if you bring you phone or computer, you can easily be traced. However, they wouldn't think to trace you if you weren't connected to the victim. If you are a suspect, make sure you have a solid alibi. Put the body in a bag put it in your trunk. Burn the body to ashes, dump the ashes in a river. They will never find the body, so they aren't 100% sure it's a murder. the only way they could be 100% is if they catch your identit. Ways to conceal your identit include wearing gloves a mask (fingerprints, hair, and facial recognition). full body clothing (if they don't know the race, that's more of a variety of suspects). Smooth down the bottom of your boots (you don't have to). Do it at 3 am when no one is watching. The car, switch license plate just in case someone is looking. And please for the love of god, drive the best you ever have in your life, if you do get pulled over don't do anything that will give him reason to search your vehicle. Remain calm cooperate completely. Soo…. yeah when burning the body just dowse them in gasoline by a river that has a population of zero within at least a five mile radius. Then chuck it in the water. Good luck  Although I wouldn't suggest killing anyone. It's simply not worth it.

If more than 1 person knows....odds are that you will get caught. If you knew the person, odds are you will get caught. If you hire someone, 2 people know, you may get caught. If you do it yourself, you leave behind physical evidence in many cases and you get caught. It's never ever worth it.

Next, finish the job in a way that they can't get you caught, like puncturing a lung, so they can't scream. Use a weapon that you can either take with you, or that can take care of itself. Next, try you best to not be driven to insanity. Most murderers who get caught turn themselves in, even if the police would never have found them otherwise. Finally, hide the body. One of the most efficient ways is to freeze it, shatter it, and either bury it or send it into a river that flows to sea. If you follow this list, you can get away with murder easily. 27.8k Views · View Upvoters Anonymous Answered Aug 30, 2017 There's numerous ways, depending how up close you want to be. Distance: car bomb. A pipe bomb is easy to make and doesn't require any hard to source parts. Pay cash or use bogus paypal account. Get sent to drop address. Instructions readily available online. Up close: knife, sever the femoral artery. The person bleeds out in minutes. Change of clothes a necessary precaution. Can approach from behind or face on. Requires practice and confidence, plus rudimentary knowledge of anatomy. Up close: road ‘accident.’ Steal a car or van; if car aim for one with bull bars for maximum damage. Leave overnight in secure parking space. Same night steal matching vehicle plates. Next day hit-and-run victim at speed. Don't stop. Torch vehicle. The most preferable would be the last. You can disguise yourself with hat, glasses etc. Given the suddenness it’s unlikeky anyone would react, or even get a good description or be able to challenge. The death will probably be written off as accidental hit-and-run. If not, there's nothing linking you to the crime anyway. 7.8k Views · View Upvoters   Jennifer Page Answered Apr 12, 2017 Originally Answered: What is the smartest way to kill someone without getting caught? This reminds me of something I read in a book a long time ago (I forgot what the book was called). But anyways, in the book a man was trying to kill a sleeping person in his house. The sleeping man was allergic to bees, wasps, etc., so the murderer opened a nearby window to the house to let a wasp in, and the wasp stung the sleeping man and killed him. When the police arrived to the scene, they said that no one murdered him and he died by a allergic reaction to a wasp sting, so the man didn't get caught. This is one way to kill someone who is allergic to bees. 6.6k Views · View Upvoters Anonymous Answered Aug 31, 2016 Well first of all you’ll have to do a lot of planning, if something goes wrong then have a backup plan. Second of all, DO NOT TELL ANYONE, don’t say that you’re thinking about it or stuff like that. If you want to have a partner in crime, make sure you can trust them, chances are that they’ll kill you after the deed has been done, orrr tell the police. Seriously though, make sure you plan it out, don’t be that one guy who screws everything up just because he’s been sitting there on his laptop for 5 minutes. Don’t post anything online about it before or after…duh. Make sure to remove allllll evidence. Maybe don’t kill the person in their house, maybe in a dark alley or somewhere isolated, you don’t want more people to kill. I’m not trying to encourage you to kill or anything, but if you want then make that decision yourself. I will say it again DO NOT TELL ANYONE. Seriously think this through, if you’re caught, it’s not my fault, just yours for not having every possible scenario thought out.

Don't get seen at the scene of the crime- be aware of cameras. Don't leave evidence at the scene. No cigarette butts, no articles of clothing, don't accidentally drop your wallet containing your driver's license. Don't keep evidence on you… destroy articles of clothing, wash away any blood, dispose of murder weapon. If you have a strong motive that would lead police to suspect you, try to have an alibi or at least a story that can't be disproved through independent investigation- don't say that you were at a bar then have the police look through said bar's security camera footage and be able to prove that you weren't there. Don't tell anyone about, not years down the line…. This is all hypothetical, of course.

You know what, The Mayo Clinic actually made this insinuation during one of my visits. It was during one of the many “leading” conversations that we had. The mere mention of “murder” gave me a serious amount of pause. The nurse working the scene was named Pat, from the East Coast, no doubt put up to the task to get me to “confess” that I’m some sort of murderer. She used the guise of menopause and stated that she felt like killing someone when she was going through menopause. I thought at the time, that’s your fucked up issue, why the fuck are you telling me something so fucking awefull. I WILL NOT CONFESS TO MURDEROUS THOUGHTS BECAUSE I’VE NEVER HAD THEM. The more that you press to make me out to be someone that I’m not the more you dig your own hole. Keep going I dare you. Afterthought: what triggered my written response here is that it was mentioned about “not getting caught”. Fuck you for thinking that I’m some sort of murderer instead of LOOKING at you own. I’m warning you. I will press charges before you make me out to be someone who I’m not. You little people have no idea what the pied piper is capable of and I don’t mean me. I mean THE PHYSICIANS. Surgeons are statistically psychopaths, and that’s what you don’t realize. It’s one of your own, and not the patient. He’s good in the machavilian sense. He knows that I’m onto him, he knew it during my last visit and I haven’t seen him since. That’s exactly when the shit hit the fan. That’s when he threatened me and maltreatment followed. You can either leave it alone or I will take it all the way. Just so that’s not misconstrued- I mean legally. I will win hands down. I promise you. Look at my entry about failure and you’ll know where I stand. Again I dare you. I don’t even care how much money you have.

Honestly, forget about it.

Murder Statistics By far about 8% of murderers have killed over 2/3rds of those known murdered in those cases that the perpetrator was caught. In other words most murderers have only have been known to have killed one person. And in truth there are a lot of murders never discovered by either the 1 time killer or the multiple murderer. In Stockholm alone at least 15% of 'runaways' are never knowingly seen again. My thinking is the vast majority are in a disposal site where they are unlikely ever to be discovered again. In war, even with intensive training and propaganda less than 26% of riflemen even fire at an enemy. 2% of infantryman kill or wound 95% of bullet caused causalities. By far the unseeing bomber and artilleryman have far higher kill rates per person involved. And I have been unable to find a reliable source for that, but that is what infantrymen think (know). 19.4k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

That amounted to only about 3% of the world population at the time. That number was replaced and more within 2 or 3 years after the war. In states where records are kept, the percentage of people who are licensed to carry a concealed gun are only 20% as likely at the general population to murder someone. But if you break out the number of actual criminals from the general population, the general population’s murder rate drops nearly to that of the gun-carrying population.

"It still freaks me out to this day remembering working in labs, and having class discussions with that guy.  "We were definitely not friends but, I probably saw him nearly every day for at least a couple years. I can still see him working across from me under a fume hood in my minds eye anytime his name is brought up."    He never seemed to make eye contact with anyone    A Reddit user recalls going to college with James Holmes    The comments in response to her post are just as interesting - and contain similarly personal links to the tragedy.  One Redditor says: "One of my classmates was shot in the head at that shooting. It's interesting to hear from someone who knew him before that time."  To which the original poster adds: "The only other thing that I remember was that he never seemed to make eye contact with anyone. Totally thought that was just an introvert thing, but still odd."  And others have comparable links to some of the world's most notorious criminals - including Ted Bundy , the prolific serial killer who confessed to murdering at least 30 young women in the 1970s, including 12-year-old Kimberly Leach.  Ted Bundy's 12 year old victim Kimberly Leach  "Ted Bundy dated my aunt," one person writes, astonishingly. "I grew up in Kirkland, Washington - which is right outside of Seattle. My aunt lived in Ballard at the time.  "They dated for a few months and it just sort of fell apart. She said that he was one of the most polite, nicest people that she had ever met."  The author's post prompts an outpouring of anecdotes.  "When Ted Bundy was in prison (in Florida, I think?) his favorite reporter to speak with was my cousin," one writes. "She still has the Christmas card he sent her one year."  But, the user adds: "They had a falling out while he was on death row, and I think he sent her death threats."  Bundy's case, which was documented in an eponymous film directed and co-written by Matthew Bright in 2002, is not the only one of its kind to have been immortalised on screen in recent years.  One Redditor describes being deployed with former US Marine Eddie Ray Routh - subject of the film 'American Sniper'.  He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole in February for shooting and killing soldier Chris Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, at a Texas gun range in 2013.  Lawyers for Eddie Ray Routh have said he was insane and is not guilty of murder  "I deployed with Eddie Ray Routh, who later went on to kill Chris Kyle (AKA American Sniper)," he writes.  "The talk about him made me abundantly aware of the fact that all veterans have a tough time getting help with their mental health after we come back.  "Combat veterans face social pressure to "man up," but noncombat veterans get that plus accusations that they're lying because people think only combat can cause PTSD."  The soldier, while not excusing what Routh did, goes on to describe the kind of trauma experienced by veterans in places like Haiti, to which end, he says, he "still can't eat mango without running the risk of uncontrollably sobbing because the taste instantly reminds me of what it was like". Routh, he claims, was there with him.  "One bite, and I feel the humidity," he writes evocatively. "I smell the burning garbage and the pig s**t from the two feral pigs that we accidentally fenced into our camp.  "I see refugee camps with people living in tents made of their own clothes, holding signs that say "America Help".  "I'm THERE again, and I never saw combat. But try telling that to 90% of post-9/11 veterans, and the response is "Bulls**t you f*****g pussy, you didn't even go to Iraq.""    Routh was there in Haiti with me    Unidentified US soldier recalls being deployed overseas with Eddie Ray Routh    Others recall chilling connections to killers in their childhoods - before they went on to commit heinous acts of violence.  "In grade school I sat next to this guy named George," someone writes. "Super quiet kid, and occasionally I would go over his house after school. His mom would occasionally be our substitute teacher.  "Fast forward to when I am in college and go to pick up a NY Post in the morning. I see the headline "THREE STRIKES, SHE'S OUT ... KID BEATS MOM TO DEATH WITH BASEBALL BAT". And there was a photo of George and his mom."    The Healthcare Serial Killers dubbed the 'Angels of death'                   5  show all         The Healthcare Serial Killers dubbed the 'Angels of death'               1/5  Colin Norris   Colin Norris used insulin to kill patients, targeting frail elderly women in 2002 while working at two Leeds hospitals.

He was jailed for life in March 2008, when he was 32, after he was found guilty of four counts of murder along with attempting to kill another woman at Leeds General Infirmary and the city's St James's Hospital.

Detectives said he showed no remorse and he has always protested his innocence and denied injecting patients with insulin.   PA     2/5  Benjamin Green   In 2006 Geen, who was then 25, was given 17 life sentences after he was found guilty of murdering two of his patients and attacking 15 others.

His trial heard that Geen gave them injections of drugs such as muscle relaxants, insulin and sedatives to stop them breathing while working at the Horton Hospital in Banbury, Oxfordshire.

The court also heard of his thrill at attempting to revive these patients.   pa     3/5  Anne Grigg-Booth   The 52-year-old was found dead at home after taking a drug overdose in 2005, eight months before she was due to go on trial accused of murdering three elderly women at Airedale General Hospital, near Keighley, and the attempted murder of a middle-aged man.

She had worked at the hospital for 25 years and was also facing 13 counts of unlawfully administering poison to 12 other patients.

The charges related to her injecting patients with high doses of painkilling drugs such as morphine and diamorphine while she worked on the night shift.   PA     4/5  Harold Shipman   Dr Harold Shipman, one of the most prolific serial killers the UK has known, was convicted at Preston Crown Court in 2000 of the murder of 15 of his patients while he was a general practitioner in Hyde, near Manchester.
Police also investigated allegations that he might have murdered many more patients while he was working in Hyde, Todmorden and Pontefract.
A major inquiry into his activities concluded the doctor killed about 250 patients between 1971 and 1998.   PA     5/5  Victorino Chua   Victorino Chua was found guilty of murdering two patients and poisoning 19 others at the Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport. 
He killed and poisoned his victims using insulin.
He wrote a 13-page letter discovered by police that stated: "They thought I'm a nice person but there a devil in me. I know if I go, I go straight to hell no question ask."   Rex Features        Some reveal how they cannot even begin to understand what motivates people they once knew to 'snap'.  "I went to school with a popular guy, on the pro athlete team, but always kept to himself," a Redditor says. "He seemed to only interact with others when he was playing with his teammates. But he wasn't awkwardly quiet or anything.  "But then he was on the news for killing his gf, gf's mom, and little sister (minor). Police found him walking down the street with blood all over him.  "It just seems weird because you know this person and it makes you wonder what made them react to that extent."    You wonder what made them react to that extent    A contributor recalls going to school with someone who went on to murder his girlfriend and her family    And there are even some users who talk about deaths as family legend.  "One day I was working on a family tree, and I'm quizzing my mom about different names and connections and stuff," a user writes.  "Then out of nowhere she tosses out, "And then there was old Aunt Tillie, who strangled a little boy in her living room."  Another says: "I found when I was like 13 that both my grandfather and uncle had killed. I never met either of them.  "My uncle killed 2 people. The first one he stabbed a guy like 80 times, slit his throat ear to ear and then cut him from b***s to throat.  "He wrote on the walls with the guys blood, kinda Charles Manson like. The second person was a woman he met at the bar. He stabbed her around 70 times and dismembered her."  Others describe what it's like to work with people who have committed murder.

"Many of the clients' index offenses are murder or attempted murder. Because of the circumstances of their crimes they are usually in the paper with varying degrees of follow-up media attention.  "When new staff first transition to the unit they are shocked at how generally stable most of the clients are.

(Deadspin question)      This was a question on Deadspin Funbag .  Chris:  So there's this Washington Post story going around about a bat-**** German guy who killed his geezer wife and claims to be an Iraqi general. Thing is, I've SEEN this guy around Georgetown for years  I've walked past him at least a few times.  It got me thinking  how many times have I crossed paths with certifiable killers? It has to be a surprisingly high number, right?  It depends on where you live. If you live somewhere with a high murder rate... SURPRISE! You may have shaken hands with Monster Kody Scott. But if you grew up on the mean streets of Wayzata, Minn., as I did, that number is probably negligible (and I don't count military personnel, I'm talking people who have maliciously killed others). Since the year I was born (1976), there have been roughly 20,000 murders in the US per year, which would make for 680,000 murders over the course of my lifetime. That's a few hundred thousand murderers to potentially stumble across, so I guess you might shake hands with one of two in your travels. I went to school with a murderer.   In July, Mr. Ko was convicted of second-degree murder for killing Hyseung Lynda Hong, 26, in her Manhattan apartment in March 1998, slashing her throat in what prosecutors described as an attack intended to impress a jealous girlfriend.  I think I might have said hi to him at one point or another. I can't really remember. It's not a terribly comforting thought.

(Deadspin question)      For people in urban areas, chances are fairly good.  It's easy to meet 2000 in your life and if 1 in 2000 people are murderers (this looks to be a reasonable estimate), then your chances of meeting one become 1 - 1/e ~ 63% just from random chance.  But to my knowledge, I have yet to meet one.      Last edited by tringlomane; 09-14-2011 at 04:39 PM .

(Deadspin question)      Ouch! I love Vicky Coren's articles, but missed that one. Since I'm British, Vicky's British and neither of us are murderers (as far as I know), I think we can safely say that about 33.3333% of British poker players are murderers. Statistics are rigged, obviously.

Photograph: Public domain     I n 1987, Adrian Raine, who describes himself as a neurocriminologist, moved from Britain to the US. His emigration was prompted by two things. The first was a sense of banging his head against a wall. Raine, who grew up in Darlington and is now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was a researcher of the biological basis for criminal behaviour, which, with its echoes of Nazi eugenics, was perhaps the most taboo of all academic disciplines.  In Britain, the causes of crime were allowed to be exclusively social and environmental, the result of disturbed or impoverished nurture, rather than fated and genetic nature. To suggest otherwise, as Raine felt compelled to, having studied under Richard Dawkins and been persuaded of the "all-embracing influence of evolution on behaviour", was to doom yourself to an absence of funding. In America, there seemed more open-mindedness on the question and, as a result, more money to explore it. There was also another good reason why Raine headed initially to California: there were more murderers to study than there were at home.  When Raine started doing brain scans of murderers in American prisons, he was among the first researchers to apply the evolving science of brain imaging to violent criminality. His most comprehensive study, in 1994, was still, necessarily, a small sample. He conducted PET [positron emission tomography] scans of 41 convicted killers and paired them with a "normal" control group of 41 people of similar age and profile. However limited the control, the colour images, which showed metabolic activity in different parts of the brain, appeared striking in comparison. In particular, the murderers' brains showed what appeared to be a significant reduction in the development of the prefrontal cortex, "the executive function" of the brain, compared with the control group.  The advancing understanding of neuroscience suggested that such a deficiency would result in an increased likelihood of a number of behaviours: less control over the limbic system that generates primal emotions such as anger and rage; a greater addiction to risk; a reduction in self-control; and poor problem-solving skills, all traits that might predispose a person to violence.  Even two decades ago, these were difficult findings to publish, however. When Raine presented a far less controversial paper in 1994 to a peer group, one that showed a combination of birth complications and early maternal rejection in babies had significant correlation with individuals becoming violent offenders 18 years later, it was denounced as "racist and ideologically motivated" and, according to Nature magazine, was simply further strong evidence that "the uproar surrounding attempts to find biological causes for social problems will continue". Similarly, when, 15 years ago, at the urging of his friend Jonathan Kellerman, the child psychologist and crime writer, Raine put together a proposal for a book on some of his scientific findings, no publisher would touch it. That book, The Anatomy of Violence , a clear-headed, evidence-based and carefully provocative account of Raine's 35 years of study, has only now appeared.  The reason for this delay seems mired in ideological enmities. For all Raine's rigour, his discipline of "neurocriminology" still remains tarnished, for some, by association with 19th-century phrenology, the belief that criminal behaviour stemmed from defective brain organisation as evidenced in the shape of the skull. The idea was first proposed by the infamous Franz Joseph Gall, who claimed to have identified over- or underdeveloped brain "organs" that gave rise to specific character: the organ of destructiveness, of covetousness and so on, which were recognisable to the phrenologist by bumps on the head. Phrenology was widely influential in criminal law in both the United States and Europe in the middle of the 1800s, and often used to support crude racial and class-based stereotypes of criminal behaviour.  The divisive thinking was developed further in 1876 by Cesare Lombroso, an Italian surgeon, after he conducted a postmortem on a serial murderer and rapist. Lombroso discovered a hollow part of the killer's brain, where the cerebellum would be, from which he proposed that violent criminals were throwbacks to less evolved human types, again identifiable by ape-like physical characteristics. The political manipulation of such hypotheses in the eugenics movement eventually saw them wholly outlawed and discredited.  As one result, after the second world war, crime became attributable to economic and political factors, or psychological disturbances, but not to biology. Prompted by advances in genetics and neuroscience, however, that consensus is increasingly fragile, and the implications of those scientific advances for law – and for concepts such as culpability and responsibility – are only now being tested. He draws on a number of studies that show the links between brain development, in particular – and brain injury and impairment by extension – and criminal violence. Already legal defence teams, particularly in the US, are using brain scans and neuroscience as mitigating evidence in the trials of violent criminals and sex offenders. In this sense, Raine believes a proper public debate on the implications of his science is long overdue.  Raine was in part drawn to his discipline by his own background. In the course of scanning his murderers, Raine also examined his own PET profile and found, somewhat to his alarm, that the structure of his brain seemed to share more characteristics with the psychopathic murderers than with the control group.  He laughs quickly when I ask how that discovery felt. "When you have a brain scan that looks like a serial killer's it does give you pause," he says. And there were other factors: he has always had a markedly low heart rate (which his research has shown to be a truer indicator of a capacity for violence than, say, smoking is as a cause of lung cancer). He was plagued by cracked lips as a child, evidence of riboflavin deficiency (another marker); he was born at home; he was a blue baby, all factors in the kind of developmental difficulties that might set his own researcher's alarm bells ringing.  "So," he says, "I was on the spectrum. And in fact I did have some issues. I was taken to hospital aged five to have my stomach pumped because I had drunk a lot of alcohol. From age nine to 11 I was pretty antisocial, in a gang, smoking, letting car tyres down, setting fire to mailboxes, and fighting a lot, even though I was quite small. But at that age I burnt out of that somehow. At 11, I changed schools, got more interested in studying and really became a different sort of kid. Still, when I was graduating and thinking 'what shall I research?', I looked back on the essays I'd written and one of the best was on the biology of psychopaths; I was fascinated by that, partly, I think, because I had always wondered about that early behaviour in myself."  As Raine began to explore the subject more, he began to look at the reasons he became a researcher of violent criminality, rather than a violent criminal. (Recent studies suggest his biology might equally have propelled him towards other careers – bomb disposal expert, corporate executive or journalist – that tend to attract individuals with those "psychopathic" traits.) Despite his unusual brain structure, he didn't have the low IQ that is often apparent in killers, or any cognitive dysfunction. Still, as he worked for four years interviewing people in prison, a lot of the time he was thinking: what stopped me being on their side of the bars?  Raine's biography, then, was a good corrective to the seductive idea that our biology is our fate and that a brain scan can tell us who we are. Even as he piles up evidence to show that people are not the free-thinking, rational agents they like to imagine themselves to be – entirely liberated from the limitations set by our inherited genes and our particular neuroanatomy – he never forgets that lesson. The question remains, however, that if these "biomarkers" do exist and exert an influence – and you begin to see the evidence as incontrovertible – then what should we do about them?  Perhaps we should do nothing, simply ignore them, assume, when it comes to crime, that every individual has much the same brain, the same capacity to make moral choices, as we tend to do now. As Raine suggests: "The sociologist would say if we concentrate on these biological things, or even acknowledge them, we are immediately taking our eyes off other causes of criminal behaviour – poverty, bad neighbourhoods, poor nutrition, lack of education and so on. All things that need to change. And that concern is correct. It is why social scientists have fought this science for so long."  The implication of neurocriminology, though – where it differs from the crude labelling of phrenology, say – is that the choice it presents is not an either/or between nurture and nature, but a more complex understanding of how our biology reacts with its environment. Reading Raine's account of the most recent research into these reactions, it still seems to me quite new and surprising that environmental factors change the physical structure of the brain. We tend to talk about a child's development in terms of more esoteric ideas of mind rather than material brain structures, but the more you look at the data the clearer the evidence that abuse or neglect or poor nutrition or prenatal smoking and drinking have a real effect on whether or not those healthy neural connections – which lead to behaviour associated with maturity, self-control and empathy – are made. The science of this is called epigenetics, the way our environment regulates the expression of our innate genetic code.  One result of epigenetics might be, Raine suggests, that "social scientists can actually win from this. I mean, if a child experiences a murder in his or her neighbourhood, we have found that their test scores on a range of measures go down. There is something happening in the brain as a result of that experience of violence to affect cognition. So social scientists can have their cake and eat it. They can say look, we can prove that these environmental social factors are causing brain impairment, which leads to some real, measurable problems."  One difficulty of embracing this "epigenetical" idea of crime is the degree to which such factors should be taken into account in courts of law. There have been several landmark cases in recent years in which particular neurological disorders caused by blows to the skull or undetected tumours have resulted in arguable changes in character and behaviour – and the violent or sexual crime is blamed on the disorder, not the individual. In most of these cases, it has been argued by the prosecution that brain imaging is prejudicial, that the brightly coloured pictures are too compelling to a jury and more emotional than scientific. But if neural scanning becomes more routine, and neuroscience more precise, will there not come a point where most violent behaviour – that of the Boston bombers, say, or the Newtown killer – is argued away in court as an illness, rather than a crime?  Raine believes that there might well be. He even likens such a shift to our change in perception of cancer, until fairly recently often deemed the "fault" of the sufferer because of some repressive character trait. "If we buy into the argument that for some people factors beyond their control, factors in their biology, greatly raise the risk of them becoming offenders, can we justly turn a blind eye to that?" Raine asks. "Is it really the fault of the innocent baby whose mother smoked heavily in pregnancy that he went on to commit crimes? Or if he was battered from pillar to post, or even if he was born with a, abnormally low resting heart rate, how harshly should we punish him? How much should we say he is responsible? There is, and increasingly will be, an argument that he is not fully responsible and therefore, when we come to think of punishment, should we be thinking of more benign institutions than prison?"  But then there is a further thought, that if you start to see criminality as a biological illness, where does a sense of retributive justice stand?  Raine himself was forced to face this dilemma when he became a victim of violent crime. As he recounts in his book, while on holiday in Turkey several years ago, a burglar entered his bedroom and in the struggle that followed tried to cut Raine's throat with a knife. He fought the attacker off, but when the following morning he was presented with two possible suspects by police, he admits to not only choosing the one who looked most like a thug [the man later admitted the crime, under duress], but also to wanting to visit on him the terror he had felt himself.  "I wasn't proud to discover I was a bit Jekyll and Hyde – perhaps we all are in that situation," Raine says when I ask him about his response. "The rational Dr Jekyll knew that if I took this man's brain scan and found he had prefrontal dysfunction, low resting heart rate, a background of neglect, then of course I should cut him some slack. With understanding comes mercy. But the Mr Hyde, the emotional voice in my head, was saying nothing of the sort: he was saying, he cut my throat, I want to cut his. That event changed me from someone dead set against the death penalty to someone who wouldn't be ruled out of a jury on a capital case in America. I think now my mind will always go backwards and forwards on this, the scientific understanding of the causes of crime versus being a human in society with all these gut reactions to people who commit awful crimes."  If the neuroscience raises as many questions as it answers about culpability after a crime has been committed, what about its role in crime prevention? Here, the questions seem no less fraught.  One of them was posed a couple of years ago by the arch-inquisitor Jeremy Paxman of Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty, on Newsnight . "If science could predict with 100% certainty who was going to commit a violent crime, would it be legitimate to act before they commit that crime?"  Chakrabarti was in no doubt: "I would have to say that in a liberal society of human beings, and not animals, my answer to your question would be 'no'."  But if such intervention could prevent Newtown, you wonder, or Dunblane, would any of us be quite so certain? The fact is that the reality will always be a much greyer area because even the most nuanced neuroscience will never produce a perfect prediction of human behaviour. But is there a point at which the science – in identifying the possibility of repeat offending, for example – will be accurate enough to warrant routine scanning of those on the sexual offenders' register?  "The fact is," Raine says, "parole boards are making exactly these kind of predictive decisions every day about which prisoner or young offender we are going to release early, often with crummy evidence. At the moment, the predictors are social and behavioural factors, marital status, your past record. What is not used are biological measures. But I believe that if we added those things even now into the equation, we could only improve the prediction."  Raine cites two very recent brain-imaging studies to back this up. One is a study in New Mexico in which prisoners are scanned on release. "What they are discovering is that if the functioning of the anterior cingulate, part of the limbic system, is lower than normal before release, they are twice as likely to be reconvicted in the next three years. And that marker is more accurate a guide than all other social factors," Raine says. A second study apparently shows if a released prisoner has a significantly smaller volume in the amygdala, the almond-shaped part of the brain crucial for processing memory and emotion, he or she is three times more likely to reoffend. "Now, this is only two studies, but what they are beginning to show is proof of concept, that if we added neurological factors into the equation we could do a better job at predicting future behaviour."  At the end of his book, Raine suggests various possible Orwellian futures of such science, an ethical "slippery slope" of interventions that ultimately imagines a society that assesses the biological risk of all individuals – a wide-scale version of We Need to Talk About Kevin – and pre-emptively locks up those at the extreme end of the curve (a sort of evidence-based Guantánamo). He by no means advocates any of it, though when I ask if he would have his own children, two boys of 11, scanned, he suggests he probably would.  "If there was the opportunity for screening at school or through a GP programme, would I do it? Well, if my kids had problems, as a parent I would want to know about them and I would want to know how I might deal with them. If you brought in such things as emotion regulation and impulse control, which we know are risk factors for behaviour, then to me, as a parent, I would sort of want to know what could be done to help with those."  It is perhaps not too wildly far-fetched to imagine that such scans will one day be as routine as immunisation programmes; the bigger question then will be how we begin to react to the results. Raine rather likes the idea of public health programmes as crime prevention: "The teenage brain is still very malleable. There is good evidence from randomised control testing that omega-3 [fish oil] has a positive effect on young offenders, and even mindfulness seems to improve behaviour and brain structures."  You can't help thinking: if only it were as simple as that.  • This article was amended on Sunday 12 May 2013. Adrian Raine is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, not Philadelphia as we mistakenly said in the original article. This has been corrected.  • This article was amended on Monday 13 May. A paragraph that misrepresented the views of the neuroscientist David Eagleman has been removed. The paragraph implied that Eagleman believed that the possession of particular genes resulted in criminal behaviour. This is not his belief, in his words, "Genes are part of the story, but they're not the whole story. We are likewise influenced by the environments in which we grow up".

Advertisement Chris: So there's this Washington Post story going around about a bat-shit German guy who killed his geezer wife and claims to be an Iraqi general. Thing is, I've SEEN this guy around Georgetown for years — I've walked past him at least a few times. It got me thinking — how many times have I crossed paths with certifiable killers? It has to be a surprisingly high number, right? Advertisement It depends on where you live. If you live somewhere with a high murder rate... SURPRISE! You may have shaken hands with Monster Kody Scott. But if you grew up on the mean streets of Wayzata, Minn., as I did, that number is probably negligible (and I don't count military personnel, I'm talking people who have maliciously killed others). Since the year I was born (1976), there have been roughly 20,000 murders in the US per year, which would make for 680,000 murders over the course of my lifetime. That's a few hundred thousand murderers to potentially stumble across, so I guess you might shake hands with one of two in your travels. I went to school with a murderer. In July, Mr. Ko was convicted of second-degree murder for killing Hyseung Lynda Hong, 26, in her Manhattan apartment in March 1998, slashing her throat in what prosecutors described as an attack intended to impress a jealous girlfriend. I think I might have said hi to him at one point or another. I can't really remember. It's not a terribly comforting thought. Advertisement BJP: One stat breakdown that you never see and (presumably) never will is dick size. Think about it for a minute. As an example, we don't know the breakdown of men with prostate cancer by dick size. Maybe the probability of a person with a 2-inch or smaller dick getting cancer is less than 10% but once you get into the 8-inch or larger category it is 85%. Maybe people with dick sizes between 6 and 8 inches have a higher likelihood of being psychopathic killers than all other sizes. We just don't know but maybe we should! Keeping track of dick size may save lives!! Worth considering, no? Indeed. Doing a sociological study of men by penis size could help destroy certain myths. For example, what if we found out that the majority of Corvette owners have HUGE dicks? Maybe they aren't overcompensating for anything. In fact, maybe they bought a sports car specifically because they have a huge dick but can't say anything about it in polite company? That would destroy conventional wisdom. You could do an entire dickonomic study on whether or not men with big dicks are smarter, better educated, wealthier, or blacker. You could also do a racial breakdown to see if what they say about Asian men having small penises is true (And I bet it is!). You could study mating habits by penis size. You could do a geographical study of penis sizes. What is the most well-endowed city in the US? Is it East St. Louis? I bet it's East St. Louis. Do men with big penises eat more tacos? WHY? It's all in play. Advertisement BJ: Does it bother you at all that after 11am comes 12pm and after 11pm comes 12am? I have always thought this was retarded So then, under your model, 12PM would actually be 12AM, and the PMs wouldn't start until an hour later with 1PM, yes? That does make sense. But if I tried to actually adjust to that, my head would fall off of my body. So the old way remains. Advertisement Jake: Say you were given command of an NFL team. You are allowed to assemble your offense from any players you want in the whole league—even guys already signed by other teams. But because Goodell is a prick, you aren't allowed to have a QB. That includes guys like Brad Smith and Josh Cribbs who have played the position in college. You are still allowed to throw the ball, but obviously that is a very limited option without a QB. You are able to assemble an elite team of tailbacks and run-blockers, but opposing teams are able to prepare for your team without having to worry about the passing game. How many games do you think this team could win? I think you could win four or five games. Advertisement Well, you'd still have a literal QB position, someone to take snaps. It's just that you'd be using a back or a wideout to do the job, which means you'd basically have an All-Pro football team run by an extremely inexperienced but presumably athletic quarterback (the 2002 Steelers, basically). If you had a Top 5 defense on the other side of the ball, you could probably get seven or eight wins out of it, or even more, depending on the schedule, because even bad QBs can make decent plays against shitty defenses (especially with all the rules against hitting the passer now). If Percy Harvin were your QB, you'd have a whole season to get him acclimated to the position permanently, and to install whatever rollouts and simple passes you think suit him best. I'm the kind of person who gets extremely excited whenever a running back or wideout throws the ball, which makes no sense because why should I be excited about someone throwing the ball who clearly isn't as well-suited for it as the QB? I also get really fucking jazzed if a team's QBs all get injured in one game and the specter of using a skill player as an emergency QB becomes a real threat. When that becomes a possibility, I openly root for the last QB standing to get his knee blown to shit. Same with nonpitchers being forced to pitch in games, especially if it's Jose Canseco doing the pitching. Sports novelties are AWESOME. Greg: Hanging up on somebody used to be the equivalent of giving them the finger then disappearing in a cloud of smoke, leaving them alone with their rage and a useless phone in their hand. Nowadays, everyone knows all too well that cell phones - and iPhones in particular - drop calls all the time, so if you angrily hang up on somebody, odds are this person will assume the call got dropped and call you right back, completely missing the message you were trying to convey. The only opportunity for a true old school hang up is when both parties know full well that they are both using landlines - as someone who doesn't have a house phone, that means work calls only, and I don't have nearly the clout required to survive such a move at work. I look forward to the day when we come full circle and all have very reliable satellite phones, leaving no doubt that yes, I just hung up on you. Advertisement Well now, wait a second. I still think you can make it perfectly clear to the other person that you ended the call on purpose. If you ramp up to your hangup with, "You know what? FUCK YOU. This conversation's over, asshole," and then press END, the person on the other line would have to be a real idiot to be like, "Whoa hey! I think he lost reception!" The real crime of cell phones is that you aren't allowed the physical gratification of slamming the phone down. You can't be like, FUCK YOU, and then bash the receiver into the phone base. Now you say FUCK YOU and then thumb around for the end button for two seconds before pressing it angrily, which isn't anywhere near as fun. Ever have a friend who ends calls too abruptly? My best friend does this all the time. We'll be talking and the conversation will end without me prepared for it at all. HIM: So you're gonna be there? ME: Yeah, I'll be there around eight. HIM: Got it. (HANGS UP) Whoa hey, I wasn't ready for that. You have to prepare me for the fact that you're about to hang up. There needs to be a "see ya" or a "good bye." You can't just cut me off like that. I HAVE FEELINGS, JEREMY. Advertisement By the way, I was in the store yesterday and there was a woman in the produce aisle screaming at someone in her phone. Real screaming. Just reaming the shit out of whoever was on the other end of the line. And I shouldn't point out that she was black, but MY GOD SHE WAS REAL BLACK AND REAL LOUD. And she was all like, "No! You are NOT listening to me, no you are NOT!" And I was like, "How could he not be listening to you? The whole fucking world can hear you." And she kept at it for minutes at a time while everyone else just stared and felt awkward and horrible. And I kept wondering why the person on the other end didn't just hang up. Who sticks around for that kind of lambasting? I would have hung up after three seconds. She was already yelling at me at top volume. What was she gonna do, yell more? One other thing: I saw a guy in town today with an iPhone in his pocket and, extending out from the iPhone, a blue old school phone handset, so he's sitting in the middle of town talking on a handset going into his pocket. What a fucking asshat. I hope he got hit by a van. Ted: Carl Monday goes to my gym. I see him there on average once a week. Tuesday was "Shoulders Day" for Cleveland's premier investigative reporter. He also is the type of person that shamelessly fills up an entire water bottle with multiple people and mounting frustration waiting behind him. Each time I see him, I am torn between being nervous or being able to rest assured about my gym choice. On the one hand, I should feel confident because Carl Monday most definitely did his homework on choosing a place that could potentially be swarming with staph infections, steroids, bacchanalia in the men's showers, etc. Furthermore, I would assume management would recognize who he is and the potential embarrassment a douche like him could cause, forcing the club to maintain a high standard. On the other hand, I constantly think that he may be undercover and performing a year plus long investigation into some seedy actions or unsanitary conditions and that I am destined to get a staph infection. Either way, I need to join a new gym, right? Advertisement I think you do. Because what if Carl is always poking around the locker room to see if you're masturbating? What if he set up a camera in the steam room to catch you jacking off even though no one else is around and it's clearly off-peak hours? I wouldn't want some narc like that ruining my good time. The Most Brilliant Thing You&apos;ll See All Day So a local television station in Cleveland decided to put together an "investigative… Read more Read (NOTE: I accidentally left my gym bag in my car all weekend long, with the smelly clothes left to ferment for 48 hours in car heat, which is much worse than regular heat. When I took the bag in this afternoon and smelled it... Oh, man. That was something. Like someone drowned you in ammonia. Highly recommended.) Advertisement HALFTIME! David: Not that I give 2 shits about NASCAR, but I couldn't help but notice that despite losing his driver's license for 45 days, Kyle Busch is still allowed to participate in a Truck Series (?) race during that time. What the fuck? It seems like if you're not allowed to drive on a regular road, you shouldn't be allowed to drive really fast in circles professionally. My question: Is there an actual legal code that allows NASCAR drivers to break the law in controlled environments, or is it just a cultural understanding? And secondly, and more importantly, if you could participate in any recreational activity that, under normal circumstances, would find you afoul of the law, what would it be? Advertisement If you can believe it, a driver's license is NOT required to be a NASCAR driver. I assume this is because NASCAR races take place on a closed course in a controlled environment, and because race cars are completely different vehicles from normal passenger cars, and because the law down South differentiates between "drivin'" and "racin'", with "racin'" falling under the purview of a 12-man committee of moonshiners and immigrant smugglers. But I think it would add a whole lot more spice to NASCAR if drivers who ran afoul of traffic laws were subject to the same license suspensions that you and I had to deal with. I'd love to see NASCAR drivers arrive at the garage to find a Denver boot on the wheel. Or seeing a driver with multiple DUI convictions forced to blow into a government-mandated Breathalyzer device every time he starts a race. Aaron: Do you think the President could acquire a bag of weed if he wanted one? If Obama decided one day that he could really go for a good toke, it would be extremely difficult for him to actually pull it off. Obviously a normal dealer is out of the question, because nobody goes near the president without being frisked by ten secret service agents. He could try to get one of his secret service guys who is actually allowed near him to pick it up, but to get that job, they have to take all kinds of lie detector tests to prove that they have never been tainted by the evils of illegal drugs, so the guy would probably wind up spending 200 of YOUR TAX DOLLARS on a bag of oregano. Advertisement Of course the President can acquire a bag of weed. I know Obama can be lacking in backbone at times, but even he has the pull to get his hands on prime weed if he needs it. He can probably ask a friend with a prescription. He can ask an aide, who would negotiate through a third party without the President's name ever attached. I assume that all you have to do if you're President is to ask and any number of shadowy government forces will set the process into motion. If a President can secretly bomb Laos, then getting weed isn't a problem at all. Same with heroin, coke, whatever. It behooves your Presidential lackeys to please you, lest they find themselves suddenly fired and with a story about their necrophilia habits planted in the Washington Post. Don't think it doesn't happen EVERY DAY in American politics. Patrick: Do you ever wonder whether someone you only sort-of know has based their entire opinion of you on one thing? Like ONE DAY you forgot to brush your teeth and all of a sudden they're like "Oh, you mean Patrick with the bad breath?" This idea terrifies me. Advertisement That's like when you get caught masturbating, as I was caught by my roommate's girlfriend in college. You go from "Hey, that's Drew," to "Hey, that's Drew who masturbates" instantly. AS IF NO ONE ELSE MASTURBATES! So unfair, I tell you! The worst part about it is knowing other people are thinking that about you. I got so paranoid about people talking about me being caught masturbating that I once brought it up to a girl I had been hooking up with who had suddenly stopped hooking up with me (NOTE: If a girl suddenly stops hooking up with you, NEVER go back and ask why). And I was like, "Don't play coy with me! WHAT DID YOU HEAR?" As if that were going to help matters at all. Either she wasn't going to explain, or she was gonna confirm every horrible fear I had about being caught jacking it. Fantastic options right there. God, I hate old me. Tarks Towel: So, I have never understood the idea of a cold shower. If I am left frustrated sexually, wouldn't just a warm shower and jerking yourself while showering be more effective and accomplish the purpose at hand (pun intended)? Advertisement Most definitely. I think when most people say, "I'm gonna need a cold shower," they mean it as a figure of speech. I don't think any guy with blueballs has ever literally been like, "God, I'm so hot and bothered! I better go take a shower in subfreezing temperatures! That'll work way better than masturbating!" That would be idiotic. I've tried doing the cold shower thing on crazy hot summer days, when it sounds like a good idea to take a cold shower but isn't all that fun in practice. I always step in try and convince myself it's refreshing, only to turn the heat up five seconds later. I prefer comfort. Ever have your hot water fail on you before going to work?

Also the fight is in a neutral location such as the Mandalay Bay events center so we could gamble on it. And in that case what are the money lines? I've discussed this with my friends for close to a decade and most people seem to think polar bear. Either way I think it would be a great fight. Advertisement Full grown gorillas can lift upwards of a ton, depending upon whom you ask. They can weigh up to 500 pounds. The largest polar bear on record weighed over 2,000 lbs. So the polar bear has an enormous size advantage over the silverback. Polar bears can also run upwards of 25mph, although they shrink like bitches when faced with a little bit of global warming. The silverback would have advantages in terms of dexterity, what with its long arms and opposable thumbs. Do gorillas know how to do a choke hold? Because I could see the silverback jumping on top of the bear and choking the bear to death. But I think size would win out and the bear would eventually prevail. I assume Vegas oddsmakers would make the bear a favorite. Then I'd expect Simmons to bitch about that line being too high and declare, "Vegas clearly has no idea what to make of this matchup." Larry: How many pounds of deli meat do you think you could eat in a single sitting? We get a pound and a half of ham from the store every Monday. And the deli guy always does a double take when I say a pound and a half, as if it was some kind of mistake. No, motherfucker. I didn't say half a pound. I said 1.5 pounds. GIMME GIMME GIMME. Then they slice it and it makes a huge tower on the scale and I have to hold myself back to not dive into the tower and begin making sweet love to the stack. And when we get it home I always eat about two-thirds of it right out of the bag immediately. Nothing can quench my insatiable ham lust. It's so good right when it's been freshly sliced. So salty. So hammy. I take a wad and stuff it in my foodhole like it's Red Man. It's a repulsive thing to behold. I could easily eat the whole bag in one sitting. Beyond that, I'd probably die of nitrate poisoning. Advertisement Our store has a deli kiosk, where you can order your shit on a touch screen and then come back after you've gotten all your other crap and your deli meat is waiting for you. When it works, this is the greatest thing ever. I just stroll on up past the old ladies, grab my meat, fart, and peel out of there. It feels incredible. But other times, the kiosk is broken, or the fuckhead deli guy never bothered to check the ticker tape printout. HAM FOUL. And the touch screen only includes slicing preferences for certain meats. If you order bologna, it asks you if you want THICK, MEDIUM, or THIN (there should be a SHAVE IT LIKE A PENTHOUSE VAGINA option, but I digress). But it doesn't offer the same options for ham, which means the fate of my meat is left in the hands of the slicer, who is always too lazy to go to thin slicing and always hands you back a pound of ham in three slices. Ever have your deli meat go bad after three days in the fridge, when it gets all slimy? I eat it anyway. No shame. Anon: How long do you think it takes to film the average porn scene, (25-30 minutes)? I know the guys juice up with Viagra, etc. but I figure they can't pound away on some chick's ass for 30 minutes without blowing a wad. Advertisement I don't think it takes very long, because most every porn movie is shot on a low budget, so the emphasis is on getting to the money shot and moving on with your shooting day. Unless you're talking about an Andrew Blake movie. I assume it takes Andrew Blake 5 hours just to light one vagina properly. The man is an artist. Otherwise, I think 30 minutes to an hour would be about right. You have to set up the light, position the camera, get the actors in place, get them doing it, then change angles as appropriate (almost always to a tight angle, which makes no sense to me. I'd happily splurge on any DVD collection of wide-angle only porn). Also, everyone is probably on cocaine during the shooting, so things move fast, even if all porn scenes always go on too long. Nate: Given enough time in a coma, your muscles will atrophy. This includes your arms, legs, etc. What about the muscles needed to ejaculate? Say you wake up from a coma and A.) you physically can't rub one out because you can't move your arms, B.) even if you can move your arms, you can't ejaculate. I know the first thing I would want to do after a 15 year coma would be to wank. Maybe as part of physical therapy someone gives you a tugjob? Advertisement Well, the muscle that controls ejaculation would probably still work because I assume those muscles are involuntary and would continue to function while you were in a coma. You'd still pee while in a coma. You could still have wet dreams (oooh coma wet dream). You heart would still beat. Certain muscles would continue to be used. Your arms and legs are different because you consciously control them, so they would atrophy. So you could conceivably wake up able to ejaculate but perhaps too weak for a full on jerking session, in which case I assume you'd work up the strength to either use your arm or hump the rolling metal stand that carries your IV. Either way, that would be one big load. Email of the week time. Salmendav: Am I the only one who hoards conversational nuggets? Let's say I have to hang out with my sister's new boyfriend who I know isn't into sports, or probably anything socially acceptable for that matter. I do possess however, the exciting knowledge that he has recently been to Florida. So the first awkward silence that comes along I tell myself, 'Easy cowpoke, let's save the big guns for a longer, more awkward silence'. And instead say 'I see you are wearing Wranglers, I like a man of substance and style'. Which means I will be asking about Florida in ten awkward seconds. Advertisement Good nuggets. LOFTY nuggets.

Leo Qin  Data Science and Funny Math         Home  Blog  Contact  Resume                         How Many Murderers Will You Walk Past?      Note: the below is an exercise in Fermi estimation , which is a great way of making accurate, if not precise, estimates based on very little data.  Yesterday, as I was browsing Facebook, I saw a picture stating that “The average person walks past a murder 36 times in their life.” Surely, this is an extraordinary claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If there’s one thing that clickbait pictures from 9gag do not contain, it’s extraordinary evidence. So, let’s test their claim. How many murderers will an average person walk past in their life?   First, let’s unpack that question:   The scope of the question is murderers (let’s assume unique murderers, so if one of your coworkers were a murderer you would only count them once no matter how times you interacted)  The scale of the question is average people, which means that we can use aggregated data and only have to worry about the population described in aggregate  Walk past implies a very low level of interaction, but is inclusive of higher levels. That lady at the grocery store with whom you were competing for the last jar of your favorite peanut butter counts, but so does your mom.  In their life indicates that the question is not iterative, and is limited only to the time frame in which the observer is alive.   Great, now let’s set some assumptions and examine if they are reasonable:   You live in the United States – our crime rate is rather high, which may be a function of reporting, but the rate for murders is actually below the average for the world (but still higher than Europe, Asia, and Oceania). North and South America actually have the highest intentional homicide rate in the world. Let’s keep it simple.  You can only walk past a murderer on the street if they got away with murder – Popular TV shows say that once two days has elapsed since the murder, it is unlikely to the solved. In reality, the truth is unlikely to be that easy, but there’s also very little data on the topic otherwise. We may have to give this one a pass.  The average murderer only kills one person – Dr. Mike Aamodt at Radford University has compiled a dataset on the basic statistics of serial killers . It contains data on 3873 serial killers and 11,187 victims, or approximately 2.89 victims per serial killer. Such a low number brings into question the definition of serial killer, but it also tells us that this is a safe assumption.  The average person walks past some number of people every day. This number is vague and contentious, so we’ll deal with it later.   And finally, let’s get our basic facts in order:   The average lifespan in the US is 78.74 years  The rate of murders in the US in 2013 was 4.5 murders per 100,000 people, or 14,196 estimated in total  The population of the US in 2014 was estimated at 322,583,006 people  One third of murders go unsolved   This is a stock photo, I swear.  Out of 78.74 years, let’s say that the average person is ambulatory and social for 75 of them. That’s 75 years, or 27,375 days (not counting leap years) during which you might walk past a murderer.  One third of murders go unsolved, so 1.5 murders per 100,000 people go unsolved. Extending on the basis of our third assumption, that means that the rate of unapprehended murderer in the US is 1.5 per 100,000 people, or 4838 at any given time. That is 0.0015% of the population.  That just leaves the fourth assumption: how many people does one walk past every day? This depends to some degree on lifestyle. If you’re a trucker that only works night shifts, you probably have many-fold fewer interactions than does someone who works at an airport or a carnival, to give two examples. In any case, this number is contentious, so we’ll test it two different ways.  First, let’s try out a logarithmic scale distribution. Just from the previous example, it’s clear to me that some people have a lot more interactions than others. Let’s test the resultant range when we test a range that varies in a logarithmic fashion. If you meet 1 new person per day, you meet 27,375 new people throughout your entire life, of which 0.41 of them are likely to be unapprehended murderers. Of course, this means that if you meet 10 new people per day, you’ve met 4.1 murderers throughout your life, and if you meet 100 people new people per day, then you’ve met 41 murders throughout your life.  This is a very interesting result because it is actually quite close to what the picture told us. If you live in or around a city and walk somewhat frequently, it’s very conceivable that you could meet 100 new people per day. Of course, if you live in a small town, or in a city but you do not walk around a lot, 100 is less likely to be achievable. The power of the logarithmic scale is that you get a wide and diverse range without a lot of work.   Let’s try another approach to finding this number. I know that most people meet an average number of people per day, but that some meet an unusually large or small amount. Using a normal distribution, we can compute a “typical” number that the aggregated average of people might meet. Let’s pull forward the values from the logarithmic distribution and assign a quintile (or 20%) each for 1 and 100 new people per day, and the remaining three quintiles for 10 new people per day.  By calculating the distributed average, we find that (20% * 1) + (20% * 100) + (60% * 10) =  26.2 new people per day. This seems reasonable, so let’s finish the calculation.  At 26.2 new people per day, the average American meets 717,225 people throughout their lives, of which 10.76 are likely to be unapprehended murderers. Not bad. 9Gag calls their fact a fun fact because they didn’t kill you… but 10.76 murderers over 75 years really just means that they (and you) are so busy meeting people that any specific person is unlikely to be one of their victims.  Well, that was dark.            crime fermi fermi estimation logarithms math murder normal distribution              16 Responses to “ How Many Murderers Will You Walk Past? ”           Roccito  2 years ago    Reply    But people get out of prison after murdering, so the number would be much higher.

You assume they had to get away with murder in order for you to have walked past them. But the prison system is always letting prisoners out, and that includes murderers. Plus, it doesn’t say specifically that they had already murdered someone. It just states that you will walk past that many in a life time. Does this not also include people who will eventually commit murder as well as those who already have? Or does that make the number even larger?          C  9 months ago    Reply    NBC did a study and they estimate that 6,000 people a year get away with murder. That’s not 6,000 murders that is not one person getting away with more than one murder. That is 6,000 people getting away with murder and possibly more than one murder a year. 6,000 people a year get away with murder. In their estimation. That is a lot of people. And those are only the ones that get away with it. And are never charged or even looked at.          Galen Irby  1 month ago    Reply    It seems that Since most murderers only murder one person, we don’t have to worry about the murderers we pass because they’ve already met their quota. It’s everyone else that is a potential murderer that is disconcerting.          Jon  1 month ago    Reply    Well, these stats are waaayyyy off according to my own experiences. I don’t live in a city. I rarely meet many new people, but i personally know of 17 different people who got away with murder and were never suspected. Now, there was one group of 3 involved in 1 murder, and another group of 4 involved in another. There was 1 couple. But still, it just proves that many unsolved murders are never a statistic in any way. Some were passed off as OD’s, some as suicide, 1 passed off as a drowning, one a diabetic sugar crash, and 1 as “self defense.” In all cases, it just took a little planning, and BOOM, they’re dead, and the murderer(s) got away clean. So yea, no one could possibly know how many murders there really are. But it’s definitely A LOT higher than any of these “sources” could ever suspect.          Inez Mond  2 weeks ago    Reply    There’s a flaw in your math. You said that 4.5 people per 100,000 were murdered every year, divided by 3 to get 1.5 people per 100,000 who get away with murder each year . Every year of their lives afterward (that they aren’t in prison for another crime), they’re walking around adding to the total percent of murders in the population. Violent offending peaks in the late teens and early twenties, and like you say, the average US life expectancy is in the mid-seventies, so on average most of the people who got away with murder in the last 50 years are going to be alive. Let’s adjust that downward to 40 years to reflect the fact that people with a history of violent crime (shockingly) have a shorter life expectancy than average. Assuming they each committed exactly one murder, that would give us .0015% * 40 = 0.06%, or about 1 in 1667 people. The estimate should probably be a bit more conservative, because some people do commit multiple murders and others will end up in jail later for unrelated charges, so my best estimate would be that 1 in 2000 of your fellow community members is a successful murderer.  Plugging that 0.05% estimate into your formula with your estimate for the average number of people Americans meet each day, you get P(not a murderer) = .9995^26.2 = a 98.7% chance you didn’t walk past a murderer on any given day. At that rate, it will only take about 53 days before you passed your first murderer.

Ask New Question   Steven Cook Answered Dec 10, 2017 · Author has 612 answers and 396.7k answer views Lets try to put this number into perspective shall we. We should start by looking at the number of unsolved homicides in our local areas. You might be shocked to see just how many homicides go unsolved and the murderers are still at large. Look at the number of unsolved homicides and compare that to the local population. Math is not my strongest subject but that’s what the math would look like. I live in the State of Nevada and based on the numbers I was able to find there were 40 unsolved homicides in the year of 2016 alone. So that means there are up to 40 murderers still at large. Some of these cases may be linked to serial a serial killer. Nevada currently has a estimated population of about 2.94 million people, most Nevada residences live in Washoe County and Clark County. Nevada is also a hot spot for tourism we get around about number of 50 million people who visit Nevada every year. So it’s very possible that the murderers may have fled the state and went back home. So yes, it is totally possible to walk past a murderer on the streets and you would never know it. I’ve also been very interested in statistics like these. How many women do you walk by everyday who are struggling with drug addiction. These days you could be sitting on the bus next to a prostitute and you would never know it. They look just like everyone else. They no longer dress in skimpy clothes anymore unless they’re working at a brothel or a strip club. I live in the state of Nevada where these activities are legal, So it’s interesting to me to think about these numbers. it helps pass the time when you’re board. how many drug dealers to walk past when you’re at the airport. How many human trafficking victims do you walk past at the airport. It’s nearly impossible to know for the average individual. But when you look at the reported statistics it can help give you a better understanding. There is a estimated 20 to 30 million adults who are victims of human trafficking. These numbers are mind blowing because most people would never think about it when they’re stuck at a airport lounge or waiting in line at a greyhound bus station. 3.9k Views · View Upvoters   William Formby , PhD Criminal Justice & Higher Education, The University of Alabama (1981) Answered Mar 12, 2018 · Author has 1.4k answers and 1m answer views That of course depends on the indiidual.

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Paul Dezso deHolczer , I am a practicing attorney. Updated Jul 8, 2015 · Author has 2.1k answers and 1.7m answer views Assuming that this question addresses attorneys in the USA, the author of this question and its details has many misconceptions about what a defense attorney does and what is required of him or her.  These misconceptions are common and not a sign that the questioner is stupid or particularly ignorant. If a person is convicted of murder, his or her life is over. Why do lawyer need to be part of this?  Defense attorneys defend clients.  That is their job. Every accused person is presumed innocent until and unless one of two things happen: 1) a judge or jury finds that person is guilty after a trial; or, 2) the defendant knowingly and willingly waives the right to make the prosecutor prove guilt and informs the court that he or she is guilty of the crime with which he or she is charged. The prosecutor has the burden of proving a defendant is guilty.  That means that the prosecutor must prove the defendant is guilty in a court of law if the defendant determines to have a trial.  A defendant does not have the obligation of proving he or she is innocent of the charges.  The courts have even conceded that it is sometimes impossible for a person to prove that he or she is innocent. The defense attorney, on behalf of the defendant, has the right and the duty to make the prosecutor do a thorough job proving guilt. Let say if a lawyer give false evidence and things like that to get their clients out of the murder charge, is that unethical? This is absolutely unethical and forbidden. The lawyer can be punished for this both professionally and criminally. The defense attorney cannot ask or invite people ( even the defendant! ) to lie or misrepresent.  The defense attorney cannot ask or invite people ( except for the defendant! ) to withhold information from the prosecutor. [Does this] mean lawyers who handles murder cases are bad people? Absolutely not. There are and always will be some lawyers who are unethical. There are and always will be some people of whatever profession or occupation you care to name who are unethical. Incidentally, lawyers are citizens of their country and their communities. They have an interest not to see a murderer go free because that murderer could kill one of their friends or family.  Lawyers have to put those fears and concerns aside and do their best for the client.  That is their ethical obligation.  Being the attorney for an allegedly violent defendant does not shield an attorney from a violent act which might be committed by that allegedly violent defendant.  Historically, allegedly violent defendants have attacked and even killed their own defense attorneys.  One who represents an allegedly violent defendant to the best of his or her ability serves the public by fulfilling his or her obligations under our adversarial system. If the evidence is strong against a particular defendant, an attorney takes the case simply to save the defendant from capital punishment. 6.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

What happens if I tell my lawyer I killed someone and he tells the police? Ask New Question   Jennifer Ellis , I'm a lawyer in PA, USA. Nothing I write is legal advice. Updated Jul 20, 2015 · Author has 12.9k answers and 42.2m answer views As Paul Dezso deHolczer writes, the asker has some serious misconceptions about how the US legal system works, if that is the system he is asking about. First, you are assuming that there are no chances to fight or reduce the charge. If you are charged with first degree murder, in many states, you could be put to death. As a result, a lawyer could literally save your life. Or, could stop you from spending the rest of your life in prison. Second, a lawyer is necessary because our legal system requires two lawyers. One to represent the state and do all he can, within ethical bounds, to convict the accused; and one to do all he can, within ethical bounds, to help his client be found not guilty or to get his client the best deal possible. While I am sure there are lawyers who present false evidence, such lawyers are engaging in unethical behavior and could be disbarred for doing so. If a lawyer knows anyone will lie on the stand, even his client, he cannot put that person on the stand. If the client continues to insist on testifying, the lawyer will have to withdraw from the case. Many people think lawyers are unethical, but the truth is quite different. We are very ethical. We have to be. What lawyers do is work with the facts and witnesses they have. Laypeople often think cases are open and shut, but rarely is this the fact. As a result, laypeople think someone must have lied or done something wrong when someone they are convinced is guilty is found not guilty or is found guilty of a lesser crime. In the US, the prosecutor must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a very high standard to meet. And it is the job of the defense attorney to introduce reasonable doubt. He may do so by convincing the jury that witnesses made mistakes or are not credible. Or that there are other problems with the prosecution's case. There are often different views on what happened. All of this is relevant in terms of whether the accused will be convicted and if so, what he will be convicted of. Lawyers who handle criminal cases, even murder cases, are not bad people. I know many such attorneys and they are fine, upstanding people who care that the legal system is kept in check and that people have the constitutional protections to which they are entitled. Both innocent and guilty people are accorded these same rights in the US. 17.9k Views · View Upvoters If you require legal assistance, please contact a lawyer in yo...

Undo   Robert Jones Answered May 15, 2017 · Author has 65 answers and 17.9k answer views How can you already know someone is a murderer, without the proof? There are so many fallacies here… all up and down this page. Especially concerning “ethics”, such as Jennifer Ellis’ answer. I know there is something called a “legal ethics attorney”, but it’s strange, because they’re operating on something non-existent. It’s similar to “Constitutional Law”. Constitutional Law doesn’t really exist on an objective level. It exists, according to the interpretation of those who attempt to practice it. But these people have their own biases and beliefs, that don’t necessarily fit into the puzzle of objective complexity. Same goes for “knowing their clients are murderers”. How do they know, without evidence? That’s a far-fetched assumption. ———————————————————————————————————————- As an addon bonus, Jennifer Ellis asks what I do for a living so she can insult it…. Because I suppose she assumed my comment was an insult to her—which it was not. I was stating my opinion, and backing it up with a known fact; albeit, a fact not many are willing to subscribe to… But nevertheless, a fact. And her insults—along with anyone else’s—is more than welcome. I encourage criticism.. That’s how I learn. But this is how everyone learns. I’m not some alien, because I prefer constructive criticism and debating people with different opinions. But, she won’t allow me to comment back, even though she makes it seem as if she encourages it herself. In other words, she blocked me. So this is an appeal to the masses that makes it look as if I was shut down… But I am not shut down.. Here I am. WOW! And she blocked me because she didn’t feel like defending her bogus argument. But this is nothing new on Quora—or elsewhere—for that matter. I’m an autodidact of epistemology. I study, not exactly the objective truth, but the pursuit of objective truth. I study the methodologies of both knowing how to know, and knowing how to detect manipulations of fallacies, to which people claim to know. The latter is something I consider sophistry. The former, a complex, bottomless pit, that no doubt, isolates me from most people because I am not concerned with the social in-group biases of the mainstream herd. I don’t care what is/ what is not acceptable. I care about the truth… And on this mission, the truth is only available by a select, few instructions, to get there. And this runs back to the premise of this question. One can have an “instinct” or even an “intuition”, but this is a subjective analysis based on only the evidence you’re already familiar with. It’s a feedback loop of cognitive functioning that acts much like the “backfire effect”, in that you’ll want to believe what you already feel to be true, before actively getting out of the comfort zone to interrogate your beliefs, to a proportional degree as that which you claim to be true. 493 Views Quora User , Aspiring Lawyer Answered Nov 15, 2016 First off, I would like to point out that there is no situation where there is no chance to reduce the charge, because, for that to happen, he would have to be guilty before proven innocent , which is not the case. Yes lawyers, especially those in criminal defense, take cases in crimes in which they know that their client is guilty. This is not because they are heartless monsters that can't see reason like the rest of us, but because the constitution expressly states that everyone has the right to legal representation. Also, to answer your question about those lawyers being bad people, I could counter by saying that they are better people than any of us because while we condemn people as murderers without the facts, they seek the truth. 2k Views · View Upvoters   Justin Baker Answered Aug 20, 2016 Yes, attorneys who choose to defend people who are clearly guilty are absolutely bad people and deserve the same penalties the murderers they defend deserve, death. People are the absolute lowest of scum, other than the scum they willingly defend. I understand that people are presumed innocent until found guilty. But there are plenty of cases where it is known EXACTLY what happened and that the person is 100% guilty of a heinous and unforgivable crime. Jennifer and Paul both know this, but they couch there answers in legal and ethics BS to make themselves feel better, otherwise how would they sleep at night. They attempt to help rapists and murderers go free so they can hurt more people. No good human being can do that, regardless of what the “law” says the process should be. Ultimately it’s just extremely disgusting that there are people like Jennifer and Paul who actually think there is a justification for what they do. I guarantee they’ve never had to be face to face with the families of the victims of the scumbags they defend. Or maybe they have and just don’t care, which is another point that shows they are bad people. There is no excuse for what they do and good people like us can only hope that they will someday be put in prison the same as the criminals they defend, or that they eventually develop some actual human compassion and guilt and do the right thing by taking their own lives to atone for all the evil people they’ve defended and the terrible things they’ve allowed to continue happening. We can also hope that someday they or their families are victims of a terrible crime so that they can be on the other side and understand why us “ignorant and stupid” (Paul’s words) regular people, see them for the horrible, disgusting, bad people that they are. 1.2k Views · View Upvoters   Ken Dunham , Lawyer (Ottawa, Canada) Answered Nov 2, 2017 · Author has 1.9k answers and 448.7k answer views In many cases, we don’t k now that a person is guilty as charged until the evidence against them has been tested in court through the process of a fair trial. Part of the defence lawyer’s job is to ensure the accused gets a fair trial. The prosecution’s case is often not what everyone may assume it to be prior to the trial. Witnesses have yet to be tested through cross-examination. The defence has yet to present their evidence and arguments. The defence lawyer often doesn’t know what really happened. S/he wasn’t there. The accused may have a very different story to tell than the version being offered by the police / prosecution. Testimony from witnesses is often very different than that suggested by summaries in police reports. There are certainly cases where the evidence against the accused is overwhelming. But it’s still essential that we have a fair trial if the accused exercises his / her constitutional right to a trial. It’s not in anyone’s interest to convict people without a fair trial. Lawyers are prohibited (for legal and moral reasons) not to lead evidence that they know is false. For example, if an accused has already admitted to their lawyer that they were present at the scene of the crime, it would be improper for the lawyer to then call an alibi witness. As with any profession, some lawyers may act unethically on occasion, but most would tell the client that they’re not going to have anything to do with false evidence, and if the client persisted the lawyer would withdraw. A police officer once complained to me about the waste of time and money that is spent on trials for those who are “obviously guilty”. I asked him who decides who is already “obviously” guilty? In his world, that should be the job of the police. Take a moment to ponder the implications of the police deciding who gets a trial or not… 568 Views   Van Hayhow , Adjunct Faculty Member at New England Institute of Technology Answered Mar 9, 2018 · Author has 402 answers and 34k answer views I only write about US law, so please keep that in mind. That said, there are so many misconceptions in this short question it is mind boggling. First, how do we know that our client is a murderer? Because the police say so, the prosecutor says so? Since they are also human I think it is obvious that they can be wrong. Also, many prosecutors (not all) have a habit of knowing over charging so they can plea bargain down to the charge they think is really appropriate. I think this is unethical and many prosecutors agree as they don't do this. Let’s say we agree it is a homicide. Does that make it murder 1, murder 2, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter? Or maybe it is self-defense. I never handled a murder case, but I handled hundreds of criminal cases and there were many where I did not agree with the charge. And your idea that defending someone is somehow misleading the court is outright delusional. 56 Views · View Upvoters Related Questions How are divorce attorneys bad for a client?

And if you're a smoker, don't smoke near the body at all, your saliva can lead back to you, and then dig up a hole and put the burnt body inside the hole and the rest of your work will done by microorganisms. PRE-KILL Above was all easy, but before killing comes the stalking part. You got to record every minor detail about your target, i.e., their routine and it should cover all the details but do it from such a distance that your target remains clueless about you, sometimes you have to even care about their relatives and neighbors so none of them ever suspects you. And i think you should also get yourself informed about attack on which body part causes instant death or somethings like that. These points are all very hectic, thats why they say no murder is perfect, you will make mistake at some place P.S I'm not recommending anybody to kill someone, I'm totally against it and everyone should be. 33k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Vivek Shetti   Andrew Tinker Answered Feb 28, 2018 · Author has 1.1k answers and 418.9k answer views Originally Answered: How do you kill a person and not get caught? 1: You never talk about it with anyone, ever. Especially not somewhere where you have no control over who sees it, like an internet forum. By the way, Quora’s anonymous is pretty good. It’s not perfect. Did you invite anyone to answer this? If so, you aren’t anonymous. Even if you didn’t, it’s probably not police or three letter agency grade anonymous. 2: You make sure your victim isn’t anyone you’re connected to in any way. If the person you kill is anyone you’d have a reason to kill or to want dead, you’ll be a suspect. I know you’ve broken rule 1. Most likely you’re planning to break rule 2 as well. Most people need a motivation to kill, and that motivation is a big arrow pointing right at them.

Natural poisons are hard to trace. Hemlock or ricin would be almost impossible to trace unless they DNA sourced the plant to your back yard or someplace you left evidence. But if you had any interaction with the person, you would more than likely get caught. Your coworkers or friends or friends of friends would throw you under the bus or make up some story about you hating that particular person and make you a suspect. The perfect murder would be untraceable to you, meaning you couldn’t know the person. would be a complete stranger. There really isn’t a point to you murdering somebody at that rate.

Good question, I've been thinking about this a lot…. lol not because Ive been planning anything. The best way to do it, is actually very simple. (Hard, if you can't bring yourself to kill anyone). You want to choke/ break their neck. MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE there are no witnesses. And ABSOLUTELY do not bring anything that can be tracked. if you bring you phone or computer, you can easily be traced. However, they wouldn't think to trace you if you weren't connected to the victim. If you are a suspect, make sure you have a solid alibi. Put the body in a bag put it in your trunk. Burn the body to ashes, dump the ashes in a river. They will never find the body, so they aren't 100% sure it's a murder. the only way they could be 100% is if they catch your identit. Ways to conceal your identit include wearing gloves a mask (fingerprints, hair, and facial recognition). full body clothing (if they don't know the race, that's more of a variety of suspects). Smooth down the bottom of your boots (you don't have to). Do it at 3 am when no one is watching. The car, switch license plate just in case someone is looking. And please for the love of god, drive the best you ever have in your life, if you do get pulled over don't do anything that will give him reason to search your vehicle. Remain calm cooperate completely. Soo…. yeah when burning the body just dowse them in gasoline by a river that has a population of zero within at least a five mile radius. Then chuck it in the water.

Next, finish the job in a way that they can't get you caught, like puncturing a lung, so they can't scream. Use a weapon that you can either take with you, or that can take care of itself. Next, try you best to not be driven to insanity. Most murderers who get caught turn themselves in, even if the police would never have found them otherwise. Finally, hide the body. One of the most efficient ways is to freeze it, shatter it, and either bury it or send it into a river that flows to sea.

Distance: car bomb. A pipe bomb is easy to make and doesn't require any hard to source parts. Pay cash or use bogus paypal account. Get sent to drop address. Instructions readily available online. Up close: knife, sever the femoral artery. The person bleeds out in minutes. Change of clothes a necessary precaution. Can approach from behind or face on. Requires practice and confidence, plus rudimentary knowledge of anatomy. Up close: road ‘accident.’ Steal a car or van; if car aim for one with bull bars for maximum damage. Leave overnight in secure parking space. Same night steal matching vehicle plates. Next day hit-and-run victim at speed. Don't stop. Torch vehicle. The most preferable would be the last. You can disguise yourself with hat, glasses etc. Given the suddenness it’s unlikeky anyone would react, or even get a good description or be able to challenge. The death will probably be written off as accidental hit-and-run.

Second of all, DO NOT TELL ANYONE, don’t say that you’re thinking about it or stuff like that. If you want to have a partner in crime, make sure you can trust them, chances are that they’ll kill you after the deed has been done, orrr tell the police. Seriously though, make sure you plan it out, don’t be that one guy who screws everything up just because he’s been sitting there on his laptop for 5 minutes. Don’t post anything online about it before or after…duh. Make sure to remove allllll evidence. Maybe don’t kill the person in their house, maybe in a dark alley or somewhere isolated, you don’t want more people to kill. I’m not trying to encourage you to kill or anything, but if you want then make that decision yourself. I will say it again DO NOT TELL ANYONE.

Don't keep evidence on you… destroy articles of clothing, wash away any blood, dispose of murder weapon. If you have a strong motive that would lead police to suspect you, try to have an alibi or at least a story that can't be disproved through independent investigation- don't say that you were at a bar then have the police look through said bar's security camera footage and be able to prove that you weren't there.

You know what, The Mayo Clinic actually made this insinuation during one of my visits. It was during one of the many “leading” conversations that we had. The mere mention of “murder” gave me a serious amount of pause. The nurse working the scene was named Pat, from the East Coast, no doubt put up to the task to get me to “confess” that I’m some sort of murderer. She used the guise of menopause and stated that she felt like killing someone when she was going through menopause. I thought at the time, that’s your fucked up issue, why the fuck are you telling me something so fucking awefull. I WILL NOT CONFESS TO MURDEROUS THOUGHTS BECAUSE I’VE NEVER HAD THEM. The more that you press to make me out to be someone that I’m not the more you dig your own hole. Keep going I dare you. Afterthought: what triggered my written response here is that it was mentioned about “not getting caught”. Fuck you for thinking that I’m some sort of murderer instead of LOOKING at you own. I’m warning you. I will press charges before you make me out to be someone who I’m not. You little people have no idea what the pied piper is capable of and I don’t mean me. I mean THE PHYSICIANS.

Nowadays If you're just wanting to kill a random ststranger for a thrill, it's very possible to get away with it, but killing some unarmed helpless innocent just to think you're a bad ass is a bullshit punk way to get a kill so I'm not going to tell you how to go about it. If you are thinking about killing some bastard enemy who you figure deserves it, it's possible but doubtful you'll get away with it because of your connection to them. It's not like it was even 30 years ago. You're up aagainst some awesome technology, snitches are a dime a dozen, cameras are everywhere. I see no moral problem killing someone who deserves it, but I certainly wouldn't share my methods with anyone. You would be amazed at how many damn people in my life keep theirs because as the most likely primary suspect, I can't figure out a way to kill them and I'm not close enough friends with anyone who has the ability to kill that we could pull any trade killings. 482 Views · View Upvoters   Nir Harpaz , studied Game Design & Computer Programming Answered Feb 7, 2018 · Author has 94 answers and 28.7k answer views Originally Answered: What is the best way to kill a person without getting caught? dive the darknet, post a bounty and hope for good.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Killing  Murder  Statistics (collected data)  Human Behavior What, in general, is the percentage of people that kill another human being? War, murder, whatever. Update Cancel Answer Wiki 5 Answers   Jim Noblin , I know the distinctions between the Dark Personalities. Answered Oct 18, 2015 · Author has 932 answers and 1.6m answer views .       By far there are less than .06% of people in the USA who have ever murdered a fellow person. Murder Statistics By far about 8% of murderers have killed over 2/3rds of those known murdered in those cases that the perpetrator was caught. In other words most murderers have only have been known to have killed one person. And in truth there are a lot of murders never discovered by either the 1 time killer or the multiple murderer. In Stockholm alone at least 15% of 'runaways' are never knowingly seen again. My thinking is the vast majority are in a disposal site where they are unlikely ever to be discovered again. In war, even with intensive training and propaganda less than 26% of riflemen even fire at an enemy. 2% of infantryman kill or wound 95% of bullet caused causalities. By far the unseeing bomber and artilleryman have far higher kill rates per person involved. And I have been unable to find a reliable source for that, but that is what infantrymen think (know). 19.4k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question   Jack Noel , Retired executive Answered Jul 10, 2017 · Author has 6.8k answers and 4.2m answer views World War Two killed more civilians and military personnel than any war in history. That amounted to only about 3% of the world population at the time. That number was replaced and more within 2 or 3 years after the war. In states where records are kept, the percentage of people who are licensed to carry a concealed gun are only 20% as likely at the general population to murder someone. But if you break out the number of actual criminals from the general population, the general population’s murder rate drops nearly to that of the gun-carrying population. So even when guns (the best murder tool there is) are available, the great majority of people do not commit murders. The percentage of people who will murder someone is very very small. 4.2k Views   Jonathan Mayshar Answered Feb 7, 2018 · Author has 285 answers and 55.6k answer views If you believe in the legal principle that a person who suborns killing (hiring a hit-man, for example) is a killer, and if you are including war in the statistic that you are seeking, then your percentage includes every voting member of a democracy that participates in war. If you believe in the philosophical principle that a person who passively allows someone to be killed, when intercession would cause them no risk, is a killer, then you should also include everyone eligible to vote in a democracy.

The accuracy of the claims cannot be independently verified.  Reddit users have gathered together online to reveal their startling personal connections to some of the world's most notorious and prolific murderers or serial killers.  If taken as read, the anecdotal discussion - which cannot be confirmed - could provide a useful and revealing insight into the emotional aftershock experienced by the families and friends of those who kill.  Titled: 'People who have known murderers, serial killers, etc. How did you react when you found out? How did it effect [sic] your life afterwards?', the thread has had more than 6,000 responses.   Read more   Daughters of notorious serial killers discuss their experiences on TV  Think hard before you retweet: Trump learns his lesson the hard way  Appalled by the fuss over human rights for serial killers? Try Dubai    Some mention the infamous kidnapper and rapist Ted Bundy, Colorado movie theatre gunman James Holmes and 'American Sniper' killer Eddie Ray Routh, while others talk of childhood friends or classmates who are arguably less well-known, but were once at the centre - or cause - of similar tragedy.  One comment, which is rated top of the thread, details the murder of a girl by his sister's ex-boyfriend.  "My sisters ex-boyfriend is in jail currently for killing his next girlfriend and putting her body into a cement-sealed barrel," he writes, astoundingly.  "It's so awful for that girl and her family, but all I could think is what a sucidal revenge mission I would be on if it had happened to my sister. It still keeps me up at night."  Another user claims to have known the Colorado movie massacre gunman James Holmes , 27, who killed 12 people and injured 70 others in 2012.  He was convicted of first-degree murder and 140 counts of attempted first degree murder for the shooting at a packed midnight screening of a Batman film at a multiplex in the Denver suburb of Aurora.  Police found a weapons arsenal at the home of James Holmes  The Reddit contributor says that she knew Holmes - who was handed life sentences for each fatality and given a maximum 3, 318 years in prison - in college.  "I remember him being super paranoid," she writes. "I remember filling out health questionnaires/medical clearance forms for a final that required in vivo work and access to the vivarium.  "He threw a fit in our lab, telling our TA he wasn't going to fill it out. He finally did, but put a disclaimer on the bottom of it. It was bizarre. I think that was around 08/09, I think he was already unraveling then."  She also says that she remembers the moment she first found out what had happened in Aurora. "I was working when my old college roommate text me asking if I heard about the shooting in Colorado followed shortly by her texting me who did it.  "I remember feeling scared for some reason when I put the name to a face. My teeth started chattering wildly. I was shocked.  "It still freaks me out to this day remembering working in labs, and having class discussions with that guy.  "We were definitely not friends but, I probably saw him nearly every day for at least a couple years. I can still see him working across from me under a fume hood in my minds eye anytime his name is brought up."    He never seemed to make eye contact with anyone    A Reddit user recalls going to college with James Holmes    The comments in response to her post are just as interesting - and contain similarly personal links to the tragedy.  One Redditor says: "One of my classmates was shot in the head at that shooting. It's interesting to hear from someone who knew him before that time."  To which the original poster adds: "The only other thing that I remember was that he never seemed to make eye contact with anyone. Totally thought that was just an introvert thing, but still odd."  And others have comparable links to some of the world's most notorious criminals - including Ted Bundy , the prolific serial killer who confessed to murdering at least 30 young women in the 1970s, including 12-year-old Kimberly Leach.  Ted Bundy's 12 year old victim Kimberly Leach  "Ted Bundy dated my aunt," one person writes, astonishingly. "I grew up in Kirkland, Washington - which is right outside of Seattle. My aunt lived in Ballard at the time.  "They dated for a few months and it just sort of fell apart. She said that he was one of the most polite, nicest people that she had ever met."  The author's post prompts an outpouring of anecdotes.  "When Ted Bundy was in prison (in Florida, I think?) his favorite reporter to speak with was my cousin," one writes. "She still has the Christmas card he sent her one year."  But, the user adds: "They had a falling out while he was on death row, and I think he sent her death threats."  Bundy's case, which was documented in an eponymous film directed and co-written by Matthew Bright in 2002, is not the only one of its kind to have been immortalised on screen in recent years.  One Redditor describes being deployed with former US Marine Eddie Ray Routh - subject of the film 'American Sniper'.  He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole in February for shooting and killing soldier Chris Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, at a Texas gun range in 2013.  Lawyers for Eddie Ray Routh have said he was insane and is not guilty of murder  "I deployed with Eddie Ray Routh, who later went on to kill Chris Kyle (AKA American Sniper)," he writes.  "The talk about him made me abundantly aware of the fact that all veterans have a tough time getting help with their mental health after we come back.  "Combat veterans face social pressure to "man up," but noncombat veterans get that plus accusations that they're lying because people think only combat can cause PTSD."  The soldier, while not excusing what Routh did, goes on to describe the kind of trauma experienced by veterans in places like Haiti, to which end, he says, he "still can't eat mango without running the risk of uncontrollably sobbing because the taste instantly reminds me of what it was like". Routh, he claims, was there with him.  "One bite, and I feel the humidity," he writes evocatively. "I smell the burning garbage and the pig s**t from the two feral pigs that we accidentally fenced into our camp.  "I see refugee camps with people living in tents made of their own clothes, holding signs that say "America Help".  "I'm THERE again, and I never saw combat. But try telling that to 90% of post-9/11 veterans, and the response is "Bulls**t you f*****g pussy, you didn't even go to Iraq.""    Routh was there in Haiti with me    Unidentified US soldier recalls being deployed overseas with Eddie Ray Routh    Others recall chilling connections to killers in their childhoods - before they went on to commit heinous acts of violence.  "In grade school I sat next to this guy named George," someone writes. "Super quiet kid, and occasionally I would go over his house after school. His mom would occasionally be our substitute teacher.  "Fast forward to when I am in college and go to pick up a NY Post in the morning. I see the headline "THREE STRIKES, SHE'S OUT ... KID BEATS MOM TO DEATH WITH BASEBALL BAT". And there was a photo of George and his mom."

He was jailed for life in March 2008, when he was 32, after he was found guilty of four counts of murder along with attempting to kill another woman at Leeds General Infirmary and the city's St James's Hospital.

Detectives said he showed no remorse and he has always protested his innocence and denied injecting patients with insulin.   PA     2/5  Benjamin Green   In 2006 Geen, who was then 25, was given 17 life sentences after he was found guilty of murdering two of his patients and attacking 15 others.

His trial heard that Geen gave them injections of drugs such as muscle relaxants, insulin and sedatives to stop them breathing while working at the Horton Hospital in Banbury, Oxfordshire.

The court also heard of his thrill at attempting to revive these patients.   pa     3/5  Anne Grigg-Booth   The 52-year-old was found dead at home after taking a drug overdose in 2005, eight months before she was due to go on trial accused of murdering three elderly women at Airedale General Hospital, near Keighley, and the attempted murder of a middle-aged man.

She had worked at the hospital for 25 years and was also facing 13 counts of unlawfully administering poison to 12 other patients.

The charges related to her injecting patients with high doses of painkilling drugs such as morphine and diamorphine while she worked on the night shift.   PA     4/5  Harold Shipman   Dr Harold Shipman, one of the most prolific serial killers the UK has known, was convicted at Preston Crown Court in 2000 of the murder of 15 of his patients while he was a general practitioner in Hyde, near Manchester.
Police also investigated allegations that he might have murdered many more patients while he was working in Hyde, Todmorden and Pontefract.
A major inquiry into his activities concluded the doctor killed about 250 patients between 1971 and 1998.   PA     5/5  Victorino Chua   Victorino Chua was found guilty of murdering two patients and poisoning 19 others at the Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport. 
He killed and poisoned his victims using insulin.
He wrote a 13-page letter discovered by police that stated: "They thought I'm a nice person but there a devil in me. I know if I go, I go straight to hell no question ask."   Rex Features        Some reveal how they cannot even begin to understand what motivates people they once knew to 'snap'.  "I went to school with a popular guy, on the pro athlete team, but always kept to himself," a Redditor says. "He seemed to only interact with others when he was playing with his teammates. But he wasn't awkwardly quiet or anything.  "But then he was on the news for killing his gf, gf's mom, and little sister (minor). Police found him walking down the street with blood all over him.  "It just seems weird because you know this person and it makes you wonder what made them react to that extent."    You wonder what made them react to that extent    A contributor recalls going to school with someone who went on to murder his girlfriend and her family    And there are even some users who talk about deaths as family legend.  "One day I was working on a family tree, and I'm quizzing my mom about different names and connections and stuff," a user writes.  "Then out of nowhere she tosses out, "And then there was old Aunt Tillie, who strangled a little boy in her living room."  Another says: "I found when I was like 13 that both my grandfather and uncle had killed. I never met either of them.  "My uncle killed 2 people. The first one he stabbed a guy like 80 times, slit his throat ear to ear and then cut him from b***s to throat.  "He wrote on the walls with the guys blood, kinda Charles Manson like. The second person was a woman he met at the bar. He stabbed her around 70 times and dismembered her."  Others describe what it's like to work with people who have committed murder.

That seems very high, so my question is how likely is an average person to walk past any murderers in their life and how many?   7 comments share save hide report all 7 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion? Post a comment! Create an account [–] chilaxinman 15✓  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (4 children) Since you asked for the average, that is what I am aiming for. The UNODC says that the international homicide rate is 6.6 murders per 100,000 people. To account for serial killers and mass murderers (which that study shows are pretty negligible), we'll just say that the international murderer:general population ratio is 6:100,000.  The UN also says that the international average life span is 71 years old, so that is what I'll use.  This is where it gets murky. How do you define how many individuals the average person walks by in their lives? Well, I am not somebody who tends to go where I'm going to meet new people all the time, and I estimate that I walk by probably about 10 new people on average every day. I imagine that this would put me towards the low end of this scale, but we just need starting point.  10 new people per day * 365 days per year * 71 years of living = about 260,000 separate individuals somebody might walk by. 260,000 people in a lifetime * 6 murderers per 100,000 people = 15.6 or about 16 murderers .  Say somebody lives in a big city where they get out all the time and walk by 1000 new people per day. You just multiply the 16 murderers by the factor 1000/10=100 to get 1600 murderers in a lifetime.  This is the international average. Every place and culture has some variation of number of murderers to the general population, so your location will have a lot to do with the number of murderers you encounter throughout your life. I also did not account for murderers that are caught and removed from the general population. The little bit of research I did into that showed a pretty high rate of unsolved murders in the US, but I couldn't find an international assessment.  This also all assumes that murderers are normal people that do normal people things and also have murdered somebody. I make the assumption that most murderers don't close themselves off from the rest of the world, although that is entirely possible.  Either way, it seems like walking past about 36 murderers throughout your lifetime is not an outlandish estimate.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Humeon [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child)  ✓   This is fantastic, thanks :)   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] checks_for_checks ＢＥＥＰ ＢＯＯＰ  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Did you mean to award a request point for another user's math?

Prison guard?  Pretty sure you will throw off the curve!  Haha.  If we want to take a small scale sample, you could look at NYC .  They don't separate murder from other violent crime such as rape, but that article cites 230 released in 2012.  If you follow the increasing trend, that is probably growing year over year.  So if you just calculate the chance of walking past one of those....lets say....300 people for 2013, you just take the figure of 8.406 million residents in NYC and see how that fits in with those 300 specific people.  That's a chance of 1 in 28,000 that you will cross their path.  Do we take this as that 1 in 28k chance per day?  Per month?  That's where it gets fuzzy.  Also, this only speaks to you crossing paths with one of the people released that year.  Not the ones who were released in prior years, or those who have never been caught for the murder they committed.  EDIT:  Really, if you want to play it safe, move to New Hampshire.  Louisiana scares me with their murder rates...   permalink embed save give gold about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

I never had a great feeling about him, but I was also so young that even if I had said something, nobody would've cared. He never really did anything to me, just seemed creepy.  One day, he asked my mom to come over. I don't remember the justification for it, but she said no because she ended up having to do an emergency tooth extraction that day.  A couple days later, he knocked on the door. For some reason, my mom didn't answer the door (I don't know where I was). He eventually left... And then killed four other people, one being a member of our church. He also killed someone while in prison, about 10+ years later.  It really shook the town when it happened, and reopened old wounds when his face was in the news again, especially last year, when he killed himself.   permalink embed save give gold [–] c0neyisland  100 points 101 points 102 points  1 year ago  (30 children) That is so scary.

He had no conscience and was simply anti-social in every respect. He was also incredibly violent. Everyone knew this kid was going to be a danger. Just as he graduated (he was a year older than me) he tried to steal gas from a gas station and when the elderly attendant went to stop him, he beat the man within an inch of his life. He took-off and began a campaign of harassment against the family. He was arrested for terrorizing, criminal threatening and witness intimidation, but wound-up getting much of the charges reduced. He was working with a social worker when he killed someone. He spent more than a decade in jail and was recently re-arrested for cheque forgery and mail fraud. He's serving a 5 year stint. The guy is absolutely frightening and honestly he just gives you the sense he'd kill you for no reason.   permalink embed save [–] GodDamnYou_Bernice [ S ]  182 points 183 points 184 points  1 year ago  (5 children) Shit like this scares me.

We didn't interact much with him, he was married with two kids, had a good job. His wife had no idea what was going on. The FBI profiled him out fairly well although I wanna say they thought it was a single, non-family man because that's your typical "serial killer." But they were able to figure out what sort of demeanor he would have towards his potential victims and this is what caused the police to want to survey him.  It's very interesting how he was caught - I'm shocked it hasn't been a forensic files, actually.  My mom worked with his son, and he is a wonderful young man. He didn't change his last name, although I probably would have because everyone knows who is dad is.  My mom also was friends with one of his victims. And there are a handful of other women he most likely killed but their bodies weren't found (or he'd gotten smart and started cleaning up after himself, so to speak.)  Of note, he didn't rape any of his victims although he did target sex workers. Most serial killers in his category (Ted Bundy, Green River Killer, et al.) sexually abused their victims. But his killing was based on rage, per all experts. A friend who knew his entire family says that he was more of a Norman Bates type because every woman he killed was actually a substitute for killing his overbearing, dominating mother.  But yeah, everyone who actually knew Steve has little to say about HIM; rather, everything is about his family. He was so nondescript, in the background, not much of a personality.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Peemster99  54 points 55 points 56 points  1 year ago  (1 child) I'm pretty sure an old friend of mine was a relative of his.

But anyway, when the cops realized that there was a serial killer roaming about a certain stretch of highway, preying on sex workers, they called in the feds to help. One of the things that the FBI did was, like in Criminal Minds, create a profile of the killer.  Meanwhile, women were being murdered and left in broad daylight. One of the women had blue carpet fibers on her.  It was decided that a female police officer would pose as a prostitute and would bear in mind the FBI profile. One potential "john" was driving a panel van with blue carpeting; additionally, he fit the profile. The officer, while talking to him, collected a sample of the blue carpet.  Everyone knew it was him, but there wasn't probably cause for a search warrant or anything. His van was bugged for the purpose of surveillance. The law enforcement was hoping that he would do something illegal while driving so he could at least be pulled over if his recordings didn't incriminate him. Meanwhile, they were watching him, listening to him. Well, he found the recording mechanism and destroyed it. There went THAT.  Also meanwhile, it was leaked to the public that the blue carpet fibers were the key.  The next woman that turned up dead was floating in the canal. The blue fibers were washed off. He knew they knew.  The cops had him on very close surveillance and were just waiting for him to run a stop sign or speed or SOMETHING. It wasn't happening. They even witnessed a young adult woman get into his van. She was never seen again but she got in willingly so their hands were tied.  Eventually, I believe he didn't signal while changing lanes or something. But they got him, they detained him....he was convicted but just barely because the defense attempted to throw out the blue carpet fibers. They ended up finding him guilty of two of the murders rather than the 5+ he committed. At one point he represented himself.  But once the death penalty was announced, he didn't pursue any appeals at all. He didn't want to embarrass his family. He was executed less than five months later, the first person executed in Delaware since execution became legal again in the 70s.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] heinous_anus-  5 points 6 points 7 points  1 year ago  (1 child) This sounds like a Criminal Minds episode.   permalink embed save parent give gold load more comments (1 reply) [–] spiderlanewales  526 0 Answer Link 525 points 526 points 527 points  1 year ago  (60 children) Used to hang out/party with this dude, Kyle.

He is currently in jail for life, no parole. He killed a kid, stole his bank cards and car, and drove the kid's car around with the dead body in the trunk for a week before he was arrested.

They were all family members. It's a complicated story but I do not blame him for what he did. He saw someone hurting his step-daughter and put an end to it, though violently.  Uncle was a nice guy. He had friends and family that all loved him. He had a temper, yes, but he could control himself. He had just had open heart surgery and was told he had months left. He took it upon himself to fix a problem and he did that by killing people.  He talked to everyone calmly and explained the situation after it happened, called his wife to apologize and say bye and don't come home, and then went home and blew his brains out.  I never expected it. No one did. It seemed random but he had obviously planned it, mostly. It's just, kinda crazy afterwards because people that didn't know him would say such terrible things. But he was a really nice guy and I miss him.   permalink embed save give gold [–] lawfulmario  75 points 76 points 77 points  1 year ago  (27 children) ...any other details?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] SweetLittleButtercup  318 points 319 points 320 points  1 year ago  (26 children) Basically, his step-daughter married an abusive guy and uncle and his wife were told they'd never see their grandson again. My aunt was devastated as she lost both her daughter and grandchild due to this controlling dude. My uncle decided to do something about it.  Aunt went to work and uncle walked over to daughters house. Her husband answered the door and saw the pistol, so he tried to take it. There was quite a struggle in the kitchen and the gun went off... Striking daughter in the head. She somehow walked all the way down the hall and into her bedroom, shut the door and fell against it, dead.  Struggle continues in the kitchen while grandson is in a pack-n-play in the living room. Uncle finally gets the gun enough to point and shoot son-in-law, in the eye. He drops, but is still alive. Uncle leaves him bleeding out on the floor with the gun and goes to get his grandson. Walks through the kitchen and out the backdoor.  Uncle goes over to his mother-in-laws, because they all live in the same neighborhood, and hands her the baby explaining that his parents are dead a she's going home to kill himself. Walks off. She doesn't believe him and rushes to her granddaughters home, to find them and call 911.  Uncle gets home and calls his wife at work. Apologizes and explains that he never meant for her daughter to get hurt. He tells her not to come home and that he loves her. Hangs up. Proceeds to sit down in the living room against the couch with a shotgun and blows his head off after calling the cops and telling them to come get him.  Aunt calls 911 and rushes home. Her mother didn't get to the house before he killed himself either. It's all over within an hour. One of the worst things that's ever happened in this county, and all I can think is there's no way that my uncle would have done that. He loved his daughter. He never would have hurt her, he was trying to protect her. I assume that's why he killed himself because he wasn't a big believer in that.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] truckbot101  93 points 94 points 95 points  1 year ago  (24 children) Holy shit.

See, grandson wasn't actually abusive dudes kid. His name was on the birth certificate but he knew it wasn't his child. When he died, his family fought my aunt for custody because they tried to make her out to be a bad person for having been married to a murderer.  She fought in court and had to prove that the grandson was her blood and not theirs. Eventually his family stopped fighting. Obviously, it probably had a lot to do with life insurance money and everything too, so, yeah.  He was about a year old when it happened. Doesn't remember a thing. Bonus.  Then it gets fucking worse. See, kid was from a one-night stand. The baby daddy didn't even drop a name, so no idea of genetics... Which became a big deal when he started having seizures near constantly. He still does. Nothing works. It will eventually kill him.  He's just a fucking kid. He doesn't deserve this shitty life.

Her mom was a huge support for her but passed a few years back. Her husbands family has nothing to do with her and her family is iffy at best. She has home care workers and neighbors that are amazingly helpful though.  And, strangely enough, lots of people want something to do with them simply because of the murders. I guess it's some sort of curiosity, something. I'm sure a lot of people know about the money too, seeing as how her family already had quite a bit due to her father dying on the operating table and them suing the hospital for several million decades ago. Don't think there's much of anything left by now, with any of it.  But she's a fairly kind person. She gives whatever she can to help others. She complains but doesn't burden people with her problems.

I even hooked up with him once (cringe).  Found out later he kidnapped a woman, killed her, and left her body in the mountains.

One guy thought he was going to get off on probation. Apparently his wife came at him with a knife, but he took the knife away from her and stabbed her, but was claiming it was self defense. We tried telling him it wasn't self defense because he had the knife and not her when he stabbed her to death. He was really in denial.  Second, my cell mate was there for attempted murder. And we had a kiosk where you could type in your inmate number to order things off canteen, view your charges, view your next court dates, etc.  He and I were at the kiosk and he viewed his charges and the attempted murder charge turned to murder. Than the man he tried to kill ended up dying in the hospital. I looked at him and he just looked at the screen for a couple moments. No emotion, just a cold blank stare.  It was like I was looking at him looking over the dead body and realizing he was going to prison for the rest of his life. And he had no emotion towards any of it. He just logged out and said i could log on and walked back to our cell.

Once that knife entered into his possession though and he used it he was then using excessive force.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] StaySwoleMrshmllwMan  114 points 115 points 116 points  1 year ago  (13 children) The problem is I don't think anyone thinks like that in the heat of the moment.

He was actually the reason as to why nobody messed with me. He was Hispanic and in the Latin Kings and originally from New York City. He knew the moment he met me that I was Italian and was from the NY/NJ area. He told me Italians and Hispanics stick together up there. He introduced me to the top dogs in that pod and I fit right in.  I did ask him when we were in our cell if he wanted to talk about it. But told him to be careful because as far as he is concerned I could be a rat and tell the cops information to use against him in order to get off on my charges. Told him he shouldn't talk to anybody but his lawyer about the case. He agreed.  But I didn't feel unsafe being locked in a cell with the guy. Was comfortable in a cell with him.

He, the son, was kind of weird and kept to himself a lot, probably because people were always asking him about his dad.  He never really said much about it, said he wasn't allowed to speak of it, but he had opened up to one or two dudes.  He said his dad was just a completely normal dad.  Apparently his dad killed a few people before he was born, then stopped killing when the kids were born, but after the kids left the house he got bored.  He started taunting police with letters and emails about how they would never catch him, well, they did.  He had a shed out back with all of his trophies still.  The FBI came to interview the son while he was in sub school in the navy, and until that moment, nothing like this had ever entered the sons mind about his dad.  Another guy I worked with, kind of, came home from a deployment to find that his wife had given up on the kids, locked them in their rooms, and just sat on the couch playing final fantasy vii.  On child was old enough to survive by drinking water from the toilet, the other, was just a small baby, and didn't last long.  The baby was found wrapped in plastic, and in the closet.  The guy had sex with his wife first before reporting it in the morning.  He was short, quiet, and just one of those guys with like zero confidence, and his wife was a good three hundred plus.  I had two high school friends also committed, or tried to, murders, one, was a popular girl who hid a pregnancy.  She had the baby in a bathroom, slit its throat, then left it in the trash.  I can't remember how the authorities got called, but they found the baby alive, and she went to jail.  Another buddy of mine set up a guy in a drug buy, then robbed him.  They pushed his body and his truck into a lake.  He went to jail.  This guy was super funny, and pretty popular. We were both in like a gangsta phase at the time we were friends, I guess he just never grew out of his.

He was a few years older, and in college at time, but all of the seniors on our team pretty much immediately assumed that Chris did it the second we heard his parents were attacked at practice. We found out before it was announced on the news because a few swimmers drove down his rode to get to our morning practices before school, they were questioned if they saw anything unusual since they would have been passing by not long after the attack. They never implied or suggested that it was Chris or that he was a suspect, he was just the kind of kid where we immediately thought it was him the second we heard something like that happened.  Chris was the kind of fucked up sociopath who always had to have his hazing reigned in by the other seniors when he was on our team. He was the kind of kid who thought he was hot shit and always took things too far. He was also really good at pulling the wool over adults eyes and presenting himself as "such a good kid."

One night, he stabs his roommate to death, breaks the knife off into his skull, and begins a stand-off with police after the roommate doesn't come into work the next day and his boss visits the house and finds his body (roommate worked at a business directly next door to the house). After a few hours he ends up blowing his brains out. Turns out, a girl he was seeing was fucking his roommate for spare drugs. He took a shitload of steroids and acid along with an eight-ball of coke and went nuts, killing the dude in his sleep.  That aside, it made me terribly sad. I had just seen him the night before when my buddy bought weed off of him. It was totally shocking and a huge deal in my small town. Everybody started asking me about him and eventually I just learned to dodge the question. Because to me he was a good kid that I grew up with and had great nights with and did a shitload of drugs with. To everybody else, he was a psycho.   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  25 points 26 points 27 points  1 year ago  (0 children) To be fair, it's possible to think fondly of someone who did something horrific.

Not that long ago, two months actually, old friend stabbed his mate in the chest, twice and went to bed. His roommate found the corpse in the morning and apparently, the killer just didn't react at all. He knew he had killed him but nothing. That was already second person he killed, first one was a drink driving accident (to my eyes and all of our friends; it was a kill, not an accident so we haven't had really any interaction with him for years). It messed him up pretty badly but the recent stuff is just.. One of those that should not be leaving prison as i know it is not going to tend here.. He has tried to slowly poison himself to death with booze and speed, apparently it has destroyed his "soul". Not a bad person, quite warm and almost cuddly, caring and empathetic... when sober. I even saw him few hours earlier, he lived nearby and we used the same grocery store. He tried to initiate conversation but i had no time nor really and motivation, i was always friendly with him, as is my nature. There is this lingering thought that since we were once in quite similar life situation, i got out of it and got clean, i look allright, healthy and "frisk". Maybe that interaction caused something, i dont know but i surely will not think it is in anyway my fault even if that did cause something to snap.  Most likely, it was about some bottle of wine two weeks earlier, combined with some amount of drugs one or the other had consumed at some point during that bender that lasted at least two years, non stop.. Some stupid prolonged argument between two addicts that don't really like each other but are forced to "work" together.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] SweetLittleButtercup  16 points 17 points 18 points  1 year ago  (1 child) That last sentence is so true.

We both immigrated in Canada 17 years ago (when we were 10) and even though we had trouble communicating, we still became good friends by playing games with other immigrant kids. After 3 years, him and his family moved to Hamilton, but we still remained in touch after all those years.  Any time I'd visit friends in Toronto I would drop by Hamilton and visit him. He was involved in some shady stuff such as dealing drugs so he had a ton of money. He would pay everything while I was there (Casinos, Hotels, Alcohol, etc.) and was really a good friend.  Then today, our other friend who grew up with us (who still lives in the same city) came to meet me at a park and told me the news about his involvement. I thought that it was a joke, but soon found out that it wasn't.  It's 5 a.m now and I have trouble sleeping since this is shocking news to me. We both escaped from our country to get away from war and he ends up shooting and killing someone.  I can't imagine how his family are dealing with this. His mother is a sweetheart and always made sure my stomach was full when I visited them.  I always expected him to end up in jail for maybe getting caught dealing drugs, but never expected him to be involved in a murder :/   permalink embed save give gold load more comments (3 replies) [–] [deleted]  51 points 52 points 53 points  1 year ago *  (4 children) I grew up with two killers. One was a serial killer. His name is Bobby Fry . He slept at my house and me his. My wife dated him in high school. When we were 17 he was accused of raping a girl in our social circle sister at a party one night. No one believed it. Yeah were we wrong. He had a bit of a temper but to be honest I never saw it coming. Just a couple of days before he was finally arrested (he was caught when his car got stuck trying to bury a body) I got into a pretty heated argument with him. I often wonder how close I was to being a victim. He nearly beheaded a couple of his victims. There's a lot more to the story like the fact I do not think he and the guy convicted of helping him acted alone. There was a clique back then that was almost occult like around the people he hung out  with. A clique with one leader. But I digress. Anyways he was convicted of killing 4 however they're (police) pretty sure that count is much higher. I know there is an unsolved murder where we grew up, and it was 2 blocks from where he lived.  The second was my very first roommate. He wound up being a killer for hire. I knew he was crazy (his older brother was killed when we were 15 in a drunk driving accident) but I never thought that crazy. He is currently serving life without parole. I would link his inmate profile but I do not know if that would violate reddits rules of doxxing. Anyways that's the two I grew up with.   permalink embed save [–] valleyoftheballs  54 points 55 points 56 points  1 year ago  (3 children) I hope you found that girl and apologized for not believing her.

My step brother. I had known him since I was 15. He was my favorite of my 2 step brothers and we were really pretty close. He had been in jail a few times for other offenses, but for the past few years had been doing really well and had an amazingly sweet girlfriend.  And one day my mom calls me to tell me that the evening before, he had shot and killed her in their (stepbro and girlfriend's) driveway.  I never would have imagined it from him. I was in complete shock. I have reached out to him a couple times through the years, curious as to what the hell went through his head... but he's never bothered to reply.   permalink embed save give gold [–] 11bulletcatcher  22 points 23 points 24 points  1 year ago *  (1 child) I've known three murderera, all equally heinous.  The first two, Mike and Simon, were kids I played football with all the way into high school. Now, I dropped out junior year and joined the Army in what would have been the end of my senior year. After basic training,  I looked up my local paper, the Sarasota Herald Tribune, and find out that these two had been arrested and convicted of murder. Apparently, they had crashed the birthday party of a wrestler for our rival school, gotten kicked out, returned with a posse, busted out the kid's windows which initiated a party brawl on the lawn; the two of them ganged up on bday boy, beat him with a bat and kicked him until he drowned internally from his own blood.  The other  was in the Army as well; we had a new private named Andrew Norwine at Ft. Polk. He was a pussy and a pushover, awkward and nerdy, but he didn't seem a bad guy. I was a specialist at the time, and I saw him struggling, so I'd try to give him some support. My squad leader even had him over to play D&D 2.0 with us. He was the shittiest, most unlucky elven archer of all time. Anyhow, he had been an acid tripper and shroom fiend before the Army, and he went AWOL and fell into his old habits. He returned, was article 15'd  newly friendless and having alienated his fellow soldiers. One dude even got drunk one night and pissed on his mattress while he was out. It wasn't long before he ran away again. Only, this time was his last. He eventually turned back up a second time. Not too long after, he was picked up one night by MP's at our BN Staff Duty desk and extradited to Texas.  See, apparently he had a rendezvous with a mannish Mexican woman and some white dude. I assume drugs, but I'm not sure. Anyhow, my understanding of what happened is this:  The trio attempted to extort a mentally handicapped man named Ronnie Gammage. He wrote them a check. The next day they attempted to cash the check, but it was rejected for lack of funds. At some point, they located Gammages car, and slashed a tire. When he came out they offered to take him to a tire shop. They pulled over after driving a bit and beat the shit out of him, then abducted him again due to the public nature of their location. They went somewhere more remote and my understanding is that his throat was sliced, body burned, and hidden out of sight.  They were all caught due to the earlier attempt at cashing the check.  https://gonebutnotforgotten.wordpress.com/2008/08/02/2-arrested-in-beating-death-of-sarasota-high-student/  http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/220879/norwine-pleads-guilty-sentenced-to-life-for-murder-of-longview-man   permalink embed save give gold load more comments (1 reply) [–] quackquackquirk  21 points 22 points 23 points  1 year ago  (1 child) Office mate of mine killed his new wife, attempted suicide.

I only knew the mate I showed up with and the guy throwing the party, so meeting new people was a requirement. There were upwards of 60 people at this thing, so no reason to not mingle.  A few dudes were in that 'rumbling' mood where they have a good natured fight (just grappling, no punching) or do something similar to test each other. I'm down for that, so I gravitate towards that area of the party. Can't quite remember how the next part started, but I ended up arm-wrestling a dude who had those stereotypical 'crazy eyes', wide-open like he's super intense about everything. I usually counter intensity with good-natured goofiness so when I beat the guy and he seemed super pissed with himself and everyone who saw it I just told him that everything was cool, good match, let's booze on. Didn't think much of it except I had the vibe that the guy wouldn't be able to take a joke over it.  Twice more that night the dude came and found me and demanded rematches, to which I was happy to do since I was well happy in my increasingly drunken state. Both times I beat him and both times he was pissed. After the third I said that that was it for the night, and figured that that was the end of it.  Later that night though, when the party had largely cleared out and it was something like 3am, I went out the front and came upon him and three other guys organising some sort of "mutual punch" thing. The gist behind it (I learnt later) was that crazy eyes hated this particular guy he was going to punch, and this was the only way he could get to do it without looking like he was picking on the guy (bro social rules are interesting).  Unwitting victim guy takes his free swing and crazy eyes and his mates laugh it off for being weak, than crazy eyes sets up for his shot, except unlike UVG he is four steps back and winding up like a javeline thrower. I'm not down for that so I get between them and tell crazy-eyes that you can't take a running punch in response to a standing one, which gets me a look from him but at this point I've been nothing but a good dude to him over the arm-wrestling defeats so he stands down. He still smacks the shit out of UVG with his normal standing punch, but it was 'fair' at least.  All in all, the guy was just giving off a bad vibe all night and was memorable for it.  I later hear from the mate I went to the party with that within the next year the guy was staying at a mate's place, and one day when they were both high Crazy-Eyes came up behind his mate and caved his skull in with something. Word was that it was over his mate saying something innocuous or taking the last of some chips or something. Surely you're always surprised hearing someone you've met is now a killer, but sometimes, for some people, you're less surprised.  TL;DR Met a weirdly intense dude at a party who gave me reason to remember him. He ended up caving his mates skull in.   permalink embed save give gold [–] GreatBabu  15 points 16 points 17 points  1 year ago  (0 children)  There were upwards of 60 people at this thing, so no reason to not mingle.

Repeatedly. The girl's brother and a neighbor beat him senseless in the yard and held him there until the police arrived. I knew him through work, he would often have angry outbursts over such small things. We worked in a restaurant, when things would get busy he would get very on edge. If an order didn't come out fast enough he would snap at our coworkers who normally had nothing to do with it. I also had met his ex girlfriend, she had left him because he had put her in the hospital several times. She had one really ugly scar on her arm, she said he had shoved her and the way she landed her elbow shattered the mirror. Eventually she wised up and left him, several of my coworkers thought she was exaggerating until he killed his girlfriend. To answer the question though, I didn't really think he was capable of murder.  I was definitely shocked, yes he had anger problems but my coworkers and I spent a lot of time with him inside and outside of work. He had gotten fired a few months before he killed her, and I had hung out with him briefly. The whole entire time he seemed off and I decided not to ever talk to him again. Then a few months later I saw him on the news.   permalink embed save give gold [–] PiesOfCream  13 points 14 points 15 points  1 year ago  (1 child) I went to high school with this kid we'll call Jay.

Rick talked his way in, tied up the mom and 5 year old brother. He waited until the teenage sister got home from school tied her up, raped and shot her. I went to high school with her and she was a friend of a friend. Then Rick waited for the Dad to get home from work, and stabbed him, the mom, and little brother to death.

By the time I was a senior in college, he had apparently gotten pretty into drugs and was dating a girl who was 17-18 years old. They got into an argument at his house and he stabbed her over 20 times with a screwdriver, then hid her body in a nearby bog. He bragged about it to a friend, who turned him in. It was pretty shocking because everyone I knew had pretty much forgotten about him, and only knew him as a joke from what when we were kids.  The second was a guy I worked with in the mail room at college. I didn't know him that well, but he seemed nice enough. He always told these really ridiculous stories about his weekends--he would be like, "Me and my friends were at McDonalds, and we all had our guns on us"--which no one really took seriously. A couple of years after I graduated, he was arrested for shooting another guy to death in an argument over a stolen gun. For me and my other friends who worked with him, this one was way more of a "Oh, shit, we spent tons of time with this person every week and never considered that he would do this." But I guess maybe we should have, because he loved talking about guns.   permalink embed save give gold [–] ilikesamaxe  8 points 9 points 10 points  1 year ago  (0 children) I dont want to go into detail, and didnt know this guy very well, but we were friends in school, and he was always a really nice laid back guy (not too common in the small town I grew up in where your friends either played the same sports, went to the same church, etc. Cliques were pretty tight in this town). Ran into him a few years after school, and he was the same, nice to everyone, guy. Got a pretty stressful job, but seemed to do ok. Snapped one night and shot his mother and sister. I've heard (this is second or third hand knowledge) that what he did didnt really hit him until after a couple days in jail (he turned himself in right away). I guess it knocked him a bit loose, doubt he will ever be ok again. I feel bad for him.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Dizrhythmia129  7 points 8 points 9 points  1 year ago  (0 children) A girl I went to middle and high school with and dated a guy I was friendly with throughout middle school dropped out right before our sophomore year. She ended up getting on heroin and dated a  junkie a few years older. Six months later she and her boyfriend were broke, so they attempted to rob a dealer, and ended up stabbing him to death in the process. I believe she was the one that wielded the knife. It was pretty fucked up. The "First 48" show did an episode about her, actually, and you can see her being interviewed around the 30 min mark here . My high school was the only Catholic one in the city, but we were known for our batshit insane stories, and she's just one of many.   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  9 points 10 points 11 points  1 year ago *  (6 children) Amazingly, I know three murderers.  First one was a kid I went to school with. Normal kid by all means, we used to skateboard together, listen to music, smoke some weed. Just general teenage boy stuff.  Then a couple years ago I heard about him on the news. He broke into an elderly women's home with another kid from our high school and during an attempt to rob her he beat her to death with a pistol. It was pretty fucked up and really shook our town for a while.  EDIT: Oh yea, and one of them raped the poor woman. It was really fucked up.  http://www.yourohiovalley.com/story/19727043/two-belmont-county-men-are-arrested-in-the-murder-of-elderly-woman  Second murderer was really close to home. A good friend of my mom's split up with his wife and lost custody of his only son. The wife got with a new boyfriend who was kind of nuts. He ended up beating the son to death one night in a drunken rage and tried to say a dresser fell on him.  EDIT: This isn't an article, but the a copy of the article. The original article was taken down for some reason. http://missing87975.yuku.com/topic/2185  Third one was another abusive boyfriend. Another close friend of my mom split up with her boyfriend who then got with an old high school fling of his. She had a couple kids. Well one day when the guy was home alone with the kids he threw one of them down the stairs and killed him.  EDIT: Can't find an article for this one.  EDIT: Just adding this for the sake of adding it, my grandfather could technically be called a murderer. He never spoke of it often but he a killed a few people when he was deployed in Korea. I personally don't see this as "murder" murder. Mostly because he was doing the job he was sent there to do, and if he hadn't killed them in all likelihood they would of killed him.  So yea, those are the few murderers I know.  I reacted pretty badly to the kid I went to high school with. I wrote him some pretty strongly worded letters and kind of just completely went off on him.  The second one was really close to me too. I grew up with the kid, for the few years he was alive, and he was a wonderful little guy. Still miss him a lot and hang out with his dad. Really awesome guy whose been through way too much.  The third one was just kind of a "wow someone killed a kid, what a piece of shit" and then forget it sort of thing. I barely knew anyone involved.  As far as seeing them coming? Not really. Especially the kid I went to high school with. I could never imagine him doing something like that. But here we are.  If anyone's interested, I might be able to find articles for all of these.  EDIT: Adding articles.   permalink embed save load more comments (6 replies) [–] Ratatat-kat  7 points 8 points 9 points  1 year ago  (0 children) My old middle school history teacher killed his wife by shoving her down the stairs. He was everyone's favorite teacher back in the day. Looking back, it does seem odd that his favorite story to tell from his life as a Marine was when he killed & skinned a monkey in the jungle & it so closely resembled a humans skeleton.   permalink embed save give gold [–] AwkwardlyWhistling  7 points 8 points 9 points  1 year ago  (0 children) In high school, a friend dated a girl named Renee who I just had a really bad feeling about. I knew their relationship was rocky, and I was constantly encouraging her to break up with Renee. She was pretty much just rotten. We were a bunch of punk teenagers at the time, but Renee was into a lot "harder" stuff than we were. She was absolutely going for that "don't give a fuck" punk vibe, where she would destroy shit for no reason, generally insult people, and purposefully try to do harm to herself and others. (A big warning sign was that she forcefully carved her name into my friend, her then girlfriend's, hip with a knife.) She also just didn't seem to have any parents? She had dropped out of high school, her parents had moved to another town, and they had apparently just left Renee to hop between living with friends and their parents. 
After I had spent months trying to get my friend to leave her, she did. About two months later, we heard that she had shot her new girlfriend in the face.
She did 2 years in jail for reckless homicide. She was only 17 at the time, and claimed it had been an accident. Given how often she beat and threatened to murder my friend, though, I really wonder if it was.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Alundra828  8 points 9 points 10 points  1 year ago  (2 children) I knew a kid at school. He was a massive cunt. There is really no other way to explain it. He had 0 friends, because every human he came into contact with he would assault, bully, or just make miserable. He got into some pretty serious gang stuff very, very young. Which was unusual, because we lived in a relatively nice area, at a Church of England school.  He broke into the school, vandalized a load of artwork, set fire to one of the annexes and then beat the shit out of the janitor guy.  Everyone knew who did it straight away. After that point, he just went off the rails.  Anyway, he killed a few kids after he stole a car. Just ploughed straight into them. He then killed himself by huffing a load of glue.  There was a memorial to him at our school saying he was a lovely young boy. Everyone took turns after school spitting on it. We were all united in hatred of this absolute fuck head. Of course now I'm older I realize he probably had some massive issues with parents and upbringing etc.   permalink embed save give gold load more comments (2 replies) [–] ace02786  21 points 22 points 23 points  1 year ago  (0 children) I knew this guy in my drama class in my last year in college, who murdered a fellow student. What's messed up is he had the audacity to write a playwright based on her murder BEFORE he was caught. He and I were among the four selected out of the class to have our plays performed out; it is weird looking back now as to how brazen of him to make a play of an actual murder her commited and how his play beat mine. He was a confident and well liked guy (especially by girls) too. I recalled he took forensics class with us too and they found that he tried to make fix the crime scene as though it was done by It was when the semester was over that we learned he was arrested. He was supposed to graduate with us but he's now serving time   permalink embed save give gold [–] HoboTheDinosaur  6 points 7 points 8 points  1 year ago  (0 children) I went to church with a guy who grew up to be a murderer. We were never super close but we were in the same grade and pretty much grew up together. He wasn't terribly bright, but he was a nice enough kid. In high school he got into a really bad car wreck that left him comatose for three months and he had a lot of brain damage afterwards. He was still pretty active in church, attending Sunday school and even volunteering to read bible passages even though kindergarteners read faster than him. I never minded too much because it was just nice that he was still interested and wanted to put in the effort.  Anyway, a couple of years ago he murdered a pregnant hooker and had sex with her body. I didn't know him that well to start with and I hadn't kept up with him much after freshman year of college, so I was pretty much blindsided by the whole thing. Other people that I talked to mentioned that they knew he wasn't right in the head after the accident, and the police report included a statement from someone who knew him that he tortured and killed animals previous to the incident. IIRC he is currently serving life without parole.   permalink embed save give gold [–] ok2nvme  6 points 7 points 8 points  1 year ago  (0 children) The murders themselves were shocking, but in a way I was both shocked and not shocked when we he got caught. He had done long prison stretches before for crimes he "didn't commit." And basically every guy who came from where he came from was a thug that I would expect to be capable of murder.  But, on the other hand, he was a jovial, personable, charismatic guy. He beat me in chess more than I beat him. I helped throw him a birthday party and lent him a wife beater. We weren't "friends" exactly, more friend of a friend. No reason at all why I should have "seen it coming," but still. You never expect to wake up one day and learn that a dude you hung out with several times is a serial killer.   permalink embed save give gold [–] helloimcold  7 points 8 points 9 points  1 year ago  (1 child) I slept with a guy who ended up stabbing another guy to death for hitting on his girlfriend.

The most outstanding thing I remember about him was the way he could suck his belly in until it seemed there was nothing between his belly button and his spine but a little skin. Other than that he was just like everyone else we mixed with. From the complicated conspiracy theories that surfaced after the fact my guess is he had problems with schizophrenia.   permalink embed save give gold [–] phantomtollb00th  2 points 3 points 4 points  1 year ago  (3 children) My step dad is a sweet guy but happens to have known a couple serial killers.  One guy he worked with in the 80's. Killed two or three of his wives. Then he killed his mom or something. My step dad has his business card and wanted me to sell it on one of those murder memorabilia sites but the guy wasn't Gracy or anything so he'd only get like, $10.  My mom and step dad started dating right before the coworker was arrested. Mom and him went to a party and this dude wanted mom and stepdad to come party with him in his limo. Mom said the dude gave her the creeps like, immediately. She also said he was at the party with a hooker but kept talking about how sick his wife was at home. He also hit on my mom in front of the hooker when my step dad went to the barroom. Class act, right?  Another guy he grew up with down the street. The guy went to mortuary school after high school. He didn't actually do the killing but was helpful in the dismembering. My step dad told me that the dudes who actually did the killing didn't get in trouble but that his buddy with the dismembering is still doing time. I didn't get the details but that doesn't sound right.   permalink embed save give gold load more comments (3 replies) [–] MonstersUGrad98  3 points 4 points 5 points  1 year ago  (0 children) A friends dad killed his family in their sleep and then himself. Wife, a few kids, a baby. Was all to do with debt.  No one saw it coming at all and we (friends of the children) all still occasionally talk about it to this day. I remember the closest friends of the children who were at our school being taken out of the classroom. Depressing and really sad day. The murderer was your standard neighbourhood guy. Smiled and said hi when you did, held the door open for people, was polite, no signs of any issues and then that happened. It's unnerving. A friend of mine went hunting with the family and shot the gun the dad used a few weeks later to kill his family. He can't stand guns now and refuses to even hold one. He said (roughly, don't quote me exactly on this!), "A gun is made for one thing and one thing only - to take life. I didn't understand that until that shooting. I'd held that same gun and hunting was fun. But now I know that whether it's in defence or an attack, it makes people feel even more righteous and takes away the need to process the thought of what you're actually doing when you pull the trigger." Wise words.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Thanos_Stomps  9 points 10 points 11 points  1 year ago  (0 children) I know more murderers than I care to admit although I would say 90% of them or more, were not cold blooded killers.  Most were incidental, like shooting at them or shooting back at them and just happened to hit someone, and others were drug deals gone south.  One that stands out to me though was one of my brother's "friends" held his girlfriend at gun point, with an AK, knelt her down in her closet and shot he rin the back of the head, execution style.  I forgot to add she was blindfolded too.  He ended up going to my brother for help, I was there at the time.  My brother told me to leave, the guy showered and at his house and was told by my brother he was calling the cops but would let him leave first.  Detectives show up and arrest my brother, for violation of his own probation, but no charges were filed in relation to allowing the kid to shower and letting him change out of his blood drenched clothes.  Anyway, the kid was just a normal fucking dude when I knew him.  Always chill, handled his liquor and drugs well, was never hostile or violent or confrontaional/argumentative.  Just a very passive docile dude.  Whatever his gf did to him I guess pissed him off.  Never found out why he did it.   permalink embed save give gold [–] davemchine  3 points 4 points 5 points  1 year ago  (2 children) Attended school through the 9th grade with a guy who later killed an elderly couple he knew. They knew him from previous visits. He stabbed them over and over so many times the police report said they didn't know how many individual stab wounds there were. He was always a violent person but I was still shocked. He went to jail and last year I heard he might get out.

My grandpa killed his girlfriend when my dad was 20, and then killed himself. My dad showed up to his dad's gf's apartment to find both of them dead. My dad says his dad invited him home from college one weekend to "spend extra time with him." After the weekend, on like a Tuesday morning, my dad found a note with money in it that made it seem like my grandpa just moved away with his girlfriend...that was not the case. apparently my grandpa was the violent type, as he had 4 sons and 1 daughter to keep in line.   permalink embed save give gold [–] AlexatRF21  3 points 4 points 5 points  1 year ago  (0 children) Two of my ex-girlfriends are currently in prison for second degree murder.  The first one, we'll call her R. I really didn't expect her to do such a thing. She was one of those girls who was all bark and no bite. She was being played by a guy who was pitting another girl against her. Emotions escalate when you have a person who knows how to push your buttons and will mash them at his enjoyment.  The second girl, J, yeah, it didn't surprise me at all. She was one of those super nice girls but if she didn't get exactly what she wanted, she would destroy everything around her. She ultimately broke up with me, I believe that's how I escaped that wrath. But a friend of mine who dated her, when he broke up with her, she absolutely trashed the front of his townhouse. Bricks through windows, put holes in the door and garage door, and stopped when she noticed she had cut herself. But not before she bled all over the front door's knob and the handle on the garage door.   permalink embed save give gold [–] PM_ME_UR_CORGIS  3 points 4 points 5 points  1 year ago  (0 children) Not me exactly, but friends of my mom's that I knew vaguely. She used to go clubbing with this couple who had an unhealthy dom/pet relationship. Very open about it and he was very controlling over his partner.  One night my mom and I were watching the news and she saw the guy's face on TV, and that he was arrested for murdering his landlord. Mom called his girlfriend immediately to see if she was okay, and she ended up telling my mom that if she didn't help him kill her and dispose of the body he'd kill her too. So they strangled the landlord and buried her in the desert.  It was a pretty big shock to find all of this out, especially since we saw this woman a lot more since my mom has a big heart and let her stay at our place since she had nowhere else to go, plus her boyfriend had connections on the outside of prison making sure she didn't leave the state, because if she did one of HIS connections would kill her.  Mom said she didn't see it coming at all, and all of us were pretty disturbed as we learned more about it because it's like, there's a murderer living with us. In our house. This woman helped kill someone. And as she opened up to my mom more about it, there was a lot less coercion as she claimed when it all happened, and she had plenty of outs but never took them. Real sketchy situation, my mom and her don't talk anymore.   permalink embed save give gold [–] Mrsbobdobbs  1 point 2 points 3 points  1 year ago  (1 child) A good friend of mine used to live on the same block as Jeffrey Dahmer. She said they'd always wave and say hi when they were out, and that his grandmother sometimes baked cookies for them. They said he just seemed like a normal guy, almost boring. They never had much of an impression of him, but his grandmother was very kind. Although her parents decided to move within a year or two because "the neighborhood was getting a little seedy". I also went to school with a cousin of the unibomber. I guess he was a very kind and bright guy before the government screwed with his head. In the pictures he looked very kind and deep thinking.

She went missing for a week or so, and the cops kept coming around to ask us all questions about her - we were genuinely concerned for this girl. Then we come to find out she had taken off for the Everglades to hide out, after having drugged and restrained her roommate, slitting his throat, and writing messages in his blood on the wall.

We weren't particularly close but we did hang out occasionally in a group setting. If you'd asked me what he was like prior to the events of the marathon bombing I would have told you that he was a relaxed, quiet, and decent guy. I remember getting a message from a friend of mine immediately after preliminary sketches were released along the lines of "Hey dude, doesn't that kind of look like Jahar?" but wrote it off. Once it was confirmed to be him it did feel weird but this was all during the manhunt so I was more concerned about the well being of those close to me than I was about him.  I hardly think about it at all anymore. I was reading the wikipedia page for ADX Florence a few days ago and was surprised to see his name on the list of inmates.

This had two effects on me that no one could have guessed would have happened.  The first thing that happened was in September, roughly a month after the school year started, one of my classmates from that history class killed himself.  I'd seen him, shaken my head at the teacher for fussing at him for not paying attention to her when I could tell he was going through something because I had that same look on my face (was dealing with an eating disorder and a serious cutting addiction at the time).  I always meant to say something to him, but I never built up the guts to.  The second thing that happened was that in that class we had a group project to do in which we chose a decade and made a presentation on major events in American history at that time.  It was a fun project.  I dressed up as Janis Joplin.  I was paired with the other kids no one wanted to be grouped with so we got to choose our decade first.  We chose the 60's.  In this group was a quiet stoner guy.  He knew a lot about music and was secretly highly intelligent.  I felt something like kinship with him because we were both black in a deep south state and intelligent, with all of the racist treatment that certain teachers would dole out to people like us because they didn't like smart black kids.  I had another class with him the next semester, a math class.  He was quiet in there too.  He graduated the semester after that, in December.  He had kind of faded from my memory by then because I was entering my senior year and there was a lot going on at that point.  About a year after he graduated he shot his girlfriend in the back of the head point blank because she was pregnant and wanted to break up with him.  It shook our entire school up.  He was such a chill guy, no one suspected he would be the type to do something like that.  At the same time, she was also a graduate of our high school.  On a personal level, I was friends with her first cousin, who she was best friends with.  It ripped us up.  EDIT: There was also a guy in my math class my freshman year who ended up beating a guy my junior year with a pipe because he was trying to sell meth in the same part of town that he normally sold meth.

(Deadspin question)      This was a question on Deadspin Funbag .  Chris:  So there's this Washington Post story going around about a bat-**** German guy who killed his geezer wife and claims to be an Iraqi general. Thing is, I've SEEN this guy around Georgetown for years  I've walked past him at least a few times.  It got me thinking  how many times have I crossed paths with certifiable killers? It has to be a surprisingly high number, right?  It depends on where you live. If you live somewhere with a high murder rate... SURPRISE! You may have shaken hands with Monster Kody Scott. But if you grew up on the mean streets of Wayzata, Minn., as I did, that number is probably negligible (and I don't count military personnel, I'm talking people who have maliciously killed others). Since the year I was born (1976), there have been roughly 20,000 murders in the US per year, which would make for 680,000 murders over the course of my lifetime. That's a few hundred thousand murderers to potentially stumble across, so I guess you might shake hands with one of two in your travels. I went to school with a murderer.   In July, Mr. Ko was convicted of second-degree murder for killing Hyseung Lynda Hong, 26, in her Manhattan apartment in March 1998, slashing her throat in what prosecutors described as an attack intended to impress a jealous girlfriend.  I think I might have said hi to him at one point or another. I can't really remember. It's not a terribly comforting thought.

(Deadspin question)      For people in urban areas, chances are fairly good.  It's easy to meet 2000 in your life and if 1 in 2000 people are murderers (this looks to be a reasonable estimate), then your chances of meeting one become 1 - 1/e ~ 63% just from random chance.  But to my knowledge, I have yet to meet one.      Last edited by tringlomane; 09-14-2011 at 04:39 PM .

Since I'm British, Vicky's British and neither of us are murderers (as far as I know), I think we can safely say that about 33.3333% of British poker players are murderers. Statistics are rigged, obviously.

Photograph: Public domain     I n 1987, Adrian Raine, who describes himself as a neurocriminologist, moved from Britain to the US. His emigration was prompted by two things. The first was a sense of banging his head against a wall. Raine, who grew up in Darlington and is now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was a researcher of the biological basis for criminal behaviour, which, with its echoes of Nazi eugenics, was perhaps the most taboo of all academic disciplines.  In Britain, the causes of crime were allowed to be exclusively social and environmental, the result of disturbed or impoverished nurture, rather than fated and genetic nature. To suggest otherwise, as Raine felt compelled to, having studied under Richard Dawkins and been persuaded of the "all-embracing influence of evolution on behaviour", was to doom yourself to an absence of funding. In America, there seemed more open-mindedness on the question and, as a result, more money to explore it. There was also another good reason why Raine headed initially to California: there were more murderers to study than there were at home.  When Raine started doing brain scans of murderers in American prisons, he was among the first researchers to apply the evolving science of brain imaging to violent criminality. His most comprehensive study, in 1994, was still, necessarily, a small sample. He conducted PET [positron emission tomography] scans of 41 convicted killers and paired them with a "normal" control group of 41 people of similar age and profile. However limited the control, the colour images, which showed metabolic activity in different parts of the brain, appeared striking in comparison. In particular, the murderers' brains showed what appeared to be a significant reduction in the development of the prefrontal cortex, "the executive function" of the brain, compared with the control group.  The advancing understanding of neuroscience suggested that such a deficiency would result in an increased likelihood of a number of behaviours: less control over the limbic system that generates primal emotions such as anger and rage; a greater addiction to risk; a reduction in self-control; and poor problem-solving skills, all traits that might predispose a person to violence.  Even two decades ago, these were difficult findings to publish, however. When Raine presented a far less controversial paper in 1994 to a peer group, one that showed a combination of birth complications and early maternal rejection in babies had significant correlation with individuals becoming violent offenders 18 years later, it was denounced as "racist and ideologically motivated" and, according to Nature magazine, was simply further strong evidence that "the uproar surrounding attempts to find biological causes for social problems will continue". Similarly, when, 15 years ago, at the urging of his friend Jonathan Kellerman, the child psychologist and crime writer, Raine put together a proposal for a book on some of his scientific findings, no publisher would touch it. That book, The Anatomy of Violence , a clear-headed, evidence-based and carefully provocative account of Raine's 35 years of study, has only now appeared.  The reason for this delay seems mired in ideological enmities. For all Raine's rigour, his discipline of "neurocriminology" still remains tarnished, for some, by association with 19th-century phrenology, the belief that criminal behaviour stemmed from defective brain organisation as evidenced in the shape of the skull. The idea was first proposed by the infamous Franz Joseph Gall, who claimed to have identified over- or underdeveloped brain "organs" that gave rise to specific character: the organ of destructiveness, of covetousness and so on, which were recognisable to the phrenologist by bumps on the head. Phrenology was widely influential in criminal law in both the United States and Europe in the middle of the 1800s, and often used to support crude racial and class-based stereotypes of criminal behaviour.  The divisive thinking was developed further in 1876 by Cesare Lombroso, an Italian surgeon, after he conducted a postmortem on a serial murderer and rapist. Lombroso discovered a hollow part of the killer's brain, where the cerebellum would be, from which he proposed that violent criminals were throwbacks to less evolved human types, again identifiable by ape-like physical characteristics. The political manipulation of such hypotheses in the eugenics movement eventually saw them wholly outlawed and discredited.  As one result, after the second world war, crime became attributable to economic and political factors, or psychological disturbances, but not to biology. Prompted by advances in genetics and neuroscience, however, that consensus is increasingly fragile, and the implications of those scientific advances for law – and for concepts such as culpability and responsibility – are only now being tested. He draws on a number of studies that show the links between brain development, in particular – and brain injury and impairment by extension – and criminal violence. Already legal defence teams, particularly in the US, are using brain scans and neuroscience as mitigating evidence in the trials of violent criminals and sex offenders. In this sense, Raine believes a proper public debate on the implications of his science is long overdue.  Raine was in part drawn to his discipline by his own background. In the course of scanning his murderers, Raine also examined his own PET profile and found, somewhat to his alarm, that the structure of his brain seemed to share more characteristics with the psychopathic murderers than with the control group.  He laughs quickly when I ask how that discovery felt. "When you have a brain scan that looks like a serial killer's it does give you pause," he says. And there were other factors: he has always had a markedly low heart rate (which his research has shown to be a truer indicator of a capacity for violence than, say, smoking is as a cause of lung cancer). He was plagued by cracked lips as a child, evidence of riboflavin deficiency (another marker); he was born at home; he was a blue baby, all factors in the kind of developmental difficulties that might set his own researcher's alarm bells ringing.  "So," he says, "I was on the spectrum. And in fact I did have some issues. I was taken to hospital aged five to have my stomach pumped because I had drunk a lot of alcohol. From age nine to 11 I was pretty antisocial, in a gang, smoking, letting car tyres down, setting fire to mailboxes, and fighting a lot, even though I was quite small. But at that age I burnt out of that somehow. At 11, I changed schools, got more interested in studying and really became a different sort of kid. Still, when I was graduating and thinking 'what shall I research?', I looked back on the essays I'd written and one of the best was on the biology of psychopaths; I was fascinated by that, partly, I think, because I had always wondered about that early behaviour in myself."  As Raine began to explore the subject more, he began to look at the reasons he became a researcher of violent criminality, rather than a violent criminal. (Recent studies suggest his biology might equally have propelled him towards other careers – bomb disposal expert, corporate executive or journalist – that tend to attract individuals with those "psychopathic" traits.) Despite his unusual brain structure, he didn't have the low IQ that is often apparent in killers, or any cognitive dysfunction. Still, as he worked for four years interviewing people in prison, a lot of the time he was thinking: what stopped me being on their side of the bars?  Raine's biography, then, was a good corrective to the seductive idea that our biology is our fate and that a brain scan can tell us who we are. Even as he piles up evidence to show that people are not the free-thinking, rational agents they like to imagine themselves to be – entirely liberated from the limitations set by our inherited genes and our particular neuroanatomy – he never forgets that lesson. The question remains, however, that if these "biomarkers" do exist and exert an influence – and you begin to see the evidence as incontrovertible – then what should we do about them?  Perhaps we should do nothing, simply ignore them, assume, when it comes to crime, that every individual has much the same brain, the same capacity to make moral choices, as we tend to do now. As Raine suggests: "The sociologist would say if we concentrate on these biological things, or even acknowledge them, we are immediately taking our eyes off other causes of criminal behaviour – poverty, bad neighbourhoods, poor nutrition, lack of education and so on. All things that need to change. And that concern is correct. It is why social scientists have fought this science for so long."  The implication of neurocriminology, though – where it differs from the crude labelling of phrenology, say – is that the choice it presents is not an either/or between nurture and nature, but a more complex understanding of how our biology reacts with its environment. Reading Raine's account of the most recent research into these reactions, it still seems to me quite new and surprising that environmental factors change the physical structure of the brain. We tend to talk about a child's development in terms of more esoteric ideas of mind rather than material brain structures, but the more you look at the data the clearer the evidence that abuse or neglect or poor nutrition or prenatal smoking and drinking have a real effect on whether or not those healthy neural connections – which lead to behaviour associated with maturity, self-control and empathy – are made. The science of this is called epigenetics, the way our environment regulates the expression of our innate genetic code.  One result of epigenetics might be, Raine suggests, that "social scientists can actually win from this. I mean, if a child experiences a murder in his or her neighbourhood, we have found that their test scores on a range of measures go down. There is something happening in the brain as a result of that experience of violence to affect cognition. So social scientists can have their cake and eat it. They can say look, we can prove that these environmental social factors are causing brain impairment, which leads to some real, measurable problems."  One difficulty of embracing this "epigenetical" idea of crime is the degree to which such factors should be taken into account in courts of law. There have been several landmark cases in recent years in which particular neurological disorders caused by blows to the skull or undetected tumours have resulted in arguable changes in character and behaviour – and the violent or sexual crime is blamed on the disorder, not the individual. In most of these cases, it has been argued by the prosecution that brain imaging is prejudicial, that the brightly coloured pictures are too compelling to a jury and more emotional than scientific. But if neural scanning becomes more routine, and neuroscience more precise, will there not come a point where most violent behaviour – that of the Boston bombers, say, or the Newtown killer – is argued away in court as an illness, rather than a crime?  Raine believes that there might well be. He even likens such a shift to our change in perception of cancer, until fairly recently often deemed the "fault" of the sufferer because of some repressive character trait. "If we buy into the argument that for some people factors beyond their control, factors in their biology, greatly raise the risk of them becoming offenders, can we justly turn a blind eye to that?" Raine asks. "Is it really the fault of the innocent baby whose mother smoked heavily in pregnancy that he went on to commit crimes? Or if he was battered from pillar to post, or even if he was born with a, abnormally low resting heart rate, how harshly should we punish him? How much should we say he is responsible? There is, and increasingly will be, an argument that he is not fully responsible and therefore, when we come to think of punishment, should we be thinking of more benign institutions than prison?"  But then there is a further thought, that if you start to see criminality as a biological illness, where does a sense of retributive justice stand?  Raine himself was forced to face this dilemma when he became a victim of violent crime. As he recounts in his book, while on holiday in Turkey several years ago, a burglar entered his bedroom and in the struggle that followed tried to cut Raine's throat with a knife. He fought the attacker off, but when the following morning he was presented with two possible suspects by police, he admits to not only choosing the one who looked most like a thug [the man later admitted the crime, under duress], but also to wanting to visit on him the terror he had felt himself.  "I wasn't proud to discover I was a bit Jekyll and Hyde – perhaps we all are in that situation," Raine says when I ask him about his response. "The rational Dr Jekyll knew that if I took this man's brain scan and found he had prefrontal dysfunction, low resting heart rate, a background of neglect, then of course I should cut him some slack. With understanding comes mercy. But the Mr Hyde, the emotional voice in my head, was saying nothing of the sort: he was saying, he cut my throat, I want to cut his. That event changed me from someone dead set against the death penalty to someone who wouldn't be ruled out of a jury on a capital case in America. I think now my mind will always go backwards and forwards on this, the scientific understanding of the causes of crime versus being a human in society with all these gut reactions to people who commit awful crimes."  If the neuroscience raises as many questions as it answers about culpability after a crime has been committed, what about its role in crime prevention? Here, the questions seem no less fraught.  One of them was posed a couple of years ago by the arch-inquisitor Jeremy Paxman of Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty, on Newsnight . "If science could predict with 100% certainty who was going to commit a violent crime, would it be legitimate to act before they commit that crime?"  Chakrabarti was in no doubt: "I would have to say that in a liberal society of human beings, and not animals, my answer to your question would be 'no'."  But if such intervention could prevent Newtown, you wonder, or Dunblane, would any of us be quite so certain? The fact is that the reality will always be a much greyer area because even the most nuanced neuroscience will never produce a perfect prediction of human behaviour. But is there a point at which the science – in identifying the possibility of repeat offending, for example – will be accurate enough to warrant routine scanning of those on the sexual offenders' register?  "The fact is," Raine says, "parole boards are making exactly these kind of predictive decisions every day about which prisoner or young offender we are going to release early, often with crummy evidence. At the moment, the predictors are social and behavioural factors, marital status, your past record. What is not used are biological measures. But I believe that if we added those things even now into the equation, we could only improve the prediction."  Raine cites two very recent brain-imaging studies to back this up. One is a study in New Mexico in which prisoners are scanned on release. "What they are discovering is that if the functioning of the anterior cingulate, part of the limbic system, is lower than normal before release, they are twice as likely to be reconvicted in the next three years. And that marker is more accurate a guide than all other social factors," Raine says. A second study apparently shows if a released prisoner has a significantly smaller volume in the amygdala, the almond-shaped part of the brain crucial for processing memory and emotion, he or she is three times more likely to reoffend. "Now, this is only two studies, but what they are beginning to show is proof of concept, that if we added neurological factors into the equation we could do a better job at predicting future behaviour."  At the end of his book, Raine suggests various possible Orwellian futures of such science, an ethical "slippery slope" of interventions that ultimately imagines a society that assesses the biological risk of all individuals – a wide-scale version of We Need to Talk About Kevin – and pre-emptively locks up those at the extreme end of the curve (a sort of evidence-based Guantánamo). He by no means advocates any of it, though when I ask if he would have his own children, two boys of 11, scanned, he suggests he probably would.  "If there was the opportunity for screening at school or through a GP programme, would I do it? Well, if my kids had problems, as a parent I would want to know about them and I would want to know how I might deal with them. If you brought in such things as emotion regulation and impulse control, which we know are risk factors for behaviour, then to me, as a parent, I would sort of want to know what could be done to help with those."  It is perhaps not too wildly far-fetched to imagine that such scans will one day be as routine as immunisation programmes; the bigger question then will be how we begin to react to the results. Raine rather likes the idea of public health programmes as crime prevention: "The teenage brain is still very malleable. There is good evidence from randomised control testing that omega-3 [fish oil] has a positive effect on young offenders, and even mindfulness seems to improve behaviour and brain structures."  You can't help thinking: if only it were as simple as that.  • This article was amended on Sunday 12 May 2013. Adrian Raine is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, not Philadelphia as we mistakenly said in the original article. This has been corrected.  • This article was amended on Monday 13 May. A paragraph that misrepresented the views of the neuroscientist David Eagleman has been removed. The paragraph implied that Eagleman believed that the possession of particular genes resulted in criminal behaviour. This is not his belief, in his words, "Genes are part of the story, but they're not the whole story. We are likewise influenced by the environments in which we grow up".
