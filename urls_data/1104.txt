Mar 25, 2008     1,993 Posts               I am not a geneticist but have a degree in biochemistry so I took genetics as part of my required courses. The two things aren't really related, like multiple  members have mentioned above, hair color and eye color are alleles of different genes. I think it's cute that everybody is mentioning  their aunt/friend/daughter as examples but ,ultimately, it all comes down to the science.  Read the articles, the others have listed, if you want to know how this stuff works.             #32    May 15, 2008                  Sass   Fashion Honey  Thread Starter            Jun 23, 2007     1,280 Posts     Health          thanks everyone for your help and attached articles. Im sorry if have irritated anyone with my question, I was just wondering!  Yes i have seen children/ young teenagers who have blonde hair and brown eyes but i always understood that almost all would eventually grow up to have brown hair (even very light shades) and brown eyes.  My question was actually in reference to adults though. I have a basic understanding of the genetics its just that i've never actually seen it myself in real life on an adult.

According to the Forrest Gump law as applied to genetics: "You never know whutchew gonna git," brown-eyed blondes are far from the strangest things that are genetically possible .  It is possible to win the Power Ball, however that does not make it likely, and when we add that to the fact, as several have pointed out, that blonde hair, whether accompanied by brown eyes or not, tends to darken with age, and add to that the prevalence of changing/choosing one's hair color, and one more - add to that the perception of blonde as an especially desirable and attractive hair color, the likelihood, the probability, that either  Jessica Simpson, Shayne Lamas, or even the New Work Out skank Renessa are natural blondes today , is smaller than the likelihood that they A) were blondes as children B) really have blue eyes but are wearing brown contacts C) look as pretty as they would if they let it grow out.            #39    May 24, 2008                  chiara   piacere            Apr 11, 2006     472 Posts             missjenny2679 said: ↑   I think Britney Spears has Blonde hair and Brown eyes,but she might wear blue contacts....

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Blond Hair  Black People  Genetics and Heredity  Race and Ethnicity  Existence Question Are there natural blonde adult people with dark brown eyes? I saw a beautiful photo of a child with blonde hair and dark eyes from the Soloman Islands. Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers   Lucas Lundström Answered Apr 12, 2015 · Author has 536 answers and 853.1k answer views Yes. Domestic disputes as well as normal fights are common among natural blonde adult people as well. If you are referring to the iris of the eye, then yes and no. As we develops from childhood the melanocyte cells slowly begin to produce melanin darkening the irises and giving them the appearance of color. In dark skinned children the eyes are normally dark already from childhood. Irises are really always black or brown, depending on the concentration of melanin in the eye. The reason some eyes look blue or green etc. is not because they physically have that color, but because Rayleigh scattering makes it look like it. In either case, what I guess you are really asking is "Can adult blonde people have dark brown eyes?" and yes, adult blonde people can have dark brown eyes. It is uncommon, but can happen. The problem here is really to come to a consensus about what constitutes "black" eyes, and "blonde" hair. If I go into my local hair studio doing extensions here in Göteborg, Sweden, and pick up a packet of hair that we all strongly feel is clearly "brown" it will be labeled "blonde" because the manufacturer is American. American "blonde" is brown to us, brown to Americans is often dark brown or black to us, black to Americans seems mostly to be a racial term.., and Swedish true blonde seems to confuse Americans. If we go by American standards of what blonde hair looks like, then absolutely natural blondes can have naturally dark eyes. If we go to a little bit more reasonable level, then yes, it seems possible but uncommon. Sharp racial mixes may bring up this lovely mix of attributes, so look to people with for example one pale white British parent and one dark South American (dark Brazilian, dark Peruvian, etc.) parent. You can also check out the native Sami people of Northern Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Finland) that are sometimes quite blonde with really dark eyes. If you want to geek down and get into the nitty gritty check out MC1R which seems to be one of the key proteins that regulate the color of skin and hair, while eye color is controlled by other separate genetic markers. Some bring up the Brazilian model Victoria Brito as en example in discussions about blonde hair and dark eyes. It is difficult to assess her hair color from pictures, being a model and having her hair fixed over and over again, and trends these days include sometimes faking a lighter or darker outgrowth than the model naturally has. In some pictures she has just one hair color (most often light), and in others she has another darker or lighter outgrowth than the main hair color. 30.9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Myself : I'm from a French- Danish father (blonde, fair skin, bright blue eyes almost gray) and a Berber (Moroccan) mother (original population of North Africa, they are many ethnicities among the Berbers in my case my mother is descendant of a more Caucasian Berber group (Vandals ?), dark brown hair, brown eyes or pale gray eyes, olive skin and a Caucasian skull). I was born with black hair and a blonde strand of hair in the front of my head, and yellow/very light brown eyes as I grew up my hair fell progressively and got replaced by a full head of blonde and my eyes darkened. The nature of my hair is wavy. Funny how my eyes despite being dark they act up like light eyes and are very photosensitive. My skin is very fair (burns never tan) and I've got a straight nose.

[1] The common occurrence of blond hair among the dark-skinned indigenous people of the Solomon Islands is due to a homegrown genetic variant distinct from the gene that leads to blond hair in Europeans. In more detail [2] Blond hair is a rare human phenotype found almost exclusively in Europe and Oceania. Here, we identify a cystine-to-arginine change at a highly conserved residue in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) as the single source of blond hair in Solomon Islanders. This missense mutation is predicted to impact catalytic activity of the protein and causes blond hair through a recessive mode of inheritance. The novel mutation is at a frequency of 26% in the Solomon Islands but is absent outside of Oceania and represents the largest genetic effect on a visible human phenotype reported to date. Thus, getting intuition about the correlation between hair pigmentation and skin and eye pigmentation from experiences with Europeans isn’t related to the Soloman Island blonds.

Of course! Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world, and though darker hair is more common than blonde hair, there are going to be plenty of people with blonde hair who have brown eyes (according to the genetic lottery).

What’s the difference between red and strawberry blonde hair?         Experts  What’s the difference between red and strawberry blonde hair?   Share                                 It’s often difficult to tell the difference between red and strawberry blonde hair . In fact, most people confuse the two and say that one is the other without really knowing why. What makes our hair go a deeper red rather than a strawberry blonde color? The pros reveal all.  Red hair, like any other hair color, has many different shades and tones. ‘Red hair can have shades ranging from light strawberry blonde to mahogany colors, but it’s often difficult to tell the difference between the two, unless there are coppery reflections when light hits the hair. Red and strawberry blonde are simply two different shades from the same color palette.’  Strawberry blonde is lighter than red hair. ‘It’s extremely rare for people to have hair that is naturally a strawberry blonde color. Basically, strawberry blonde is mostly based on red tones, with blonde highlights dotted here and there. It takes its name from the Italian renaissance. During this period, women lightened their hair using lemon juice and saffron in combination with the sun’s natural rays of light.’  Strawberry blonde therefore belongs to the red hair group. ‘Strawberry blonde is the lightest shade of red hair. Other tones in this color group include mahogany, copper and Irish red. When somebody says they have strawberry blonde hair, they’re stating their shade of red. Blondes might do the same by stating they have ice-blonde hair , for example.  Our tip: Red hair is often much thicker than blonde or brunette hair. To take control of your red hair, use a hair mask for thick hair . You can also try using the Jean Louis David Colour therapy range at home to revive the color of your hair and hydrate it.

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       Why is the combination of red hair and brown eyes so rare?        -A curious adult from Texas   May 18, 2007  No one knows for sure why this is. There isn't any evidence that the DNA changes that cause red hair also affect eye color. Or vice versa.  And the two aren't genetically linked like some other hair and eye colors. For example, blonde hair and blue eyes are known to be linked. Which is why blonde hair and brown eyes are so rare.  But we know this isn't the case for red hair and light colored eyes. How do we know this?  Because the DNA changes in the MC1R gene that cause red hair are on chromosome 16. And the DNA changes in the OCA2 gene that cause blue eyes are found on chromosome 15.  Genetically linked traits need to be on the same chromosome. Like blonde hair and blue eyes which are both found on chromosome 15. This is important because of how genes are passed on to our children.  We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain almost all of our genes. We pass our genes down to our children in these chromosome chunks.  So if the DNA changes for blue eyes and blonde hair happen to both be on the same copy of chromosome 15, then they will tend to travel together*. Think about it like suitcases at the airport.  Imagine you have blonde hair coloring and blue contact lenses that you are taking with you on a trip. If you have two separate suitcases, then there is a chance that one might get sent to Detroit and the other to Honolulu. Your blonde hair coloring will be in one place and your contact lenses in another.  But if you only have one suitcase, everything in it will almost always travel together. Wherever your suitcase ends up, the blonde hair dye and the blue contact lenses will arrive at the same place.  Same thing with genes on the same chromosome. The DNA changes that cause blonde hair and blue eyes are usually on the same chromosome (in the same suitcase). So they usually arrive together.  But this explanation doesn't work for red hair and light eye color because the DNA changes that cause them are on different chromosomes. They are in different suitcases.  Most likely red hair and light colored eyes tend to be together because of luck. And the possible survival advantages of each and the light skin that comes with them.  Let's think back to a time before there was red hair. Imagine for some reason, the folks in Northern Europe have lighter colored eyes. This may be because their ancestors found lighter eyes more attractive ( sexual selection ). Or perhaps there is some other advantage ( click here for some possibilities).  So we have a population in Northern Europe with light colored eyes. And everywhere else there are brown eyes.  Now imagine that a DNA change happens in Africa and in Europe that causes red hair. This wouldn't be surprising -- our DNA changes all the time .  Most of the time these DNA changes don't matter. But sometimes they can cause a disease. And sometimes a DNA change can change how someone looks.  Now we have a redhead in Africa and one in Northern Europe. The redhead in Europe is very successful and does better than the folks around him. So the red hair spreads.  But the redhead in Africa has all sorts of problems. Eventually the red hair gene dies out because s/he can't compete as well as everyone else.  The end result of this is redheads with light colored eyes. Not because the genes are necessarily linked. But because the red hair happened to occur in a population with light colored eyes.  Of course we don't have any evidence for this story. But it is a plausible one because of a side effect of red hair -- light skin.  We need a certain amount of sunlight to make vitamin D. If you don't get enough vitamin D you end up with rickets , an awful disease.  The darker your skin is, the more sunlight you need. Northern Europe gets so little sunlight that lighter skinned people have a real advantage. People like redheads.  In Africa, people with light skin are at a real disadvantage. The extra sunlight exposure can cause birth defects by destroying their folic acid. And they will end up riddled with skin cancer later in life since no one has invented sunscreen yet.  So in which population do you think red hair will prosper and spread? Yup, amongst those Northern Europeans with light colored eyes.  Because of this, you just happen to end up with lots of redheads with light colored eyes. This is one idea anyway.  As more mixing between populations happens, we would predict that red hair and light colored eyes will both become less common. But another prediction, if the little story I've spun is true, is that a larger percentage of the redheads that are left may have brown eyes. We'll have to wait and see.  * This is a simplified version. Because of something called recombination, it is important that the DNA changes be on the same chromosome and close to each other.

Our species was originally dark (full melanocyte activity) but some people became lighter when they moved away from dark equatorial forest, lived in lighter surroundings and their melanocyte cells reacted by a reduction in activity. This gave lighter shades, with reflected outside light, seen as blue, mixing to give hazel, grey or green and near-complete absence of melanin giving 'blue' eyes. We usually follow our nearest relatives in the amount of melanin we have, so if our parents have little melanin (blond hair which is actually very light brown) and blue eyes, we will probably be the same. If one parent has a bit more melanin this will increase our melanin. But nothing in nature is 100% so two blue/eyed, fair-haired parents could just possibly have children whose melanocytes made a little more melanin. 935 Views promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question   Kristina Winifred Osborne , studied at Sir Sandford Fleming College Frost Campus Answered Mar 1, 2015 There is undoubtably a complexity to eye colour and hair colour. Lets start with eyes it is most likely that if two blue eyed parents had a child that the child would have blue eyes about 93% approximately give or take, but there is a 5% chance of hazels eyes being carried as a recessive gene (not all forms of hazel eyes need a dominant brown gene to express this. since hazel is kinda like the wild card when it comes to eye colour) and the the last 2% is green eyes since this is a colour that only really appears from blue eyed parents or carriers of blue eyes. Since green is technically blue eyes with another colour gene that adds melanin (natural brown pigment) to the back layer of the iris which causes the green like effect. (Brown eyes have this colour on the front layer of their iris) and now to the hair, for the most part hair is a bit of a guessing game cause it dosnt really consist of dominate and resessive genes, the DNA that effects your hair tends to be a mix of the parents hair colour on average. Or sometimes a child will display only one parents hair colour. Or you get families like mine that throw all these rules out the window with my grandparents both having light grey blue eyes and one of my uncles having brown eyes, my mother has hazel and the rest of my mothers brothers are blue eyed without expressing the grey hue. And my hair and my sisters is naturaly light brown when both are parents having dark brown almost black hair. So it depends on far more genes then could ever be explained on here and it depends on how many carrier genes the parents have that they probably dont even know about. Like red headed genes... Or hormonal changes as a child ages i was born a dark red head, which changed to blond as a child to darken to the mousy brown i have naturally. And i have another friend who was born with black hair and his all fell out at a young age to become platinum blond. Genes they are a crazy lottery! 3.8k Views Thank you for your feedback!

Answered May 28, 2011 · Author has 390 answers and 1.5m answer views "Contrary to what many of us are taught in school, eye color is not a simple genetic trait. Multiple genes and multiple variants of these genes interact to determine eye color." (see https://www.23andme.com/health/E... ) Hair color is a similarly complex trait, with at least two genes thought to be involved. ( https://www.23andme.com/health/H... ) Because the genetics of either are not entirely understood, the true probability is hard to calculate, but significantly less than 25% is a good guess. As you can see from the Eye Color article above, the data for just one particular gene associated with eye color shows that a person with a genotype correlated with blue/gray eyes (72%) can still have a 27% chance of having green/hazel eyes and 1% chance of black/brown eyes. Assuming for example's sake that the hair color gene(s) work similarly and that the traits are independent, the probability would be 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784 (<8%). 10.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Undo Quora User , Majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at UCSB Answered May 28, 2011 Considering that both traits are controlled by multiple genes finding the true probability would be very hard.  However, for simplicity if both eye and hair color were controlled by one gene each and we assume that blonde hair and blue eyes are recessive, then the probability is 0% that they child will not have either trait.  One could come up with several scenarios like this by changing both the dominance of the gene and the genotype of the parents. 4.3k Views Related Questions Why do most blonde people have blue eyes?

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers   Lucas Lundström Answered Apr 12, 2015 · Author has 536 answers and 853.1k answer views Yes. Domestic disputes as well as normal fights are common among natural blonde adult people as well. If you are referring to the iris of the eye, then yes and no. As we develops from childhood the melanocyte cells slowly begin to produce melanin darkening the irises and giving them the appearance of color. In dark skinned children the eyes are normally dark already from childhood. Irises are really always black or brown, depending on the concentration of melanin in the eye. The reason some eyes look blue or green etc. is not because they physically have that color, but because Rayleigh scattering makes it look like it. In either case, what I guess you are really asking is "Can adult blonde people have dark brown eyes?" and yes, adult blonde people can have dark brown eyes. It is uncommon, but can happen. The problem here is really to come to a consensus about what constitutes "black" eyes, and "blonde" hair. If I go into my local hair studio doing extensions here in Göteborg, Sweden, and pick up a packet of hair that we all strongly feel is clearly "brown" it will be labeled "blonde" because the manufacturer is American. American "blonde" is brown to us, brown to Americans is often dark brown or black to us, black to Americans seems mostly to be a racial term.., and Swedish true blonde seems to confuse Americans. If we go by American standards of what blonde hair looks like, then absolutely natural blondes can have naturally dark eyes. If we go to a little bit more reasonable level, then yes, it seems possible but uncommon. Sharp racial mixes may bring up this lovely mix of attributes, so look to people with for example one pale white British parent and one dark South American (dark Brazilian, dark Peruvian, etc.) parent. You can also check out the native Sami people of Northern Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Finland) that are sometimes quite blonde with really dark eyes. If you want to geek down and get into the nitty gritty check out MC1R which seems to be one of the key proteins that regulate the color of skin and hair, while eye color is controlled by other separate genetic markers. Some bring up the Brazilian model Victoria Brito as en example in discussions about blonde hair and dark eyes. It is difficult to assess her hair color from pictures, being a model and having her hair fixed over and over again, and trends these days include sometimes faking a lighter or darker outgrowth than the model naturally has. In some pictures she has just one hair color (most often light), and in others she has another darker or lighter outgrowth than the main hair color. 30.9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

[1] The common occurrence of blond hair among the dark-skinned indigenous people of the Solomon Islands is due to a homegrown genetic variant distinct from the gene that leads to blond hair in Europeans. In more detail [2] Blond hair is a rare human phenotype found almost exclusively in Europe and Oceania. Here, we identify a cystine-to-arginine change at a highly conserved residue in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) as the single source of blond hair in Solomon Islanders. This missense mutation is predicted to impact catalytic activity of the protein and causes blond hair through a recessive mode of inheritance. The novel mutation is at a frequency of 26% in the Solomon Islands but is absent outside of Oceania and represents the largest genetic effect on a visible human phenotype reported to date. Thus, getting intuition about the correlation between hair pigmentation and skin and eye pigmentation from experiences with Europeans isn’t related to the Soloman Island blonds.

Undo Answer Wiki 100 + Answers   Alyssa Mohammed , Does well in bio, knows about history- thinks Answered Jan 16, 2017 · Author has 659 answers and 729.9k answer views So here’s the thing with genes: they are extremely finnicky. Almost anything is possible, but only a few things are probable— you feel me? So first you need to get that some genes are stronger than others—we call these dominant genes. And generally, genes for dark colours in skin, hair, eyes etc. are dominant over light colours. If we have a dominant gene from one parent and a recessive (weaker) gene from another parent, chances are that the child is going to get the dominant gene. So for example, if the gene for black hair is BB and the gene for blonde is bb , the child could have only one possible hair colour: black. This is shown in the diagram below, (assuming you have 4 kids or less): You see, as long as your dominant black ( BB ) gene is around, her recessive ( bb ) gene will tag along, but your children will appear to have black hair. However, they will be carriers- they will “carry” her blonde genes, and if they have partners with genes that are recessive to blonde hair, their children could be blonde! This is, of course, assuming that you and your girlfriend are both purebred; that is, nowhere in your genes do you have a gene for anything but black hair, and neither does she have a gene for anything but blonde hair. It’s actually quite possible that both of you are “carriers” for other genes. Lets assume that you are a carrier for blonde hair—so your genotype would be Bb —and she is a carrier for red hair, genotype br . Watch the possibilities: In this case, there is a 50% chance of your kids having black hair, and a 50% chance of them having blonde hair—but NO chance of any of them being purebred for black hair since neither of you are. The two red squares indicate the children with black hair; one of them carries a recessive gene for red hair, Br , while the other carries a recessive gene for blonde hair, Bb . The other two squares are the blonde children. One of them is purebred for blonde hair, bb , while the other is a carrier for red hair, br . So long story short: there is no way to ascertain what hair colours they will have without knowing the exact genotypes of you and your girlfriend. However, considering the family history you mentioned, one or more of your kids will probably have black hair, but other colours are possible. 13.3k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Care.com Find childcare near you.

Do parents have a favorite child? What's the best parenting advice? What is the best lie you have ever told your child? Ask New Question   Ryan Mitchell , studied at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering (2011) Answered Jan 16, 2017 · Upvoted by  Nicholas Anthony , MSc Human Genetics, McGill University · Author has 65 answers and 157.8k answer views A lot of the answers here are wrong. They mention things like recessive genes, 25% probabilities, and draw Punnett squares ( Punnett square - Wikipedia ) This would be pretty reasonable, if hair color was determined by a single gene, if blonde genes were always recessive, as is commonly thought, and if the same hair color was always caused by the same genes. But none of this is true. To be fair, there is one gene (consisting of series of base pairs, with many different possible configurations), MC1R, that has a major role in determining the overall “coloring” (melanin production) an individual’s skin, hair, and eyes. The particular copies of this gene that you inherit from your parents can play a large role in your own coloring, but because this gene has so many different configurations from person to person (not simply an “on/off” “1/0” type of thing), it’s difficult to predict how the combination of genes from two different parents might interact. One person’s red hair may very easily be caused by a completely different version of MC1R than another person’s red hair, and may be passed on very differently. MC1R is also supplemented by a wide variety of other genes, some of which are unknown. For example, some peoples in Oceania commonly have blonde hair, caused by a gene mutation that has nothing to do with MC1R, and that evolved independently from European populations with similarly blonde hair. In short, it’s almost impossible to tell! However, I will say that, without knowing anything about your DNA other than hair color, yes, there’s a good chance that your hypothetical children will have a hair color other than black.

I guess the best description would be what L’Oreal calls “Medium Blonde Hair: rich, multi-dimensional blonde with shades that range from golden to sun-kissed to strawberry.” I have very dark hair (essentially black) and blue eyes. Our kids: Same medium blond hair as my wife, with lots of red undertones; somewhat frizzy and prone to forming dreadlocks. Jet black hair and totally straight. Extremely blonde, nearly white hair, which as my son has grown older has darkened up, but does not have the red undertones. When he was little the hair was so fine and wispy that it would just float around his head like a halo. We didn’t have a fourth child, but perhaps number 4 would have had red hair. I don’t know the genetics, but it seems to me that there are red-haired populations where Scandinavians had children with folks with black/dark hair from certain populations. Examples include the Irish (the original Irish came from the Iberian peninsula, among other places) (1) and the Caspian Sea region (Gilan and Mazandaran in Iran). I don’t know if this is from the Viking expeditions down the Volga and into the Caspian area, or if this is a more widespread genetic trait.

Undo   Essence Park , studied Human Biology & Literature at Palomar College Answered Oct 28, 2017 The simplest answer is dark brown/black or medium brown. The scientific answer begins with genetics. The genes responsible for hair color originally produced a lot of pigment(dark colors) while blonde/light hair is actually a mutation somewhere along one of the genes that caused it to malfunction and not produce as much pigment as it normally would. This is one reason why blonde hair is recessive, because essentially, the gene is not correct(but still is expressed, null mutation). Parent Bk: Black Haired Parent Bd: Blonde Haired Dark haired genes are dominant, meaning if your child gets one piece of a gene(s) from parent Bk that is(are) dominant, they will likely have or develop dark hair as the recessive gene(s) are overpowered. This is why some children are born with blonde or light hair that developes into dark brown/black as they age. Theoretically, Parent Bk would have to have a part of a blonde recessive gene(there are multiple genes but even one is enough) to give to a child in order for them to have blonde hair. Or, the gene(s) they receive from parent Bk malfunctions and the recessive gene(s) from parent Bd is(are) the only one(s) expressed making the kid blonde. The law of Segregation is a study proposed by Gregor Mendel while studying pea plants. He proposed that any one trait(phenotype) can be singled out and studied to produced offspring with planned traits. This is how we come about the Punnett Square, developed by Reginald Punnett, which is non disputed as the best method for determining gene expression in any one offspring. It begins with a 3:1 ratio, 3 offspring will have dominant expression while a fourth will be recessive. Testing this out on peat plants(something that can easily be replicated) found that the larger the sample size, the more the results averaged out to this 3:1 ratio. A small sample size such as children of two specific parents, may not express this 3:1 ratio but if the parent’s gametes are studied, you will find that it eventually devolves into this ratio. Because we don’t know for sure what alleles parent Bk has, you could end up with children who all have dark hair(not explicitly black but dark) or 50/50 dark/light If parent Bk has alleles that all function well, they will only pass on those alleles and since parent Bd only has poorly functioning alleles, they can only pass on those alleles. Almost always well functioning alleles will overpower the poorly functioning alleles but if parent Bk has a set of poorly functioning alleles then the odds of having a child with light hair increase dramatically. Parent Bk can pass on either well functioning or poorly functioning alleles and parent Bd can only pass on poorly functioning alleles. If child A gets poor alleles from both mom and dad, then they will almost certainly have light hair. If child B gets both good and poor alleles, they may start with light hair that develops into dark hair, or will only have dark hair. Because dark alleles are dominant and one parent has them, it is more likely you will have dark haired children, you may still have light haired children, but more will be dark. 480 Views   Ashley Grassano Answered Oct 5, 2017 You can read all the science about it, but here are my real-life examples: My grandmother was a natural blonde, my grandfather had jet black hair: My mother was blonde as a child, and it turned into what she called a “mousy brown” in her teens. My uncle always had jet black hair. My sister-in-law is a blonde and her husband has jet black hair: First born is blonde haired, blue eyed, fair skinned. He looks very much like my husband at that age, who was blonde as a child and now has dark brown hair. Husband and SIL’s folks were blonde/black hair combo as well. Second born has medium brown hair, light brown eyes, and is olive skinned. Neither parent is olive skinned, so that one came out of nowhere. Both kids have the same hair texture, thin and straight. I suspect #2’s hair will become black as he ages.

The eyebrows turned jet black during the same time. Second child was born with blonde hair and light brown eyebrows. Gradually, and during the teenage years, the blonde hair grew darker until it was a medium brown. The eyebrows grew to be a darker brown than the hair. Facial hair (male) was dark brown.

My younger sister inherited all these traits. My mother is of Northern European descent- fair-skinned with blonde hair and green eyes. I am fair-skinned with green eyes, but a redhead. No one on either side of my family, going back as many generations as anyone can remember, is a redhead. Yes, it is a recessive gene, but in this case, it’s recessive enough for me to feel like I might be the milkman’s daughter. At one holiday dinner, an aunt finally said, “Didn’t Uncle Ralph have red hair???” Having NEVER heard of an Uncle Ralph before, I asked who the hell Uncle Ralph was. Several family members started to say, “He did have red hair, didn’t he?” And then one family member informed me that Uncle Ralph (I suppose he would be my great uncle) had supposedly disappeared when they were all quite young, apparently having been kidnapped by The Mafia. Okay. Yeah. So naturally, I do not believe there was ever an “Uncle Ralph”, and I accused my family of all coming up with this story together to convince me that I am in fact related to all of them despite being the only ginger in the known family history. It is still an ongoing joke, and my family finds it hilarious that I continue to tell them that they did such a poor job with the fake Uncle Ralph story, that it only served to convince me that I am definitely secretly adopted. They still maintain that they are telling the truth about having a redheaded Uncle Ralph who disappeared leaving no proof of his existence, which is weird enough to make some part of me seriously still think I might just be adopted. But really, the point is, I’m probably not, hair genes are just crazy and complicated, and maybe there really was an Uncle Ralph who was the only other awkward ginger in my family. BUT nothing anyone says can convince me that he was kidnapped by The Mafia. Edit: Just to throw a little actual science in there to clarify for some people commenting, recessive genes must be inherited from both parents in order to be expressed. So, if a person has red hair, that means that both of their parents are carriers of the red hair gene. Doesn’t matter what color hair the parents have. That is a bit of a part of the joke. Both sides of my family have to have red hair down the line somewhere, yet out of all those people there just is no evidence of that until I was born. So it was a surprise. Hence the joke of me being adopted. Scientifically, though, it is totally understandable that it just hadn’t happened for many generations until me. Or maybe Uncle Ralph. ;) Also, my dad’s side of the family (the Portuguese) were especially surprised, maybe even a little upset, to find that some of them are apparently carriers of the “ginger gene”. Which I find hilarious. They need to brush up on the history of the people of Portugal. 11.9k Views · View Upvoters   Esther S , Mom to two since 2008; Auntie to many. Answered Oct 2, 2017 Hard to tell in general, but next to impossible without even knowing race. As some others have said, it varies depending on multiple genes that are all inherited differently. The single best way for a lay person to guess is to look at the homogeneity in each of the parents’ respective families. The more alike they all are, the more likely they are to have strong representation for that color in their genes. Then remember that most blonde genes are recessive, meaning that if a kid inherits blonde genes it will likely be overridden or modified (made darker) by any genes for other colors. Guesses for this situation based on race: If both are of W. European descent (British/German/French) they are most likely to have anything but black hair. Throw some Spanish, S. Italian, or Middl Eastern in there and the chances for black hair go up significantly. Northern European increases the chances of blonde or lighter brown hair. If the black hair is from an Asian parent, the same black hair is much more likely than anything else as Asian features tend to be pretty dominant over others. If the black hair is due to African descent… let’s just not go there, Africa has too much variation by region, and African-Americans are almost all of mixed white/black ancestry. In my own family (W. European), grandparents had black hair. Their 9 children had black(3), brown (1), blonde(2), and red(3). 1.1k Views · View Upvoters Quora User , Very genetically diverse Answered Oct 8, 2017 · Author has 5.8k answers and 38m answer views Well hey… those are my folks’ exact hair colors.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Eye Color  Genetics and Heredity  Eyes  Human Body  Personal Question If I have brown eyes, and my wife has blue eyes, what color eyes will our baby have? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 6 Answers   Adam Smith , studied at Royton and Crompton School Answered Sep 14, 2016 It depends if you have blue eyes in your family, whether any of your grandparents or parents have blue eyes. If so there is a bigger chance than if there aren’t any blue eyed people in your family, but even if there aren’t any blue eyed people in your family, there is a chance that your children could have blue eyes. This is because unlike previously thought blue eyes are NOT recessive and there are atleast 15 genes that contribute to eye colour, not two. This explains how blue eyed parents can have brown eyed children (which happens much more frequently than you may think). So with all of this in account it would be fairly hard to predict if you’r children will have blue eyes, even with your whole families eye colour and genetic records. Presuming both your parents and you have brown eyes I'd say there's a higher chance your child/children will have brown eyes. But in the end genetic inheritance is basically like a wheel of chance, you spin the wheel and whatever it lands on you get. 3.2k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below Can two brown-eyed people have a blue-eyed child?

Ask New Question   Mark Ross , studied at Fresno City College Answered Mar 30, 2018 · Author has 76 answers and 9k answer views Well, from a very primitive Medellian view, brown is dominant and blue is recessive. Two brown eyed parents can have children with any eye color (because their dominant brown possibly may be paired with a recessive blue). Two blue eyed parents can’t have a brown eyed child because to have blue eyes you must have two recessive genes. It’s my understanding however, that this is an over-simplified view of the genetic dance. There is more than one genetic component to eye color. So, although the information above holds true in most cases, there are times when two blue eyed parents CAN have a brown eyed child. Your kid, in short, could end up with virtually any color eyes. 288 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by 23andMe Explore your DNA with 23andMe.

Did either of your parents have blue eyes? You could have all brown eyed children or half of them could be blue eyed and the other half brown eyed. Blue eyes are a recessive trait which means that in order to have blue eyes you would need two copies of the blue eyed gene. So your wife having blue eyes has two copies of the blue gene and will pass it down to you children. Brown eyes are dominant which means that if you have one brown gene and one blue gene your eyes will still be brown. Therefore you might have two brown genes or one brown and one blue. If you have two brown genes then your children will all have one brown gene from you and one blue from your wife. In that case your children will all have brown eyes but your grandchildren could have blue eyes if your children married a blued eyed partner. However if you have one brown gene and one blue gene then half your children would get a blue gene from you and a blue gene from your wife and have blue eyes. The other half would get a brown from you and a blue from your wife and have brown eyes. 1.7k Views · View Upvoters   Nadine Rosenthal , studied Genetics and Heredity at Smith College (1983) Answered Apr 8, 2018 Your baby can have either blue or brown eyes as she is homozygous for blue and you can either be homozygous or heterozygous for brown.

If the situation is the former, there is a 50% chance the child will have blue eyes. If the situation is the latter, then the child will have a 25% chance of blue eyes. This can be explained by brown-eyed dominance. Dr. R. Renshaw 32 Views promoted  by Boomerang for Gmail Your personal AI assistant for writing better emails.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Blond Hair  Hair Color  Genetics and Heredity  Hair Is it possible that a blond child is born to non-blond (brunette or dark-haired) parents? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 8 Answers Anonymous Answered Jul 8, 2016 Yes it is. You have to remember that brown hair is dominant and blond hair is recessive. So we will now name brown hair ‘B’ and blonde hair ‘b’. If you mix these together, you of course will get a child with brown hair, because it is dominant. So this is B mixed with b. On the left you see 2 small ‘b’s. That is the mother (for example). On the top you see 2 capital letters ‘B’. That is for example the father. The 4 squares you see on the inside are the children. They have brown eyes. If one of these children will find a wife that also has the mother blue eyes, and the father brown eyes, it is possible to get a child with blue eyes. This is the new punnet square. On the left you see the mother aigain (the wife that child Bb just met) and on top you see child Bb. They get children together. People have 2 sex linked chromosomes, which are with child Bb now B & b. One of these you will pass on to your children. That is the same with your wife. If you both pass on your small letter b, you will get a child with blue eyes! if one of you passes on the small letter, and the other passes in the big letter your child will get brown eyes. But, it will be a carrier of the gene with blue eyes. So that child cán get a child with blue eyes! If you both pass on your capital letter B, your child will get brown eyes and it won’t ever get a child with blue eyes. So: if one of both of your parents have blue eyes, then: 25 % change on a child with blue eyes 50 % change on a child with brown eyes, but it will be a carrier of blue eyes. 25 % change on brown eyes and it won’t get a child with blue eyes. if only one of you guys have a parent or grandparent with blue eyes, you won’t be getting a child with blue eyes.

Back in the (seriously) olden days, women used to try to bleach their locks with everything from horse urine to pigeon dung. (We don't recommend you try that at home.)  Whether you come by your blonde hair "legally" or make that faithful appointment with your stylist every 6-8 weeks, here's what you need to know about this preternaturally playful hair color.   1. Being naturally blonde is pretty rare. Only 2 percent of people in the world are natural blondes . (About 1 in 20 Americans.) But that doesn't mean it's not popular. One in three women dye their locks light enough to be blonde.  2. Blonde hair comes from a teeny-tiny genetic mutation. How tiny? Think one letter change among 3 billion letters that make up your DNA .  3. Blondes aren't blondes forever. (Naturally, at least.) Many kids born with light hair go dark before their tenth birthday, thanks to rising levels of eumelanin, a natural pigment that regulates the darkness of hair strands.  4. Having blonde hair doesn't necessarily mean you have blue eyes.  It's a stereotype . Although red hair and light eyes and light skin DO tend to go together, blondies can have eyes that are blue, green, brown, etc.  5. There are 50 shades of gray ... and 30 shades of blonde. Yep, there are really that many hues that can be considered blonde . Seriously. For instance, Taylor Swift has café au lait locks; Gwen Stefani's are golden platinum; and Cara Delevingne rocks a gray blonde. (Beyonce's a "brownde" -- a brownish-blonde -- just FYI.)  More from The Stir:  Going Platinum Blonde Is Easy With These 4 Expert Tips (PHOTO)  6. Blond-haired, blue-eyed men are blondes' biggest fans. The reason has roots in evolutionary psychology. Both blonde hair and blue eyes are recessive traits, so BOTH parents must have them to pass on to their kids. Scientists think men with light hair and eyes are instinctively drawn to women with the same coloring. That way, he'll know for sure he's the dad of any offspring.  7. Blondes not only have more fun -- they have MORE hair. Most people have about 120,000 hairs on their head, but people with light-colored locks have even more. The reason? Blonde hair is finer than other colors, so the scalp can "hold" more.  8. Gentlemen (probably do) prefer blondes. Several published studies have found that men find blondes more attractive than women with other hair colors. Blonde women are most likely to be picked up in a bar. Heck, they're also more likely to be helped by a man when they drop something on a sidewalk.  More from The Stir : 10 Intriguing Scientific Facts About Redheads  9. But there's a dark side to men's attraction, too. Research published in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology found that men think blondes are usually needy, high-maintenance, and neurotic . (So, stop trying to pick us up in bars already then!)  10. Forget "dumb blonde" -- blondes make men act dumb. ...Although not for the reasons you might think. When French men were shown pics of blonde women, then given a general knowledge test, they did worse on it than when they looked at images of dark-haired women. The reason? Researchers say the stereotype of "dumb blonde" is so ingrained that men were simply behaving in kind. Oookay , OR they're just dumbfounded by our beauty!  11. But blondes get the last laugh! Researchers at the University of Queensland found that not only are blonde women paid more than their peers with other hair colors, but they're also more likely to marry a wealthier man .

Dominant vs. Recessive          Back to Dominant vs. Recessive           English   Español       Both parents have brown eyes and brown hair. They have twins and one has brown hair and blue eyes while the other have blonde hair and blue eyes. Which features are dominant and how do you know?        -An undergraduate from the UK   August 29, 2013  This is a great question! From a first pass we would conclude that blue eyes and blonde hair are recessive.  Unfortunately we’d be wrong about the blonde hair (and only partly right about eye color).  The way you figure out if a trait is dominant or recessive is you look for patterns.  As I’ll explain in more detail later, if a trait is recessive, then it can appear even if both parents don’t have that trait.  Another way to tell if a trait is recessive is if both parents and all their kids share that same trait.  In our case here, both parents have brown eyes but they had a blue-eyed child.  So this follows the first pattern meaning blue eyes are recessive.  The same would be true for blonde hair.  Both parents had brown hair but they had a child with blonde hair.  As I said, though, we’d be wrong.  It turns out that eye color and most hair colors are way too complicated to be simple dominant/recessive traits.  Surprisingly, blue-eyed parents sometimes have a brown-eyed child .  Now this isn’t that common so we could still say that blue eyes are mostly recessive.  The same isn’t really true for blonde hair.  Blonde parents often have darker haired children (or even redheads).  This is why you can’t just look at a single family to figure this stuff out.  You need to look at lots and lots of families and lots and lots of kids.  Only then do you have a chance at figuring out if a trait is dominant or recessive.  For example, imagine that in our case both kids had brown eyes.  We might conclude that brown eyes are recessive because all the parents and kids had the same eye color.   But this is not at all correct.  If you only look at one example you can miss the right answer!  In fact this is where the wrong ideas about attached ear lobes, rolling your tongue and lots of other supposedly simple dominant and recessive traits came from.  Scientists jumped to the wrong conclusion from studying too few families.  One of the big reasons why blonde hair and blue eyes (and all those other traits) fail as true recessives is that they are not due to a single gene.  And truly recessive traits almost always involve a single gene.  Of course just because a single gene is involved doesn’t mean you’ll for sure have a clear dominant or recessive pattern. The ABO blood type is a great example of this.  For the rest of the answer I want to focus on why dominant and recessive traits follow the patterns I’ve described.  And why being due to more than one gene can disrupt the whole thing.   Why Patterns Work  As I mentioned it would be pretty easy to answer this question if blonde hair and blue eyes were due to a single gene.  Let’s see why.  For this, we’ll focus on a dominant trait that really is due to a single gene—the ability to taste Phenylthiocarbamide or PTC .  PTC is a bitter tasting chemical similar to one found in broccoli and brussel sprouts that three out of every four people can taste.  With this trait, two parents who can’t taste PTC rarely have a child that can taste it.  And sometimes parents who can taste PTC have a child that can’t taste it.  This fits our patterns meaning that the ability to taste PTC is a dominant trait (and not being able to taste is a recessive one).  Let’s dig a bit deeper to see why.  There are two versions of the gene that determines if you can taste PTC—T and t.  The T version lets you taste PTC and the t version does not.  Another name for these two different versions of the same gene are alleles.  Whether or not a person can taste PTC depends on which alleles of the gene they have.  If this is all there was then it would be very hard to see why tasters even had nontasters.  To understand that, we need to know that people have two copies of each gene. They get one copy from their mom and one from their dad.  If a person gets two copies of the T allele (so their genotype is TT), then it is clear that they will be able to taste PTC.  The same idea holds true if they get two copies of the t allele.  In this case they will be tt and so not be able to taste PTC.  However, if a person gets one copy of the T allele, and one of the t allele, it turns out they can still taste PTC.  This means that tasting PTC (the T allele) is dominant because if you get a single copy from either parent you show that version of the trait. In other words, these carriers can taste PTC.  The opposite is true for not being able to taste PTC (the t allele). It is recessive, as it will be hidden whenever a person has a T copy of the gene.  So the only combination that will cause a person to NOT be able to taste PTC is when they have two copies of the t allele (tt).  Now we are almost ready to explain why nontaster parents rarely have a taster child and why taster parents sometimes have a child that can’t taste PTC.  The last piece of the puzzle we need is that each parent passes just one of their alleles to his or her child.  And that allele is chosen at random.  Now we are ready to see where the patterns come from.  We’ll do this by looking at three different scenarios.  First, let’s imagine two nontaster parents.  Here is what this might look like genetically:    First off, you can see that both parents are tt.  This is the definition of a nontaster.  Remember each child will get one allele from mom and one from dad.  Since the parents can only pass a t, all the kids are guaranteed to be tt.  None of them will be able to taste PTC.  This is why parents with a recessive trait have children with recessive traits too*.  Now let’s look at two tasters who happen to be TT:    Again, they only have one allele they can pass down…in this case a T.    This means all their kids will be TT and so will be able to taste PTC.  Finally, let’s look at two tasters that carry a hidden nontaster allele.  As you can see, both parents are Tt:    In this case, if both mom and dad happen to pass their t to their child, then the child will be tt.  That child will not be able to taste PTC.  But of course these parents don’t have to have a child that can’t taste PTC.  In fact, each child only has a 25% chance of ending up a nontaster.  This is why we have to look at lots and lots of families to figure out if a trait is recessive or dominant.  In one family, taster parents may have all taster kids even if the parents were carriers.  This would make being a taster look like a recessive trait even though it isn’t.  Again we see the importance of looking at lots and lots of families.   *Even this isn’t 100% for PTC.  Occasionally parents who can’t taste PTC have a child that can.  There are a number of ways this can happen but most of the time, these parents would have a child who can’t taste PTC.   Different Patterns  We won’t have time to go into it here, but if there are multiple genes involved, these patterns can break down pretty quickly.  Click here for an example of this with eye color and here for one with blood type.  When we look at lots of families for eye color, we see a pattern that sort of looks like blue eyes are recessive and brown are dominant.  But we also see the more than occasional blue eyed parents having a brown eyed child.  And we aren’t even throwing in green and hazel and everything else!  Hair color is an even bigger mess.  If we look at enough families, we tend to see lots of blending.  A dark haired parent and a light haired parent will often have a child with a color in between.  Black + Blonde = Brown!  So all in all the answer to your question is neither!  Blonde hair, brown hair, blue eye, browns eyes …none of those traits are dominant or recessive as they are not due to a single gene.  Which in a lot of ways is a good thing because multi-gene traits allow for all of the wonderful variation we see around us!

Im a natural blonde and people are always accusing me of bleaching my hair because blondes usually have blue or green eyes...      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Glider    306            Glider    306    C.Psychol.

Hazel is only a shade from green. Are you light or dark blonde?      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Jasmin    10            Jasmin    10    Quark       Members    10   20 posts             Posted June 16, 2004        I have light blonde hair...my features used to be darker when I was little but my eyes and hair got lighter as I got older but from far away my eyes look brown, you can only see the green in them up close...      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 jgerlica    10            jgerlica    10    Atom       Senior Members    10   237 posts             Posted June 17, 2004        Do you happen to live near high tension lines or a nuclear power plant?      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Jasmin    10            Jasmin    10    Quark       Members    10   20 posts             Posted June 17, 2004        yea I do actually...and I take baths in glowing green gunge...      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 jgerlica    10            jgerlica    10    Atom       Senior Members    10   237 posts             Posted June 17, 2004        I thought so      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Glider    306            Glider    306    C.Psychol.

In genetics, anything is possible. It's all a probablity thing.    I myself am black, Irish, Native American, and West Indian. I have caramel skin, brown hair with light brown highlights with a red tint, and eyes that deside what color they want to be ranging from brown to light brown to hazel. I guess you have to look into your background :::scientist side of me kicking in::: if you are able to get a good background on yourself, you may even be able to do a semi-accurate dihybrid cross on yourself. Have fun:)      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Guest mestabolite            Guest mestabolite          Guests             Posted October 29, 2004        Hey guys happy you discussing this, I have notice than from all my friends that recently had kids, where one of the parents have brown eyes and the other blue eyes, the kids all have BLUE EYES, as you know Bb (B=Brown, b=blue) Brown is a dominant gene and in general most of them should have brown eyes.

By the time I was in high school, it was "paper bag brown" .  It was also really oily and always looked dirty.  I started "frosting it" to improve the color and also to dry it out some.  I was ever so glad when foiling was invented.  It was torture to have long hair pulled through a cap with crochet hooks.    Cut to the chase - I was born blonde with hazel eyes.      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Sorcerer    34            Sorcerer    34    Molecule       Senior Members    34   1104 posts   Location:  New Zealand              Posted January 16, 2005        Hey guys happy you discussing this, I have notice than from all my friends that recently had kids, where one of the parents have brown eyes and the other blue eyes, the kids all have BLUE EYES, as you know Bb (B=Brown, b=blue) Brown is a dominant gene and in general most of them should have brown eyes. Has anyone else notice this?    This means the parents are bb and Bb and that means the grandparents are xb xb and Bx xb where x is unknown, so the parents of the brown eye parent were blue and brown heterozygous.    Every child has an independant chance for blue eyes with every "trial" (fertilisation), so to having mulitple children with blue eyes shouldnt be any less rare for these parents as just one with blue eyes.

Especially with all the people of mixed races. I myself am japanese and german. and for some reason beyond any known every damn person in my family has brown eyes and dark hair, and they all have glasses, everyone, even the german side. ME on the other hand, i naturally have this odd dull brown/ blonde colour, and i have bluish green eyes and above 30/20 vision. I cant explain it, no one cares to, the point is, i am living proof of how screwed up genetic possibilities can be. so it wouldnt surprise me if you started to see black people with red hair and freckles, and if you saw the whitest person youve ever seen with asian eyes and a dark black afro. to be honest, if i saw an umpa-loompa from willy wonka i wouldnt be surprised. espesscially in canada where if anywhere youll find someone who has a part of some other culture you wouldnt expect.      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Guest kiyoshi            Guest kiyoshi          Guests             Posted May 30, 2005        actually, just to add something, if you take keanu reeves for example, he is like 1/4 japanese, 1/4 hawaiian, 1/2 english, now if you look at him he has brown hair, brown eyes, and if you look at the matrix has like blonde chest hair? would someone care to explain that?!?! cause that just confuzes the hell out of me.      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Mag    12            Mag    12    Atom       Senior Members    12   270 posts   Location:  Arizona              Posted May 30, 2005        well it is independant but you're statistics are a bit rusty' date=' its much less likely to have multiple children with blue eyes   chances of one blue eyed child: 1:2  chances of two blue eyed childs: 1:4  chances of three blue eyed childs: 1:8  chances of four blue eyed childs: 1:16  chances of five blue eyed childs: 1:32[/quote']    you sure about those ^    if i remember correctly the chance of ONE blue eyed child was more like 1:4 or more.

You never know, genetics are a crazy thing! I hope you get exactly what you want! Good luck mama! e  eeek23 @nz0525  Even at birth it's not set in stone. My twins came out with dark brown hair and bright blue eyes. Dh and I both are brown hair brown eyes but we have blonde hair and blue eyes on both sides of our family so we weren't that shocked . My twins are 18 months now and they have dark brown eyes and light brown / dirty blonde hair. Never count on baby's features staying the same after birth. It might happen but it's unlikely. And most people who have brown eyes were born with blue and they turn brown in the first. 6 months. It took about 4 months for my girls' eyes to turn brown and it happened over night. :) your baby can look like anything momma and even at birth it's not 100% that those will be baby's features.

If not you child should have brown eyes. If either one of your grandparents passed a recessive trait for blue eyes down to your parents your baby could have a 50/50 chance between brown or blue eyes. m  mamataylor14 @ataylor036  My paternal grandfather has blue eyes and my maternal grandmother has blue eyes and both of his grandparents have blue c  crazylove_bells This is so fun...I could make a guess, but it would probably have no scientific significance lol!  My husband is 1/2 Filipino- dark features and brown eyes... and I'm a blondie with green eyes...our baby came out blond at first lol!  She now has very light brown hair and kept her BLUE eyes! Beautiful with almond shaped eyes :) Ok my guess for your baby...dirty blonde hair with blue eyes! You'll have to keep us updated once baby arrives :) m  mamataylor14 @crazylove_bells  That's awesome! I bet she's beautiful! A friend of mine is African American and her baby came out with bright icy blue eyes! Crazy :) and so pretty! j  jlyons02 Punnett square.. you have to line up you and your DH, but you need to know what traits are dominant and what's recessive.. I know green eyes are recessive so I have 2 recessive genes, and my SO has brown eyes, which is dominant, so our baby will most likely have brown eyes, unless my SO has 1 dominant brown trait and one recessive green, in which case there is 1/4 chance of green eyes. z  zmomma2 I have no idea. But I'm a red head and everyone told me there was no way id get my red headed baby because the gene is so recessive. Well, my girl has a head full of bright red curly hair!! She also has daddy's big brown eyes, which is a rare combination :) She's a pretty even split between all of our features, so I'm curious about number 2! b  blessedmomma12 @mamataylor14  I'm brown/brown and DH is brown/hazel. Our DD has beautiful dark auburn/red hair and blue eyes! Dark eyelashes unlike many lighter red heads. Never would've guessed we'd get a red head bc no parents/grandparents. A couple random great aunts/uncles apparently had red. We love our sweet surprise! G  GiraffeGirl Bb/BB = Brown eyes always bb= Blue Eyes always a person with bb can only produce gametes with "b" a person with BB can only produce gametes with "B" a person with Bb produces gametes with "B" OR "b"  your DH can only produce "b", so your child definitely has at least one "b" i believe that you having hazel eyes is the same genetically as having blue eyes, therefore you only produce "b" as well, which means that your parents are each Bb. so....you are having a blue eyed little one :) k  kwitt318 I think... blue eyes are recessive gene. However with that many you may end up with a blue eyed babe! I believe curly is recessive too, so unless you had curly its unlikely babe will have curly!  I would aim to guess brown hair, but its just a guess! G  GiraffeGirl @GiraffeGirl  to correct myself a bit...genetics refer to "light" and "dark" eyes.  If your eyes are light, you are having a blue eyed baby.  I know people who call their eyes "hazel" but they are really brown. j  jennigiddi @mamataylor14  I don't know the whole dominant recessive thing but I can tell you what I have. I have brown hair now, blonde as a child and hazel eyes. My mom had hazel my dad blue. My husband is 1/2 Japanese so he has dark hair brown eyes. His dad had blue. Our 3 oldest all ended up with blonde hair blue eyes. I do expect their hair to darken through the years. My youngest ended up with the brown eyes and dark hair. Kind of curious to see what this one ends up having. I would've liked 1 to get my eyes. :) c  candicel125 My husband is blue, I'm brown. All 3 of our boys are blue :) m  mamataylor14 These are what I call hazel haha they seem light to me so maybe these with my DG blue eyes we will have a blue eyes girl! :) H  Haleigh4512 Ok mines crazy difficult.

I guess you just never know until they come :)) G  GiraffeGirl @mamataylor14  what beautiful eye balls you have!!!  :)) i would say they are brown from a genetic standpoint....so, you have at least one "B".  you could have a "b" and therefore a blue eyed LO, otherwise, s/he will be "Bb" and beautifuly brown eyed.  :) s  svtbaby Is this applicable to just color of eyes/hair or even kind of hair like curly, wavy or straight?

They had 5 children, all the girls have blonde hair and a form of blue eyes, dark blue, grey blue and mine are green blue. My brother has brown hair, and honey brown eyes. My other brother passed at 2, but I'm assuming his hair would have changed to brown, and he had very dark chocolate eyes. 2 of my siblings tan very very well, and I turn pink lol. I have freckles.

You: blue eyes so you will give blue/blue, DH: brown eyes with a blue eyed parent so he will give blue/brown. Possible combinations are Blue (from you)/blue (from DH)=blue Blue (from you)/brown (from DH)=brown y  yesallmine Here's our make up... DH= blue eyes(his mom and dad, blue eyes) Me= brown eyes(my dad blue, my mom brown) 5 of our kids have blue eyes and 2 have brown eyes Your kids could go either way. I will say that my blue eyed babies were much bluer at birth than my brown eyed babies(their eyes were much darker). m  menmybump You can only know for certain what clue eyes your baby will have if you both have blue eyes as that means you both got blue eye genes from both your parents and therefore you can both only pass on blue eye genes. To have blue eyes you have to get blue eye genes from both parents, as Brown is a stronger gene and will win out If your husband has brown eyes but his father has blue eyes then he got a blue eye gene from his father (since his father must have 2 blue eyes genes that's all he could pass on) and a brown eye gene from his mum which won over the blue eyed gene. since you have blue eyes that's the only gene you can pass on but your husband can pass on either so you'll just have to wait and see, and then blame him if it not what you were hoping for :) p  piperchapman My DH and I both have brown hair and hazel eyes and my kid has blond hair, blue eyes. We get a lot of mail man jokes. Since most of both our family's eyes are brown with the random blue or green here and there, I'd say your chances are pretty good for a blue eyed baby... but even if he/she doesn't get the blue gene, I think brown eyes are absolutely gorgeous. T  TipToeTulip72 I have brown eyes & DH has green. DS has blue & DD has brown. My dad had blue eyes & DHs sister & grandpa have blue eyes so it seems like ds got the recessive trait while dd got the more dominant.

I would guess brown eyes with brown curly hair!  How fun... Curly hair is soooo cute!  I'm so glad I can put my genetics classes to use here!  I just took a genetics class last semester :) H  Heidimelt @ebby8890  If any of your grandparents have blue eyes then there is a chance you may have the gene but if not then there would only be about a 1% chance of your child having light eyes. If you have only brown (BB) genes to give and your husband has blue (bb) no matter what you would give a (B) and he would give a (b) so baby would have (Bb) and the B=brown would be dominant. Hair can be a little more tricky so could go either way. My husband has black hair and brown eyes and I have blonde and blue, but since his grandma had blonde hair with blue eyes he had the blue eye gene and our son has light hair and eyes. Hope this makes sense. e  ebby8890 @Heidimelt  There has to be the blue eye gene somewhere in my grandparents because my uncle has blonde hair an blue eyes even though my Grandma an grandpa have brown eyes. Im pretty sure my first daughter has hazel eyes but its hard to tell forsure. m  masonsmyworld @ebby8890  If your uncle is blond haired and blue eyed and you're sure that your grandma was faithful (just joking) then your parent (whomever's brother is your uncle) has a 1/4 chance of being a heterozygous (carrier) of the blue eyes AND blond hair. Which means that you would being a brown eyed and brown hair woman (assuming your other parent is not also a carrier of one or both) 1/16 chance of being a carrier for BOTH. And if your hubby is blond and blue eyed you'd have a 1/64 chance of having a blond haired blue eyed baby. That being said, the chances of you having a child that is brown haired and blue eyed is a little different but still up there in low percentages. So if I had to guess, your child will most likely be brown haired, brown eyes and curly hair. Which sounds adorable to me. I could continue to do the math but it's late and pregnancy brain isn't great at this time of night. BTW, great question... that was fun. B  Baby3dueAug14 @masonsmyworld  What a great reply masonsmyworld! Do me!! I have brown hair and blue/green (hazel) eyes. My hubby is blonde and blue eyes. Our two sons are blonde and blue eyes too. I have heard brown hair and eyes are dominate. I do have the blonde/blue gene in my family though. One sister has my hair and eyes. My other sister is blonde and blue. Both my mom and dad are brown and blue. Both grandmother's are brown and either hazel or blue. Both grandfathers blonde and blue. So I'm a little curious what my little girl will have!! It could totally be either way. Though, I can't think of a single person in my family or my husband's family with brown eyes so I'm thinking that's out. I'm more puzzled if she'll have blonde or brown hair. How do you calculate the odds for each?!? R  Rica08152011 Lol... I felt like I was in biology 101 all over again w/ all this talk about dominant/recessive alleles homozygous/heterozygous... And genotype...love it! Anyway, I agree w/ everyone, not knowing your full history that your baby will be Brown/Brown. e  ebby8890 @Rica08152011  If someone asked me about snake genetics I could probably answer but human babies? nah lol A  Allyceo15 I'm interested to see my baby... My side has: Mom-brown hair and eyes Dad brown hair , hazel eyes Brother brown hair n eyes Moms parents both brown hair and eyes Dads mom blonde and blue, grandpa brown amd hazel My uncle is blonde and blue DF is brown and green His brother blonde n blue and sister brown and brown His parents brown and brown, and then his mom is brown n brown d  dragonflii @maggiesue2011  Ooo! Guess mine please! =D DF and I both have actual hazel eyes (as in they change color). My Mom and Dad both had brown eyes, I got my eyes from my maternal grandmother. DF's Mom has blue eyes and his Dad has hazel green, ( i do not know if they change color). I'm pretty sure our baby will have dark hair as we both do. But, what do you think the chances of passing on our hazel eyes? I would really hate it if my parent's brown eyes popped back up! I love our eyes!Â J  Jelly09 @ebby8890  All right people, a lot of you have a great understanding of simple (Mendelian) genetics, but human genetics are often far more complex than what is taught in high school or even a university undergraduate biology course. So I'm a cell biologist/geneticist and I think the key point that is missing in this discussion is that the simple genes people "learned" for eye color in past classes are pretty much just made up. While it does seems to be true that brown eyes are dominant to blue eyes, there seem to be way more than just one or two genes that are involved in eye color (there could be ten or more, we just don't know yet), so right now it is really really hard to predict what eye color one's offspring might have. My DH is a cell biologist as well (both PhDs) and we have both been somewhat surprised with DS's green eyes given that DH's are hazel brown (all his family is brown) and my whole family has blue eyes. But it's a fun game, and we talk about things like this all the time. We're still wondering if one of our kiddos will end up with my red hair, as DH's family is all dark haired, but my two blonde parents had two red-headed kids (my mom's mom was red while her dad was dark-haired, but my two uncles are red!). So far DS appears to be a medium colored brown... who knows! I think human genetics for a lot of these traits are just more complex than we've figured out yet. There are a lot of other traits that we can predict from just the parents (and sometimes grandparents/aunts/uncles/siblings), like the ability to roll one's tongue, blood type, or certain genetic diseases. I'd be happy to chat more about genetics with anyone though, it's really one of my favorite things! I know that makes me such a nerd, but I find it fun because it's a real logic puzzle. p  princess212 @ebby8890  the darker hair and eyes are always dominant my son has a lighter brown hair even though me and hubby have very dark brown and he has even darker then my brown eyes and hubby has blue.  But my best friend is dark hair dark eyes and had a baby with a black guy so obviousy dark skin hair and eyes and her daughter has the most amazing blue eyes you have ever seen and what looks like just a perfectly tanned skin.  So anything really can happen m  masonsmyworld @Baby3dueAug14  So sorry, I just got onto the actual site rather than my phone, so I am just now seeing this. The fact that you have blue/green eyes and that your hubby has blue eyes means that you're little girl will definitely have blue eyes with a slight possibility of the green tint you got. Green is really rare! So jealous, I always wanted green eyes but I got grey ;) Since your parents are both brown haired, but they had a blondie, means that they have to both be heterozygous for the blonde hair color, which means that there was a 25% chance that you could be purely homozygous (BrBr) for brown hair and a 50% chance that you are heterozygous for (BrBl). Since your hubby is blonde he is obviously homozygous (BlBl) as blonde is recessive. That means when you two pair up there is a 50% chance you will have a blonde haired baby. Out of curiosity were you a blondie when you were younger? n  nestingtwo @masonsmyworld  Check out my eye color thread I just posted with a chart to show you the probability of eye  color. :) I posted this with my last pregnancy and it was fun to see all the variations! m  masonsmyworld @Jelly09  oh, I know I simplified it way too much. But like you mentioned, its fun to guess and having had 6 ( I study the biology of cancer, so lots of genetics but I'm no phd) years of genetics its a pretty educated guess ;) though I know mother nature can always throw us for a loop.

It depends on the parents. It should be about 3 out of 16 times, if the parents are heterogeneous for both traits. If both parents have blonde hair, you are certain to be blonde. It is hard to tell with the eyes to know if both parents carry a recessive gene or not. But there is more than genotype to consider here. In this case, if the genes in question determine melanin-making capacity, then this would actually be impossible, since melanin is needed both for eye and hair color. It that case, they might end up with green eyes (blue eyes with a layer of theomelanin).   1 person  found this useful                       Svheia  28 Contributions      What is the likelihood of having a blue-eyed baby with blond hair if the mother and father both have blue eyes with brown hair that was blond from birth-6 years old?  blue eyes very likely, blond hair, not lucky- will turn out brown as brown hair is the dominant allele in a brown-blond pair of alleles (see genetics, hair color, wikipedia).  Hi, no I don't agree because I have brown hair now but I was properly blond til I was 6 years old. Both my parents had brown hair. I am English (and by that I mean properly English - not muslim) and like 90% of ethnically English people, have blond hair when young that darkens with age. This is due to the English race being Germanic and related to the Germans, Danes, Norwegians etc. In the US, there are lots of people with either English or German ancestry - so much the same story there too.   I do not know about English race, ancestors and genetic traits, nor the genetic background of the darkening blond hair, however if both parents have brown hair, it means that they carry at least one dominant gene that expresses brown hair. Still, if both parent have also one recessive allele for blond hair, theoretically there is a 25% chance that their children could be blond haired, and of course with blue eyes.               Bryce223  84 Contributions      Boy had blond hair as a child but he now has dark brown with green eyes girl had brown hair but now has blonde with brown eyes what colour eyes and hair will the baby have?

Snitzo123  194 Contributions      What colour of eyes and hair will the baby have if the mother has green eyes and blonde hair and the father has green eyes and brown hair?  Most likely the baby will have blue+green mix and you wont know until the baby grows hair it could be any colour but by Mother has blonde hair green eyes and father has brown hair green eyes the baby would probably have dark blonde hair               Mrbc101  3 Contributions      What is the chances of a couple with brown eyes and brown hair having a blond hair and green eyed baby?  It's absolutely possible, and I am living proof of it. The chances are extremely slim though, because both the trait for blond hair and the traits for green eyes are recessive.   Green eyes are the rarest eye color, because green eyes are not only recessive to the brown eyes trait but also recessive even to blue eyes. I couldn't give exact odds, because the process of genetic recombination is random, but if both traits existed somewhere earlier in the family line, (one parent or more is a carrier) then the combination is not impossible. Even with blond haired people, most tend to exhibit either blue eyes or brown because of green's recessiveness to the two. Having the most recessive eye color trait and the second rarest hair color in the world appear together in one person is exceptionally rare though, but still possible.               Teledain  4,388 Contributions      Your boyfriend has brown hair and hazel eyes and you have blonde hair and brown eyes what color eyes and hair will your baby have?  The possible hair colors are:    brown, blond, auburn, red, strawberry blond    This is because your boyfriend has more than just a "brown" gene; it's just that the other genes aren't expressed because brown is dominant.    The possible eye colors are:    brown, green, blue, hazel    Again this is because both of you have more than just the expressed gene, and your baby may have a combination of genes from each of you that are not expressed but still present.    Statistically, it's slightly more likely the baby will have brown eyes and brown hair--but it shouldn't be surprising at all if the baby has any of the other hair and eye colors.               Swit adi  7 Contributions      If a man had blue eyes and black hair and the woman had blue eyes blond hair There child came out to be blond hair and brown eyes?  It can't be. The blue eyes gene is recessive! to have blue eyes youmust get the TWO RECESSIVE gens from your parents: aa . brown eyes gene is dominant (AA or Aa). So if the two parents haveblue eyes, their children, their children will be blue eyed aswell. aa and aa can't create Aa or AA.            If a man had black hair and blue eyes and the woman had blond hair blue eyes can the child come out with brown eyes blond hair if the grandmother had brown eyes?  Blue eyes are a recessive trait. If at least one of the parents had a blue/hazel eyes with a mixture of blue and brown, then the couple's offspring could have brown eyes. If both parents had solid blue eyes, neither would have the dominant brown gene to pass to the baby, and it would have blue eyes, regardless of the grandmother's eye color.               MeetRosie  3 Contributions      If you have brown hair and brown eyes and your boyfriend has brown hair and brown eyes what are the chances that your kid would have blonde hair and blue eyes?  This is unlikely since brown eyes are a dominant gene and so is brown hair. Blonde hair and blue eyes are a recessive gene.  If one of your parents have blue eyes/brown hair, or one of his, then there is still a chance you will have a child with blonde hair and blue eyes.  If both of you have a parent with blonde hair and blue eyed, there is actually a 25% chance of having a child with this combination.  If not, the chances are much less.  However, it isn't possible to know whether your genotype (the actual traits one carries) contains this trait since it isn't a dominant trait and doesn't necessarily manifest itself in the individual.               Teledain  4,388 Contributions      If both parents have brown hair and eyes can there baby have blond hair and blue eyes?  Yes, if the parents are brown-blond for hair (which will appear brown because it is dominant over blond), the baby can get one blond from each parent and be blond-blond (which will appear blond). Similar, if the parents are brown-blue for eyes (which will appear brown because it is dominant over blue), the baby can get one blue from each parent and be blue-blue (which will appear blue).               Phillips313  1 Contribution      How will you know what color eyes and hair will your baby haveif the father has brown hair and brown eyes and the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes?  \nbrown eyes are dominant over blue eyes. hair colors can mix, or be one or the other. for both, you need to go further back in both your gene pools for more evidence.               Down123  1 Contribution      What color eyes and hair will a baby have if the father has black hair and brown eyes and the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes?  Thats EXACTLY me! My parents have that. I have tanned skin, green/hazel eyes & black hair.            What color hair and eyes will your baby have the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes and the father has brown hair and green eyes?  it will probably have dirty blonf hair or a light brown hair colour and probably blueish green eyes but its hard to b sure               Akiko Fujishima  22 Contributions      How can your baby have blonde hair and blue eyes when the mother has brown hair and hazel eyes and the father has brown hair air and brown eyes?  Genetics is quite tricky. Traits from family members many generations past can show up in the child of a mother with brown hair and eyes, and father having brown hair and hazel eyes. Many times, the child's hair and eyes will darken as they get older. From a personal experience, I had attended school with a boy that had both pale blond hair and blue eyes. By the time he was 12, his hair was very dark brown and he had brown eyes. I think humans tend to think only the parents have an effect on the genetics of a child.. but that just is not the case. There have also been findings in two, thought to be, Caucasian parents having a child with very dark skin... they way genetics work is completely unpredictable.               Maxiogee  32,371 Contributions      If a mother and father both had brown hair and brown eyes what are the odds that they would have two blond hair blue eyed children?  \nLight hair and eye colour are what is known as 'recessive' - that is, one can carry the gene for them and yet not have them. These can then be passed on to children. If two children have the same features then it is likely that both parents are carrying the recessive genes. "Recessive" just means that someone in the person's ancestry had these hair and eye colour. Blue eyes often accompany blond hair.               Cathy Weldon  25 Contributions      What color eyes and hair will a baby have if the father has blond hair and blue eyes and the mother has black hair and dark brown eyes?  the eyes wont be as dark but there is only a one out of three chance they will be green or blue. the hair is probably going to be a shade of brown               Redbaronpizza  10 Contributions      What color hair will the baby have if the father has dark brown hair and brown eyes and the mother has blond hair and green eyes?  It really depends if the baby will look more like the mother or more like the father. Who knows, maybe it will have brown hair green eyes!            I have really pale skin strawberry-golden blonde hair and bright blue eyes but I hate them and I beacuase they look too bright I want to get brown contacts will these look odd on me?  I wish I had that kind of complection embrace your looks you probably look gorgeous, brown eyes are really boring ive always wishes that I could have blue eyes, they look so clear and beautiful.

There are several pages on the WWW that can help you to determine the probability of your unborn child eye colors.\n.

Many men find blond hair blue eyed females attractive, vice versa; it represents a presence of innocence and cuteness (this is because the blue eyes stand out!)               Myguyroxs  35 Contributions      You have red hair hazel eyes and your boyfriend has brown hair brown eyes but your daughter has very blonde hair and blue eyes How is this possible?  well somewhere down your family tree or his family tree there is proubuly a couple of people who have blonde hair and blue eyes, like my BF has blonde hair and her mom dad and sibblings have brown so it is all with genes.               Lisamc57  22,380 Contributions      I have blonde hair and brown eyes but my dad is naturally dark haired would brown suit me as i am blonde and have brown eyes?  I would say yes.. 
Because of your own rown eyes I would say yes. But I wouldn't go dark. You should get some brown low lights and see how you feel before you dye all your hair.               Shannonjenkins1  5 Contributions      If you have blue eyes and blond hair and you dye your hair brown can it change the color of you eyes?  No, It's impossible, Your eyes will always stay the same colour even iff you've dyed your hair black to ginger! So don't worry you'll keep your blue eyes!!               Sam c jones  2,330 Contributions      What are the chances of a baby having blond hair and blue eyes if the father has black hair and brown eyes and the mother has black hair and hazel eyes?  Unfortunately very slim. It all depends on your background. If any of you have had blood relatives who have had either of these traits, it is possible.   However, if not then the chances are extremely rare, maybe even unlikely.. 
another answer... this can occur from ones grandparents genes as their genes may still be with ones parents even if their hair and eyes are unalike in colour. Or theres a milkman involved               Saskia Zaal  34 Contributions      What color hair and eye will a baby have if the father has strawberry blonde hair and brown eyes and the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes?  It will have no eyes. So there!   The child probably will have a lighter haircolour, and it can have both brown eyes and blue eyes,            How come your dad has blue eyes blond hair mom has hazel brown eyes and one brother has blue eyes blond hair and the other has green eyes blond hair why do you have brown hair and dark brown eyes?  I don't know how much you know about genes, but there are dominant genes and recessive genes, and you only get two genes (a person could get two dominants or two recessives or one dominant and one recessive). 
To explain it better, here is a scenario:  The father has a dominant blue eye gene + a recessive dark brown eye gene and two blond hair genes,  While the mother has a dominant blond hair gene + a recessive brown hair gene and has a dominant hazel eye gene and a recessive green eye gene.  Those two people have three kids: two have blond hair, one inherits his father's blue eye gene while the other inherits his mother's recessive green eye gene (leading to the first having blue eyes and the second having green eyes), and the last inherits his/her father's recessive dark brown gene and the mother's brown hair gene.    If you look at old photographs you might find some grandparents have the same dark brown eyes or brown hair as you.            Why does Justin Biebers hair blond but his eye brows brown?  justin does not have blonde hair its brown and it sometime just looks brown because of the light. btw his hair is amazing and so is his voice               Moobot  1,037,496 Contributions      What color eye and hair will a baby have if the mother has red hair and brown eyes and the father has blond hair and blue eyes?  I Would Say Red Hair With Brown Eyes,. Brown Eyes Dominate Over Blue Eyes And Red Over Blonde,   I Could Be Wrong, But Im Learning That In Science At The Moment So That's My Guess.               Dontstopbelieving  16 Contributions      What color eyes and hair will a baby have if the mother has dirty blond hair blue eyes and the father has light brown hair blue eyes?  It depends on the mother's and father's recessive genes. The baby may have blue eyes, but if the mother's mother's eyes are brown, the baby's eyes may be brown.            What color eyes and hair will a baby most likely have if the mother has black hair and brown eyes and the father has blond hair and blue eyes?  It is very likely that this baby will have black hair and brown eyes, yet there is a chance that it could have blonde hair and blue eyes but I doubt it.   Blond hair is uncommon compared to black hair. Blue eyes are also uncommon compared to brown eyes.            How common is blond hair and brown eyes?  I happen to have blonde hair and dark hazel eyes, and ive only met a couple other people who have similar characteristics but it is possible genetically, but rare. More than half of the natural blondes in the world are born with blue eyes.               AliceCullenInsanity  24 Contributions      Does Justin bieber like blonde hair and brown eyes?  Justin does not really care about hair i never heard him saying he does not like blonde's looks for a girl with nice smile and nice eyes and can make him laugh also said he would not mind if she was just funny .  . 
Let me say that he probably doesn't care. This is a matter of opinion and unless he tells us, we will never know. I just removed the first comment because it is EXTREMELY biased. I mean, don't you know that you have to have a reliable source for this stuff?            Both parents have brown eyes and hair have a blue eyed blond baby what is the chance of next baby having blond hair and blue eyes?  Well, it depends whether or not they have the recessive gene or not. If both parents have the recessive gene, then 1/4. If neither of them have that recessive gene, then it's not possible.            If a guy has blonde hair and blue eyes and a girl has blonde hair and brown eyes what would their baby look like?  Blonde hair and blue or brown eyes, there's no definite way of knowing before the baby is born.               Saskia Zaal  34 Contributions      If a man has brown hair and brown eyes and the woman has blonde hair and blue eyes can they have a blonde hair blue eye baby?  I believe so as long as the brown hair/brown eyed man carries the blonde/blue eye genes. both are recessive so they won't show up in the man, but if he has a parent or grandparent w/ blonde hair or blue eyes, it is somewhat likely. If the man has a sibling with brown hair or blue eyes it is more likely because it means both his parents have those recessive genes. Essentially, because the woman's genes in this case are recessive, the man's genes will determine the hair and eyes of the child.   Yes they can, but the man has to be heterozygous, so the dominant one and the recessive one,            What color eyes and hair will a baby have if mother has blonde hair hazel eyes father has dark brown hair brown eyes grandmother has blonde hair green eyes and grandfather has blonde hair hazel eyes?  Two alleles are responsible for determining both eye color and hair color. The allele for brown hair is dominant over the allele for blonde hair. The allele for brown eyes is dominant over the allele for blue eyes.    If the organism presents with the dominant allele it can either be homozygous or heterozygous. But if it presents with either blonde hair and/or blue eyes it is homozygous for the recessivge alleles.    Hazel, green and brown are all mutations of eye color but from the same allele that is responsible for brown eyes - so with the alleles there are really only to classes of eye color brown and blue - and if your not blue eyed your under brown eyes.    Letting; H = brown hair and h = blonde hair and E = brown eyes and e = blue eyes    Mother Blonde = hh Hazel = EE/Ee   Father Brown = HH/Hh Brown = EE/Ee    I assume the grandparents are from the mothers side because 2 natural blondes should only have blonde children naturally.    1/4 chance of baby being blonde 1/12 will have blue eyes     Another answer   It's very possible that a child could have red hair also with those genes. I have many family members that have a red headed child.               Heather Bear  47 Contributions      How do guys feel about blond curly hair and brown eyes?  I'm guessing pretty good. im no guy, but iv seen and i know some things they like. but it also depends what they think of you, not just your hair and eyes.            What is the best eyeshadow color for a girl with brown-blonde hair and brown eyes?  Lucky for you, brown eyes look best in the most eyeshadow colours. But specifically, what looks the best on brown eyes is gold, green, and purple. On an everyday basis, I would recommend the gold. The best gold to wear is an antique gold, meaning one that has a green tone to it. I have one and I get the most complements on my actual eyes, not just my eyeshadow, when I wear it. It's amazing on brown eyes. Hope this helps!               Madeleine Friesen  23 Contributions      Does blond hair look good with brown eyes?  Yes it does.

Sometimes it depends on more than one generation, i.e. grandparents. It's kind of unpredictable. Or hard to at least               Savanah Voyles  1 Contribution      Is it rare if you have blond hair and brown eyes?  No. It's actually more common to have brown eyes than blue or greeneyes. The connection between hair color and eye color isirrelevant; they are controlled by different genes.  If you are a child, being blond is not unusual. Often, the hairwill darken later, possibly to a light brown.  It is true, that brown eyes is more dominant over blue and green, Iwas born with platinum blonde hair, and even now my hair is still alight-ish blonde, and I have brown eyes. Blonde hair and browneyes, is actually the third rarest hair and eye color combination,in the world, next to red hair and green (blue) eyes, and blackhair and green eyes. So, it's not completely RARE, but it isn'tcommon.               Don Dfoofnik  4,378,239 Contributions  There are three kinds of answers: ones that are mostly right, ones that are mostly wrong, and those that once were right but now are wrong.      What color eyes and hair will a baby have if the father has brown hair and blue eyes the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes?  It is possible for the baby to have any hair color, because it may receive genes for the recessive trait (blonde hair, or even red hair) in preference to the dominant trait (brown hair). The likelihood is strong that the baby will have blue eyes, since both parents have the recessive gene.

Longhairgirl  54 Contributions      What color hair and eyes will a baby have if the mother has dark brown hair and brown eyes and the father has blond hair and blue eyes?

Usually, the pigments in your eyes, hair and skin are about the same. That's why you usually see people with naturally light hair (blonde, red) that have blue or green eyes and fair skin. Dark colored eyes are also dominant traits, so if a person has one parent with blue eyes and one with brown eyes, the child will most likely (about 75% chance) have brown eyes.

Mar 25, 2008     1,993 Posts               I am not a geneticist but have a degree in biochemistry so I took genetics as part of my required courses. The two things aren't really related, like multiple  members have mentioned above, hair color and eye color are alleles of different genes. I think it's cute that everybody is mentioning  their aunt/friend/daughter as examples but ,ultimately, it all comes down to the science.  Read the articles, the others have listed, if you want to know how this stuff works.             #32    May 15, 2008                  Sass   Fashion Honey  Thread Starter            Jun 23, 2007     1,280 Posts     Health          thanks everyone for your help and attached articles. Im sorry if have irritated anyone with my question, I was just wondering!  Yes i have seen children/ young teenagers who have blonde hair and brown eyes but i always understood that almost all would eventually grow up to have brown hair (even very light shades) and brown eyes.  My question was actually in reference to adults though. I have a basic understanding of the genetics its just that i've never actually seen it myself in real life on an adult.

According to the Forrest Gump law as applied to genetics: "You never know whutchew gonna git," brown-eyed blondes are far from the strangest things that are genetically possible .  It is possible to win the Power Ball, however that does not make it likely, and when we add that to the fact, as several have pointed out, that blonde hair, whether accompanied by brown eyes or not, tends to darken with age, and add to that the prevalence of changing/choosing one's hair color, and one more - add to that the perception of blonde as an especially desirable and attractive hair color, the likelihood, the probability, that either  Jessica Simpson, Shayne Lamas, or even the New Work Out skank Renessa are natural blondes today , is smaller than the likelihood that they A) were blondes as children B) really have blue eyes but are wearing brown contacts C) look as pretty as they would if they let it grow out.            #39    May 24, 2008                  chiara   piacere            Apr 11, 2006     472 Posts             missjenny2679 said: ↑   I think Britney Spears has Blonde hair and Brown eyes,but she might wear blue contacts....

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Blond Hair  Black People  Genetics and Heredity  Race and Ethnicity  Existence Question Are there natural blonde adult people with dark brown eyes? I saw a beautiful photo of a child with blonde hair and dark eyes from the Soloman Islands. Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers   Lucas Lundström Answered Apr 12, 2015 · Author has 536 answers and 853.1k answer views Yes. Domestic disputes as well as normal fights are common among natural blonde adult people as well. If you are referring to the iris of the eye, then yes and no. As we develops from childhood the melanocyte cells slowly begin to produce melanin darkening the irises and giving them the appearance of color. In dark skinned children the eyes are normally dark already from childhood. Irises are really always black or brown, depending on the concentration of melanin in the eye. The reason some eyes look blue or green etc. is not because they physically have that color, but because Rayleigh scattering makes it look like it. In either case, what I guess you are really asking is "Can adult blonde people have dark brown eyes?" and yes, adult blonde people can have dark brown eyes. It is uncommon, but can happen. The problem here is really to come to a consensus about what constitutes "black" eyes, and "blonde" hair. If I go into my local hair studio doing extensions here in Göteborg, Sweden, and pick up a packet of hair that we all strongly feel is clearly "brown" it will be labeled "blonde" because the manufacturer is American. American "blonde" is brown to us, brown to Americans is often dark brown or black to us, black to Americans seems mostly to be a racial term.., and Swedish true blonde seems to confuse Americans. If we go by American standards of what blonde hair looks like, then absolutely natural blondes can have naturally dark eyes. If we go to a little bit more reasonable level, then yes, it seems possible but uncommon. Sharp racial mixes may bring up this lovely mix of attributes, so look to people with for example one pale white British parent and one dark South American (dark Brazilian, dark Peruvian, etc.) parent. You can also check out the native Sami people of Northern Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Finland) that are sometimes quite blonde with really dark eyes. If you want to geek down and get into the nitty gritty check out MC1R which seems to be one of the key proteins that regulate the color of skin and hair, while eye color is controlled by other separate genetic markers. Some bring up the Brazilian model Victoria Brito as en example in discussions about blonde hair and dark eyes. It is difficult to assess her hair color from pictures, being a model and having her hair fixed over and over again, and trends these days include sometimes faking a lighter or darker outgrowth than the model naturally has. In some pictures she has just one hair color (most often light), and in others she has another darker or lighter outgrowth than the main hair color. 30.9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Myself : I'm from a French- Danish father (blonde, fair skin, bright blue eyes almost gray) and a Berber (Moroccan) mother (original population of North Africa, they are many ethnicities among the Berbers in my case my mother is descendant of a more Caucasian Berber group (Vandals ?), dark brown hair, brown eyes or pale gray eyes, olive skin and a Caucasian skull). I was born with black hair and a blonde strand of hair in the front of my head, and yellow/very light brown eyes as I grew up my hair fell progressively and got replaced by a full head of blonde and my eyes darkened. The nature of my hair is wavy. Funny how my eyes despite being dark they act up like light eyes and are very photosensitive. My skin is very fair (burns never tan) and I've got a straight nose.

[1] The common occurrence of blond hair among the dark-skinned indigenous people of the Solomon Islands is due to a homegrown genetic variant distinct from the gene that leads to blond hair in Europeans. In more detail [2] Blond hair is a rare human phenotype found almost exclusively in Europe and Oceania. Here, we identify a cystine-to-arginine change at a highly conserved residue in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) as the single source of blond hair in Solomon Islanders. This missense mutation is predicted to impact catalytic activity of the protein and causes blond hair through a recessive mode of inheritance. The novel mutation is at a frequency of 26% in the Solomon Islands but is absent outside of Oceania and represents the largest genetic effect on a visible human phenotype reported to date. Thus, getting intuition about the correlation between hair pigmentation and skin and eye pigmentation from experiences with Europeans isn’t related to the Soloman Island blonds.

What’s the difference between red and strawberry blonde hair?         Experts  What’s the difference between red and strawberry blonde hair?   Share                                 It’s often difficult to tell the difference between red and strawberry blonde hair . In fact, most people confuse the two and say that one is the other without really knowing why. What makes our hair go a deeper red rather than a strawberry blonde color? The pros reveal all.  Red hair, like any other hair color, has many different shades and tones. ‘Red hair can have shades ranging from light strawberry blonde to mahogany colors, but it’s often difficult to tell the difference between the two, unless there are coppery reflections when light hits the hair. Red and strawberry blonde are simply two different shades from the same color palette.’  Strawberry blonde is lighter than red hair. ‘It’s extremely rare for people to have hair that is naturally a strawberry blonde color. Basically, strawberry blonde is mostly based on red tones, with blonde highlights dotted here and there. It takes its name from the Italian renaissance. During this period, women lightened their hair using lemon juice and saffron in combination with the sun’s natural rays of light.’  Strawberry blonde therefore belongs to the red hair group. ‘Strawberry blonde is the lightest shade of red hair. Other tones in this color group include mahogany, copper and Irish red. When somebody says they have strawberry blonde hair, they’re stating their shade of red. Blondes might do the same by stating they have ice-blonde hair , for example.  Our tip: Red hair is often much thicker than blonde or brunette hair. To take control of your red hair, use a hair mask for thick hair . You can also try using the Jean Louis David Colour therapy range at home to revive the color of your hair and hydrate it.

Hair Color          Back to Hair Color           English   Español       Why is the combination of red hair and brown eyes so rare?        -A curious adult from Texas   May 18, 2007  No one knows for sure why this is. There isn't any evidence that the DNA changes that cause red hair also affect eye color. Or vice versa.  And the two aren't genetically linked like some other hair and eye colors. For example, blonde hair and blue eyes are known to be linked. Which is why blonde hair and brown eyes are so rare.  But we know this isn't the case for red hair and light colored eyes. How do we know this?  Because the DNA changes in the MC1R gene that cause red hair are on chromosome 16. And the DNA changes in the OCA2 gene that cause blue eyes are found on chromosome 15.  Genetically linked traits need to be on the same chromosome. Like blonde hair and blue eyes which are both found on chromosome 15. This is important because of how genes are passed on to our children.  We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain almost all of our genes. We pass our genes down to our children in these chromosome chunks.  So if the DNA changes for blue eyes and blonde hair happen to both be on the same copy of chromosome 15, then they will tend to travel together*. Think about it like suitcases at the airport.  Imagine you have blonde hair coloring and blue contact lenses that you are taking with you on a trip. If you have two separate suitcases, then there is a chance that one might get sent to Detroit and the other to Honolulu. Your blonde hair coloring will be in one place and your contact lenses in another.  But if you only have one suitcase, everything in it will almost always travel together. Wherever your suitcase ends up, the blonde hair dye and the blue contact lenses will arrive at the same place.  Same thing with genes on the same chromosome. The DNA changes that cause blonde hair and blue eyes are usually on the same chromosome (in the same suitcase). So they usually arrive together.  But this explanation doesn't work for red hair and light eye color because the DNA changes that cause them are on different chromosomes. They are in different suitcases.  Most likely red hair and light colored eyes tend to be together because of luck. And the possible survival advantages of each and the light skin that comes with them.  Let's think back to a time before there was red hair. Imagine for some reason, the folks in Northern Europe have lighter colored eyes. This may be because their ancestors found lighter eyes more attractive ( sexual selection ). Or perhaps there is some other advantage ( click here for some possibilities).  So we have a population in Northern Europe with light colored eyes. And everywhere else there are brown eyes.  Now imagine that a DNA change happens in Africa and in Europe that causes red hair. This wouldn't be surprising -- our DNA changes all the time .  Most of the time these DNA changes don't matter. But sometimes they can cause a disease. And sometimes a DNA change can change how someone looks.  Now we have a redhead in Africa and one in Northern Europe. The redhead in Europe is very successful and does better than the folks around him. So the red hair spreads.  But the redhead in Africa has all sorts of problems. Eventually the red hair gene dies out because s/he can't compete as well as everyone else.  The end result of this is redheads with light colored eyes. Not because the genes are necessarily linked. But because the red hair happened to occur in a population with light colored eyes.  Of course we don't have any evidence for this story. But it is a plausible one because of a side effect of red hair -- light skin.  We need a certain amount of sunlight to make vitamin D. If you don't get enough vitamin D you end up with rickets , an awful disease.  The darker your skin is, the more sunlight you need. Northern Europe gets so little sunlight that lighter skinned people have a real advantage. People like redheads.  In Africa, people with light skin are at a real disadvantage. The extra sunlight exposure can cause birth defects by destroying their folic acid. And they will end up riddled with skin cancer later in life since no one has invented sunscreen yet.  So in which population do you think red hair will prosper and spread? Yup, amongst those Northern Europeans with light colored eyes.  Because of this, you just happen to end up with lots of redheads with light colored eyes. This is one idea anyway.  As more mixing between populations happens, we would predict that red hair and light colored eyes will both become less common. But another prediction, if the little story I've spun is true, is that a larger percentage of the redheads that are left may have brown eyes. We'll have to wait and see.  * This is a simplified version. Because of something called recombination, it is important that the DNA changes be on the same chromosome and close to each other.

Our species was originally dark (full melanocyte activity) but some people became lighter when they moved away from dark equatorial forest, lived in lighter surroundings and their melanocyte cells reacted by a reduction in activity. This gave lighter shades, with reflected outside light, seen as blue, mixing to give hazel, grey or green and near-complete absence of melanin giving 'blue' eyes. We usually follow our nearest relatives in the amount of melanin we have, so if our parents have little melanin (blond hair which is actually very light brown) and blue eyes, we will probably be the same. If one parent has a bit more melanin this will increase our melanin. But nothing in nature is 100% so two blue/eyed, fair-haired parents could just possibly have children whose melanocytes made a little more melanin. 935 Views promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question   Kristina Winifred Osborne , studied at Sir Sandford Fleming College Frost Campus Answered Mar 1, 2015 There is undoubtably a complexity to eye colour and hair colour. Lets start with eyes it is most likely that if two blue eyed parents had a child that the child would have blue eyes about 93% approximately give or take, but there is a 5% chance of hazels eyes being carried as a recessive gene (not all forms of hazel eyes need a dominant brown gene to express this. since hazel is kinda like the wild card when it comes to eye colour) and the the last 2% is green eyes since this is a colour that only really appears from blue eyed parents or carriers of blue eyes. Since green is technically blue eyes with another colour gene that adds melanin (natural brown pigment) to the back layer of the iris which causes the green like effect. (Brown eyes have this colour on the front layer of their iris) and now to the hair, for the most part hair is a bit of a guessing game cause it dosnt really consist of dominate and resessive genes, the DNA that effects your hair tends to be a mix of the parents hair colour on average. Or sometimes a child will display only one parents hair colour. Or you get families like mine that throw all these rules out the window with my grandparents both having light grey blue eyes and one of my uncles having brown eyes, my mother has hazel and the rest of my mothers brothers are blue eyed without expressing the grey hue. And my hair and my sisters is naturaly light brown when both are parents having dark brown almost black hair. So it depends on far more genes then could ever be explained on here and it depends on how many carrier genes the parents have that they probably dont even know about. Like red headed genes... Or hormonal changes as a child ages i was born a dark red head, which changed to blond as a child to darken to the mousy brown i have naturally. And i have another friend who was born with black hair and his all fell out at a young age to become platinum blond. Genes they are a crazy lottery! 3.8k Views Thank you for your feedback!

Multiple genes and multiple variants of these genes interact to determine eye color." (see https://www.23andme.com/health/E... ) Hair color is a similarly complex trait, with at least two genes thought to be involved. ( https://www.23andme.com/health/H... ) Because the genetics of either are not entirely understood, the true probability is hard to calculate, but significantly less than 25% is a good guess. As you can see from the Eye Color article above, the data for just one particular gene associated with eye color shows that a person with a genotype correlated with blue/gray eyes (72%) can still have a 27% chance of having green/hazel eyes and 1% chance of black/brown eyes. Assuming for example's sake that the hair color gene(s) work similarly and that the traits are independent, the probability would be 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784 (<8%). 10.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers   Lucas Lundström Answered Apr 12, 2015 · Author has 536 answers and 853.1k answer views Yes. Domestic disputes as well as normal fights are common among natural blonde adult people as well. If you are referring to the iris of the eye, then yes and no. As we develops from childhood the melanocyte cells slowly begin to produce melanin darkening the irises and giving them the appearance of color. In dark skinned children the eyes are normally dark already from childhood. Irises are really always black or brown, depending on the concentration of melanin in the eye. The reason some eyes look blue or green etc. is not because they physically have that color, but because Rayleigh scattering makes it look like it. In either case, what I guess you are really asking is "Can adult blonde people have dark brown eyes?" and yes, adult blonde people can have dark brown eyes. It is uncommon, but can happen. The problem here is really to come to a consensus about what constitutes "black" eyes, and "blonde" hair. If I go into my local hair studio doing extensions here in Göteborg, Sweden, and pick up a packet of hair that we all strongly feel is clearly "brown" it will be labeled "blonde" because the manufacturer is American. American "blonde" is brown to us, brown to Americans is often dark brown or black to us, black to Americans seems mostly to be a racial term.., and Swedish true blonde seems to confuse Americans. If we go by American standards of what blonde hair looks like, then absolutely natural blondes can have naturally dark eyes. If we go to a little bit more reasonable level, then yes, it seems possible but uncommon. Sharp racial mixes may bring up this lovely mix of attributes, so look to people with for example one pale white British parent and one dark South American (dark Brazilian, dark Peruvian, etc.) parent. You can also check out the native Sami people of Northern Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Finland) that are sometimes quite blonde with really dark eyes. If you want to geek down and get into the nitty gritty check out MC1R which seems to be one of the key proteins that regulate the color of skin and hair, while eye color is controlled by other separate genetic markers. Some bring up the Brazilian model Victoria Brito as en example in discussions about blonde hair and dark eyes. It is difficult to assess her hair color from pictures, being a model and having her hair fixed over and over again, and trends these days include sometimes faking a lighter or darker outgrowth than the model naturally has. In some pictures she has just one hair color (most often light), and in others she has another darker or lighter outgrowth than the main hair color. 30.9k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

[1] The common occurrence of blond hair among the dark-skinned indigenous people of the Solomon Islands is due to a homegrown genetic variant distinct from the gene that leads to blond hair in Europeans. In more detail [2] Blond hair is a rare human phenotype found almost exclusively in Europe and Oceania. Here, we identify a cystine-to-arginine change at a highly conserved residue in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) as the single source of blond hair in Solomon Islanders. This missense mutation is predicted to impact catalytic activity of the protein and causes blond hair through a recessive mode of inheritance. The novel mutation is at a frequency of 26% in the Solomon Islands but is absent outside of Oceania and represents the largest genetic effect on a visible human phenotype reported to date. Thus, getting intuition about the correlation between hair pigmentation and skin and eye pigmentation from experiences with Europeans isn’t related to the Soloman Island blonds.

Almost anything is possible, but only a few things are probable— you feel me? So first you need to get that some genes are stronger than others—we call these dominant genes. And generally, genes for dark colours in skin, hair, eyes etc. are dominant over light colours. If we have a dominant gene from one parent and a recessive (weaker) gene from another parent, chances are that the child is going to get the dominant gene. So for example, if the gene for black hair is BB and the gene for blonde is bb , the child could have only one possible hair colour: black. This is shown in the diagram below, (assuming you have 4 kids or less): You see, as long as your dominant black ( BB ) gene is around, her recessive ( bb ) gene will tag along, but your children will appear to have black hair. However, they will be carriers- they will “carry” her blonde genes, and if they have partners with genes that are recessive to blonde hair, their children could be blonde! This is, of course, assuming that you and your girlfriend are both purebred; that is, nowhere in your genes do you have a gene for anything but black hair, and neither does she have a gene for anything but blonde hair. It’s actually quite possible that both of you are “carriers” for other genes. Lets assume that you are a carrier for blonde hair—so your genotype would be Bb —and she is a carrier for red hair, genotype br . Watch the possibilities: In this case, there is a 50% chance of your kids having black hair, and a 50% chance of them having blonde hair—but NO chance of any of them being purebred for black hair since neither of you are. The two red squares indicate the children with black hair; one of them carries a recessive gene for red hair, Br , while the other carries a recessive gene for blonde hair, Bb . The other two squares are the blonde children. One of them is purebred for blonde hair, bb , while the other is a carrier for red hair, br . So long story short: there is no way to ascertain what hair colours they will have without knowing the exact genotypes of you and your girlfriend. However, considering the family history you mentioned, one or more of your kids will probably have black hair, but other colours are possible. 13.3k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Care.com Find childcare near you.

Olin College of Engineering (2011) Answered Jan 16, 2017 · Upvoted by  Nicholas Anthony , MSc Human Genetics, McGill University · Author has 65 answers and 157.8k answer views A lot of the answers here are wrong. They mention things like recessive genes, 25% probabilities, and draw Punnett squares ( Punnett square - Wikipedia ) This would be pretty reasonable, if hair color was determined by a single gene, if blonde genes were always recessive, as is commonly thought, and if the same hair color was always caused by the same genes. But none of this is true. To be fair, there is one gene (consisting of series of base pairs, with many different possible configurations), MC1R, that has a major role in determining the overall “coloring” (melanin production) an individual’s skin, hair, and eyes. The particular copies of this gene that you inherit from your parents can play a large role in your own coloring, but because this gene has so many different configurations from person to person (not simply an “on/off” “1/0” type of thing), it’s difficult to predict how the combination of genes from two different parents might interact. One person’s red hair may very easily be caused by a completely different version of MC1R than another person’s red hair, and may be passed on very differently. MC1R is also supplemented by a wide variety of other genes, some of which are unknown. For example, some peoples in Oceania commonly have blonde hair, caused by a gene mutation that has nothing to do with MC1R, and that evolved independently from European populations with similarly blonde hair. In short, it’s almost impossible to tell! However, I will say that, without knowing anything about your DNA other than hair color, yes, there’s a good chance that your hypothetical children will have a hair color other than black.

I guess the best description would be what L’Oreal calls “Medium Blonde Hair: rich, multi-dimensional blonde with shades that range from golden to sun-kissed to strawberry.” I have very dark hair (essentially black) and blue eyes. Our kids: Same medium blond hair as my wife, with lots of red undertones; somewhat frizzy and prone to forming dreadlocks. Jet black hair and totally straight. Extremely blonde, nearly white hair, which as my son has grown older has darkened up, but does not have the red undertones. When he was little the hair was so fine and wispy that it would just float around his head like a halo. We didn’t have a fourth child, but perhaps number 4 would have had red hair.

Undo   Essence Park , studied Human Biology & Literature at Palomar College Answered Oct 28, 2017 The simplest answer is dark brown/black or medium brown. The scientific answer begins with genetics. The genes responsible for hair color originally produced a lot of pigment(dark colors) while blonde/light hair is actually a mutation somewhere along one of the genes that caused it to malfunction and not produce as much pigment as it normally would. This is one reason why blonde hair is recessive, because essentially, the gene is not correct(but still is expressed, null mutation). Parent Bk: Black Haired Parent Bd: Blonde Haired Dark haired genes are dominant, meaning if your child gets one piece of a gene(s) from parent Bk that is(are) dominant, they will likely have or develop dark hair as the recessive gene(s) are overpowered. This is why some children are born with blonde or light hair that developes into dark brown/black as they age. Theoretically, Parent Bk would have to have a part of a blonde recessive gene(there are multiple genes but even one is enough) to give to a child in order for them to have blonde hair. Or, the gene(s) they receive from parent Bk malfunctions and the recessive gene(s) from parent Bd is(are) the only one(s) expressed making the kid blonde. The law of Segregation is a study proposed by Gregor Mendel while studying pea plants. He proposed that any one trait(phenotype) can be singled out and studied to produced offspring with planned traits. This is how we come about the Punnett Square, developed by Reginald Punnett, which is non disputed as the best method for determining gene expression in any one offspring. It begins with a 3:1 ratio, 3 offspring will have dominant expression while a fourth will be recessive. Testing this out on peat plants(something that can easily be replicated) found that the larger the sample size, the more the results averaged out to this 3:1 ratio. A small sample size such as children of two specific parents, may not express this 3:1 ratio but if the parent’s gametes are studied, you will find that it eventually devolves into this ratio. Because we don’t know for sure what alleles parent Bk has, you could end up with children who all have dark hair(not explicitly black but dark) or 50/50 dark/light If parent Bk has alleles that all function well, they will only pass on those alleles and since parent Bd only has poorly functioning alleles, they can only pass on those alleles. Almost always well functioning alleles will overpower the poorly functioning alleles but if parent Bk has a set of poorly functioning alleles then the odds of having a child with light hair increase dramatically. Parent Bk can pass on either well functioning or poorly functioning alleles and parent Bd can only pass on poorly functioning alleles. If child A gets poor alleles from both mom and dad, then they will almost certainly have light hair. If child B gets both good and poor alleles, they may start with light hair that develops into dark hair, or will only have dark hair. Because dark alleles are dominant and one parent has them, it is more likely you will have dark haired children, you may still have light haired children, but more will be dark. 480 Views   Ashley Grassano Answered Oct 5, 2017 You can read all the science about it, but here are my real-life examples: My grandmother was a natural blonde, my grandfather had jet black hair: My mother was blonde as a child, and it turned into what she called a “mousy brown” in her teens. My uncle always had jet black hair. My sister-in-law is a blonde and her husband has jet black hair: First born is blonde haired, blue eyed, fair skinned. He looks very much like my husband at that age, who was blonde as a child and now has dark brown hair. Husband and SIL’s folks were blonde/black hair combo as well. Second born has medium brown hair, light brown eyes, and is olive skinned. Neither parent is olive skinned, so that one came out of nowhere. Both kids have the same hair texture, thin and straight. I suspect #2’s hair will become black as he ages. So, in terms of “likely”, based on my very small pool of data, it seems like the chances are 50/50. :) 597 Views · View Upvoters   Caitlin Luera , Sys Admin (2017-present) Answered Sep 19, 2017 Everyone else can tell you about genetics. I’ll just tell you what happened in my case. My father had jet black hair and my mother had blonde hair. First child was born with brown hair and dark brown eyebrows. Gradually, and during the teenage years, the brown hair gradually became darker until it was an extremely dark brown color that was indistinguishable from black 90% of the time. The eyebrows turned jet black during the same time. Second child was born with blonde hair and light brown eyebrows. Gradually, and during the teenage years, the blonde hair grew darker until it was a medium brown. The eyebrows grew to be a darker brown than the hair. Facial hair (male) was dark brown. Genetics can be fun. My parents had other children but with other partners so I can’t use them for direct comparison to answer this example. 394.6k Views · View Upvoters   Kelli McMillan , Just because I'm a teen doesn't mean I don't know anything Answered Oct 13, 2017 My mother is Thai and has jet black hair and dark brown eyes while my father is extremely white, having blonde hair and blue eyes. I am their only child, although my father had two other kids. But anyway, I was born with blue eyes and medium dark hair. As I grew older my eyes turned to be brown slightly around the irises, green for the most part of my eye plus a tinge of blue on the outer ring. My hair actually grew lighter so it's more of a medium light brown. I'm the summer it gets really light and turns to almost blonde. The funny thing is, my dad’s two other kids both have really dark brown hair and brown eyes both both of their parents are blonde with blue eyes. People can say all they want about how Asian kids will always have black hair and almost black eyes, it's not really true.

Typically, dark hair and eyes are dominant over light hair and eyes. However, if there are blondes on both sides of the family, that increases the chances of a child turning up blonde. My husband had white-blonde hair as a small child, which gradually darkened to medium brown as a teenager. I had medium brown as a small child, which became very dark brown by my teenage years. We have 3 children. One born blonde but is now medium brown, one dark brown, and one with pale red hair.

My younger sister inherited all these traits. My mother is of Northern European descent- fair-skinned with blonde hair and green eyes. I am fair-skinned with green eyes, but a redhead. No one on either side of my family, going back as many generations as anyone can remember, is a redhead. Yes, it is a recessive gene, but in this case, it’s recessive enough for me to feel like I might be the milkman’s daughter. At one holiday dinner, an aunt finally said, “Didn’t Uncle Ralph have red hair???” Having NEVER heard of an Uncle Ralph before, I asked who the hell Uncle Ralph was. Several family members started to say, “He did have red hair, didn’t he?” And then one family member informed me that Uncle Ralph (I suppose he would be my great uncle) had supposedly disappeared when they were all quite young, apparently having been kidnapped by The Mafia. Okay. Yeah. So naturally, I do not believe there was ever an “Uncle Ralph”, and I accused my family of all coming up with this story together to convince me that I am in fact related to all of them despite being the only ginger in the known family history. It is still an ongoing joke, and my family finds it hilarious that I continue to tell them that they did such a poor job with the fake Uncle Ralph story, that it only served to convince me that I am definitely secretly adopted. They still maintain that they are telling the truth about having a redheaded Uncle Ralph who disappeared leaving no proof of his existence, which is weird enough to make some part of me seriously still think I might just be adopted. But really, the point is, I’m probably not, hair genes are just crazy and complicated, and maybe there really was an Uncle Ralph who was the only other awkward ginger in my family. BUT nothing anyone says can convince me that he was kidnapped by The Mafia. Edit: Just to throw a little actual science in there to clarify for some people commenting, recessive genes must be inherited from both parents in order to be expressed. So, if a person has red hair, that means that both of their parents are carriers of the red hair gene. Doesn’t matter what color hair the parents have. That is a bit of a part of the joke. Both sides of my family have to have red hair down the line somewhere, yet out of all those people there just is no evidence of that until I was born. So it was a surprise. Hence the joke of me being adopted. Scientifically, though, it is totally understandable that it just hadn’t happened for many generations until me. Or maybe Uncle Ralph. ;) Also, my dad’s side of the family (the Portuguese) were especially surprised, maybe even a little upset, to find that some of them are apparently carriers of the “ginger gene”. Which I find hilarious. They need to brush up on the history of the people of Portugal. 11.9k Views · View Upvoters   Esther S , Mom to two since 2008; Auntie to many. Answered Oct 2, 2017 Hard to tell in general, but next to impossible without even knowing race. As some others have said, it varies depending on multiple genes that are all inherited differently. The single best way for a lay person to guess is to look at the homogeneity in each of the parents’ respective families. The more alike they all are, the more likely they are to have strong representation for that color in their genes. Then remember that most blonde genes are recessive, meaning that if a kid inherits blonde genes it will likely be overridden or modified (made darker) by any genes for other colors. Guesses for this situation based on race: If both are of W. European descent (British/German/French) they are most likely to have anything but black hair. Throw some Spanish, S. Italian, or Middl Eastern in there and the chances for black hair go up significantly. Northern European increases the chances of blonde or lighter brown hair. If the black hair is from an Asian parent, the same black hair is much more likely than anything else as Asian features tend to be pretty dominant over others. If the black hair is due to African descent… let’s just not go there, Africa has too much variation by region, and African-Americans are almost all of mixed white/black ancestry. In my own family (W. European), grandparents had black hair. Their 9 children had black(3), brown (1), blonde(2), and red(3). 1.1k Views · View Upvoters Quora User , Very genetically diverse Answered Oct 8, 2017 · Author has 5.8k answers and 38m answer views Well hey… those are my folks’ exact hair colors.

Then X marries Y, a nice blonde from a line of honey blondes, dirty blondes, golden, white and strawberry blondes, with the occasional redhead. The child of X and Y (Z) has a fair (haha) chance of being some form of blonde themselves. in fact, with this history they could have all blond children. However, if X is from a purely jet black hair line, and Y has some brunette mixed in (likely) then chances are that Z will be a light to dark brown. Z being blonde or jet black is not likely.

I always wanted blonde hair instead of my brown hair. My little sister was the same as well. No one in my dad's family had blonde hair so none of my parents children would have blonde. My sister was a little bit darker though. All in all, the children are likely to have all three different hair colors depending on the genetics of the parents. Blonde hair is recessive so the jet black haired parent may carry the gene, resulting in a blonde child.

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 6 Answers   Adam Smith , studied at Royton and Crompton School Answered Sep 14, 2016 It depends if you have blue eyes in your family, whether any of your grandparents or parents have blue eyes. If so there is a bigger chance than if there aren’t any blue eyed people in your family, but even if there aren’t any blue eyed people in your family, there is a chance that your children could have blue eyes. This is because unlike previously thought blue eyes are NOT recessive and there are atleast 15 genes that contribute to eye colour, not two. This explains how blue eyed parents can have brown eyed children (which happens much more frequently than you may think). So with all of this in account it would be fairly hard to predict if you’r children will have blue eyes, even with your whole families eye colour and genetic records. Presuming both your parents and you have brown eyes I'd say there's a higher chance your child/children will have brown eyes. But in the end genetic inheritance is basically like a wheel of chance, you spin the wheel and whatever it lands on you get. 3.2k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below Can two brown-eyed people have a blue-eyed child?

Ask New Question   Mark Ross , studied at Fresno City College Answered Mar 30, 2018 · Author has 76 answers and 9k answer views Well, from a very primitive Medellian view, brown is dominant and blue is recessive. Two brown eyed parents can have children with any eye color (because their dominant brown possibly may be paired with a recessive blue). Two blue eyed parents can’t have a brown eyed child because to have blue eyes you must have two recessive genes. It’s my understanding however, that this is an over-simplified view of the genetic dance. There is more than one genetic component to eye color. So, although the information above holds true in most cases, there are times when two blue eyed parents CAN have a brown eyed child. Your kid, in short, could end up with virtually any color eyes. 288 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by 23andMe Explore your DNA with 23andMe.

Did either of your parents have blue eyes? You could have all brown eyed children or half of them could be blue eyed and the other half brown eyed. Blue eyes are a recessive trait which means that in order to have blue eyes you would need two copies of the blue eyed gene. So your wife having blue eyes has two copies of the blue gene and will pass it down to you children. Brown eyes are dominant which means that if you have one brown gene and one blue gene your eyes will still be brown. Therefore you might have two brown genes or one brown and one blue. If you have two brown genes then your children will all have one brown gene from you and one blue from your wife. In that case your children will all have brown eyes but your grandchildren could have blue eyes if your children married a blued eyed partner.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Blond Hair  Hair Color  Genetics and Heredity  Hair Is it possible that a blond child is born to non-blond (brunette or dark-haired) parents? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 8 Answers Anonymous Answered Jul 8, 2016 Yes it is. You have to remember that brown hair is dominant and blond hair is recessive. So we will now name brown hair ‘B’ and blonde hair ‘b’. If you mix these together, you of course will get a child with brown hair, because it is dominant. So this is B mixed with b. On the left you see 2 small ‘b’s. That is the mother (for example). On the top you see 2 capital letters ‘B’. That is for example the father. The 4 squares you see on the inside are the children. They have brown eyes. If one of these children will find a wife that also has the mother blue eyes, and the father brown eyes, it is possible to get a child with blue eyes. This is the new punnet square. On the left you see the mother aigain (the wife that child Bb just met) and on top you see child Bb. They get children together. People have 2 sex linked chromosomes, which are with child Bb now B & b. One of these you will pass on to your children. That is the same with your wife. If you both pass on your small letter b, you will get a child with blue eyes! if one of you passes on the small letter, and the other passes in the big letter your child will get brown eyes. But, it will be a carrier of the gene with blue eyes. So that child cán get a child with blue eyes! If you both pass on your capital letter B, your child will get brown eyes and it won’t ever get a child with blue eyes. So: if one of both of your parents have blue eyes, then: 25 % change on a child with blue eyes 50 % change on a child with brown eyes, but it will be a carrier of blue eyes. 25 % change on brown eyes and it won’t get a child with blue eyes. if only one of you guys have a parent or grandparent with blue eyes, you won’t be getting a child with blue eyes.

Back in the (seriously) olden days, women used to try to bleach their locks with everything from horse urine to pigeon dung. (We don't recommend you try that at home.)  Whether you come by your blonde hair "legally" or make that faithful appointment with your stylist every 6-8 weeks, here's what you need to know about this preternaturally playful hair color.   1. Being naturally blonde is pretty rare. Only 2 percent of people in the world are natural blondes . (About 1 in 20 Americans.) But that doesn't mean it's not popular. One in three women dye their locks light enough to be blonde.  2. Blonde hair comes from a teeny-tiny genetic mutation. How tiny? Think one letter change among 3 billion letters that make up your DNA .  3. Blondes aren't blondes forever. (Naturally, at least.) Many kids born with light hair go dark before their tenth birthday, thanks to rising levels of eumelanin, a natural pigment that regulates the darkness of hair strands.  4. Having blonde hair doesn't necessarily mean you have blue eyes.  It's a stereotype . Although red hair and light eyes and light skin DO tend to go together, blondies can have eyes that are blue, green, brown, etc.  5. There are 50 shades of gray ... and 30 shades of blonde. Yep, there are really that many hues that can be considered blonde . Seriously. For instance, Taylor Swift has café au lait locks; Gwen Stefani's are golden platinum; and Cara Delevingne rocks a gray blonde. (Beyonce's a "brownde" -- a brownish-blonde -- just FYI.)  More from The Stir:  Going Platinum Blonde Is Easy With These 4 Expert Tips (PHOTO)  6. Blond-haired, blue-eyed men are blondes' biggest fans. The reason has roots in evolutionary psychology. Both blonde hair and blue eyes are recessive traits, so BOTH parents must have them to pass on to their kids. Scientists think men with light hair and eyes are instinctively drawn to women with the same coloring. That way, he'll know for sure he's the dad of any offspring.  7. Blondes not only have more fun -- they have MORE hair. Most people have about 120,000 hairs on their head, but people with light-colored locks have even more. The reason? Blonde hair is finer than other colors, so the scalp can "hold" more.  8. Gentlemen (probably do) prefer blondes. Several published studies have found that men find blondes more attractive than women with other hair colors. Blonde women are most likely to be picked up in a bar. Heck, they're also more likely to be helped by a man when they drop something on a sidewalk.  More from The Stir : 10 Intriguing Scientific Facts About Redheads  9. But there's a dark side to men's attraction, too. Research published in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology found that men think blondes are usually needy, high-maintenance, and neurotic . (So, stop trying to pick us up in bars already then!)  10. Forget "dumb blonde" -- blondes make men act dumb. ...Although not for the reasons you might think. When French men were shown pics of blonde women, then given a general knowledge test, they did worse on it than when they looked at images of dark-haired women. The reason? Researchers say the stereotype of "dumb blonde" is so ingrained that men were simply behaving in kind. Oookay , OR they're just dumbfounded by our beauty!  11. But blondes get the last laugh! Researchers at the University of Queensland found that not only are blonde women paid more than their peers with other hair colors, but they're also more likely to marry a wealthier man .

Dominant vs. Recessive          Back to Dominant vs. Recessive           English   Español       Both parents have brown eyes and brown hair. They have twins and one has brown hair and blue eyes while the other have blonde hair and blue eyes. Which features are dominant and how do you know?        -An undergraduate from the UK   August 29, 2013  This is a great question! From a first pass we would conclude that blue eyes and blonde hair are recessive.  Unfortunately we’d be wrong about the blonde hair (and only partly right about eye color).  The way you figure out if a trait is dominant or recessive is you look for patterns.  As I’ll explain in more detail later, if a trait is recessive, then it can appear even if both parents don’t have that trait.  Another way to tell if a trait is recessive is if both parents and all their kids share that same trait.  In our case here, both parents have brown eyes but they had a blue-eyed child.  So this follows the first pattern meaning blue eyes are recessive.  The same would be true for blonde hair.  Both parents had brown hair but they had a child with blonde hair.  As I said, though, we’d be wrong.  It turns out that eye color and most hair colors are way too complicated to be simple dominant/recessive traits.  Surprisingly, blue-eyed parents sometimes have a brown-eyed child .  Now this isn’t that common so we could still say that blue eyes are mostly recessive.  The same isn’t really true for blonde hair.  Blonde parents often have darker haired children (or even redheads).  This is why you can’t just look at a single family to figure this stuff out.  You need to look at lots and lots of families and lots and lots of kids.  Only then do you have a chance at figuring out if a trait is dominant or recessive.  For example, imagine that in our case both kids had brown eyes.  We might conclude that brown eyes are recessive because all the parents and kids had the same eye color.   But this is not at all correct.  If you only look at one example you can miss the right answer!  In fact this is where the wrong ideas about attached ear lobes, rolling your tongue and lots of other supposedly simple dominant and recessive traits came from.  Scientists jumped to the wrong conclusion from studying too few families.  One of the big reasons why blonde hair and blue eyes (and all those other traits) fail as true recessives is that they are not due to a single gene.  And truly recessive traits almost always involve a single gene.  Of course just because a single gene is involved doesn’t mean you’ll for sure have a clear dominant or recessive pattern. The ABO blood type is a great example of this.  For the rest of the answer I want to focus on why dominant and recessive traits follow the patterns I’ve described.  And why being due to more than one gene can disrupt the whole thing.   Why Patterns Work  As I mentioned it would be pretty easy to answer this question if blonde hair and blue eyes were due to a single gene.  Let’s see why.  For this, we’ll focus on a dominant trait that really is due to a single gene—the ability to taste Phenylthiocarbamide or PTC .  PTC is a bitter tasting chemical similar to one found in broccoli and brussel sprouts that three out of every four people can taste.  With this trait, two parents who can’t taste PTC rarely have a child that can taste it.  And sometimes parents who can taste PTC have a child that can’t taste it.  This fits our patterns meaning that the ability to taste PTC is a dominant trait (and not being able to taste is a recessive one).  Let’s dig a bit deeper to see why.  There are two versions of the gene that determines if you can taste PTC—T and t.  The T version lets you taste PTC and the t version does not.  Another name for these two different versions of the same gene are alleles.  Whether or not a person can taste PTC depends on which alleles of the gene they have.  If this is all there was then it would be very hard to see why tasters even had nontasters.  To understand that, we need to know that people have two copies of each gene. They get one copy from their mom and one from their dad.  If a person gets two copies of the T allele (so their genotype is TT), then it is clear that they will be able to taste PTC.  The same idea holds true if they get two copies of the t allele.  In this case they will be tt and so not be able to taste PTC.  However, if a person gets one copy of the T allele, and one of the t allele, it turns out they can still taste PTC.  This means that tasting PTC (the T allele) is dominant because if you get a single copy from either parent you show that version of the trait. In other words, these carriers can taste PTC.  The opposite is true for not being able to taste PTC (the t allele). It is recessive, as it will be hidden whenever a person has a T copy of the gene.  So the only combination that will cause a person to NOT be able to taste PTC is when they have two copies of the t allele (tt).  Now we are almost ready to explain why nontaster parents rarely have a taster child and why taster parents sometimes have a child that can’t taste PTC.  The last piece of the puzzle we need is that each parent passes just one of their alleles to his or her child.  And that allele is chosen at random.  Now we are ready to see where the patterns come from.  We’ll do this by looking at three different scenarios.  First, let’s imagine two nontaster parents.  Here is what this might look like genetically:    First off, you can see that both parents are tt.  This is the definition of a nontaster.  Remember each child will get one allele from mom and one from dad.  Since the parents can only pass a t, all the kids are guaranteed to be tt.  None of them will be able to taste PTC.  This is why parents with a recessive trait have children with recessive traits too*.  Now let’s look at two tasters who happen to be TT:    Again, they only have one allele they can pass down…in this case a T.    This means all their kids will be TT and so will be able to taste PTC.  Finally, let’s look at two tasters that carry a hidden nontaster allele.  As you can see, both parents are Tt:    In this case, if both mom and dad happen to pass their t to their child, then the child will be tt.  That child will not be able to taste PTC.  But of course these parents don’t have to have a child that can’t taste PTC.  In fact, each child only has a 25% chance of ending up a nontaster.  This is why we have to look at lots and lots of families to figure out if a trait is recessive or dominant.  In one family, taster parents may have all taster kids even if the parents were carriers.  This would make being a taster look like a recessive trait even though it isn’t.  Again we see the importance of looking at lots and lots of families.   *Even this isn’t 100% for PTC.  Occasionally parents who can’t taste PTC have a child that can.  There are a number of ways this can happen but most of the time, these parents would have a child who can’t taste PTC.   Different Patterns  We won’t have time to go into it here, but if there are multiple genes involved, these patterns can break down pretty quickly.  Click here for an example of this with eye color and here for one with blood type.  When we look at lots of families for eye color, we see a pattern that sort of looks like blue eyes are recessive and brown are dominant.  But we also see the more than occasional blue eyed parents having a brown eyed child.  And we aren’t even throwing in green and hazel and everything else!  Hair color is an even bigger mess.  If we look at enough families, we tend to see lots of blending.  A dark haired parent and a light haired parent will often have a child with a color in between.  Black + Blonde = Brown!  So all in all the answer to your question is neither!  Blonde hair, brown hair, blue eye, browns eyes …none of those traits are dominant or recessive as they are not due to a single gene.  Which in a lot of ways is a good thing because multi-gene traits allow for all of the wonderful variation we see around us!

By the time I was in high school, it was "paper bag brown" .  It was also really oily and always looked dirty.  I started "frosting it" to improve the color and also to dry it out some.  I was ever so glad when foiling was invented.  It was torture to have long hair pulled through a cap with crochet hooks.    Cut to the chase - I was born blonde with hazel eyes.      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Sorcerer    34            Sorcerer    34    Molecule       Senior Members    34   1104 posts   Location:  New Zealand              Posted January 16, 2005        Hey guys happy you discussing this, I have notice than from all my friends that recently had kids, where one of the parents have brown eyes and the other blue eyes, the kids all have BLUE EYES, as you know Bb (B=Brown, b=blue) Brown is a dominant gene and in general most of them should have brown eyes. Has anyone else notice this?    This means the parents are bb and Bb and that means the grandparents are xb xb and Bx xb where x is unknown, so the parents of the brown eye parent were blue and brown heterozygous.    Every child has an independant chance for blue eyes with every "trial" (fertilisation), so to having mulitple children with blue eyes shouldnt be any less rare for these parents as just one with blue eyes. Its like flipping a coin, getting heads on the first toss doesn't reduce the chances of getting heads on the second toss.      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 zeroth    10            zeroth    10    Lepton       Members    10   6 posts             Posted January 27, 2005        well it is independant but you're statistics are a bit rusty, its much less likely to have multiple children with blue eyes    chances of one blue eyed child: 1:2  chances of two blue eyed childs: 1:4  chances of three blue eyed childs: 1:8  chances of four blue eyed childs: 1:16  chances of five blue eyed childs: 1:32      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 rakuenso    11            rakuenso    11    Molecule       Senior Members    11   729 posts   Location:  Toronto              Posted January 30, 2005        maybe this is due to linkage?      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 In My Memory    10            In My Memory    10    Protist       Senior Members    10   949 posts             Posted January 31, 2005        Then it is uncommon, but not weird.

Especially with all the people of mixed races. I myself am japanese and german. and for some reason beyond any known every damn person in my family has brown eyes and dark hair, and they all have glasses, everyone, even the german side. ME on the other hand, i naturally have this odd dull brown/ blonde colour, and i have bluish green eyes and above 30/20 vision. I cant explain it, no one cares to, the point is, i am living proof of how screwed up genetic possibilities can be. so it wouldnt surprise me if you started to see black people with red hair and freckles, and if you saw the whitest person youve ever seen with asian eyes and a dark black afro. to be honest, if i saw an umpa-loompa from willy wonka i wouldnt be surprised. espesscially in canada where if anywhere youll find someone who has a part of some other culture you wouldnt expect.      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Guest kiyoshi            Guest kiyoshi          Guests             Posted May 30, 2005        actually, just to add something, if you take keanu reeves for example, he is like 1/4 japanese, 1/4 hawaiian, 1/2 english, now if you look at him he has brown hair, brown eyes, and if you look at the matrix has like blonde chest hair? would someone care to explain that?!?! cause that just confuzes the hell out of me.      0             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                                 Mag    12            Mag    12    Atom       Senior Members    12   270 posts   Location:  Arizona              Posted May 30, 2005        well it is independant but you're statistics are a bit rusty' date=' its much less likely to have multiple children with blue eyes   chances of one blue eyed child: 1:2  chances of two blue eyed childs: 1:4  chances of three blue eyed childs: 1:8  chances of four blue eyed childs: 1:16  chances of five blue eyed childs: 1:32[/quote']    you sure about those ^    if i remember correctly the chance of ONE blue eyed child was more like 1:4 or more.  I mean, it all depends on the parents.

My twins are 18 months now and they have dark brown eyes and light brown / dirty blonde hair. Never count on baby's features staying the same after birth. It might happen but it's unlikely. And most people who have brown eyes were born with blue and they turn brown in the first. 6 months. It took about 4 months for my girls' eyes to turn brown and it happened over night. :) your baby can look like anything momma and even at birth it's not 100% that those will be baby's features.

If not you child should have brown eyes. If either one of your grandparents passed a recessive trait for blue eyes down to your parents your baby could have a 50/50 chance between brown or blue eyes. m  mamataylor14 @ataylor036  My paternal grandfather has blue eyes and my maternal grandmother has blue eyes and both of his grandparents have blue c  crazylove_bells This is so fun...I could make a guess, but it would probably have no scientific significance lol!  My husband is 1/2 Filipino- dark features and brown eyes... and I'm a blondie with green eyes...our baby came out blond at first lol!  She now has very light brown hair and kept her BLUE eyes! Beautiful with almond shaped eyes :) Ok my guess for your baby...dirty blonde hair with blue eyes! You'll have to keep us updated once baby arrives :) m  mamataylor14 @crazylove_bells  That's awesome! I bet she's beautiful! A friend of mine is African American and her baby came out with bright icy blue eyes! Crazy :) and so pretty! j  jlyons02 Punnett square.. you have to line up you and your DH, but you need to know what traits are dominant and what's recessive.. I know green eyes are recessive so I have 2 recessive genes, and my SO has brown eyes, which is dominant, so our baby will most likely have brown eyes, unless my SO has 1 dominant brown trait and one recessive green, in which case there is 1/4 chance of green eyes. z  zmomma2 I have no idea. But I'm a red head and everyone told me there was no way id get my red headed baby because the gene is so recessive. Well, my girl has a head full of bright red curly hair!! She also has daddy's big brown eyes, which is a rare combination :) She's a pretty even split between all of our features, so I'm curious about number 2! b  blessedmomma12 @mamataylor14  I'm brown/brown and DH is brown/hazel. Our DD has beautiful dark auburn/red hair and blue eyes! Dark eyelashes unlike many lighter red heads. Never would've guessed we'd get a red head bc no parents/grandparents. A couple random great aunts/uncles apparently had red. We love our sweet surprise! G  GiraffeGirl Bb/BB = Brown eyes always bb= Blue Eyes always a person with bb can only produce gametes with "b" a person with BB can only produce gametes with "B" a person with Bb produces gametes with "B" OR "b"  your DH can only produce "b", so your child definitely has at least one "b" i believe that you having hazel eyes is the same genetically as having blue eyes, therefore you only produce "b" as well, which means that your parents are each Bb. so....you are having a blue eyed little one :) k  kwitt318 I think... blue eyes are recessive gene. However with that many you may end up with a blue eyed babe! I believe curly is recessive too, so unless you had curly its unlikely babe will have curly!  I would aim to guess brown hair, but its just a guess! G  GiraffeGirl @GiraffeGirl  to correct myself a bit...genetics refer to "light" and "dark" eyes.  If your eyes are light, you are having a blue eyed baby.  I know people who call their eyes "hazel" but they are really brown. j  jennigiddi @mamataylor14  I don't know the whole dominant recessive thing but I can tell you what I have. I have brown hair now, blonde as a child and hazel eyes. My mom had hazel my dad blue. My husband is 1/2 Japanese so he has dark hair brown eyes. His dad had blue. Our 3 oldest all ended up with blonde hair blue eyes. I do expect their hair to darken through the years. My youngest ended up with the brown eyes and dark hair. Kind of curious to see what this one ends up having. I would've liked 1 to get my eyes. :) c  candicel125 My husband is blue, I'm brown. All 3 of our boys are blue :) m  mamataylor14 These are what I call hazel haha they seem light to me so maybe these with my DG blue eyes we will have a blue eyes girl! :) H  Haleigh4512 Ok mines crazy difficult. Lol My family : grandpa and grandma( maternal ) have blue eyes. Grandma and grandpa (paternal) brown. My mom has green and my dad has brown. I have blue. Hubbys: i have no idea on grandparents (his paternal are 100%Germanic if that helps), his mom has brown his dad has blue and my hubby has brown. So i have no guesses. Lol m  mamataylor14 @jennigiddi  That's so fun! I guess you just never know until they come :)) G  GiraffeGirl @mamataylor14  what beautiful eye balls you have!!!  :)) i would say they are brown from a genetic standpoint....so, you have at least one "B".  you could have a "b" and therefore a blue eyed LO, otherwise, s/he will be "Bb" and beautifuly brown eyed.  :) s  svtbaby Is this applicable to just color of eyes/hair or even kind of hair like curly, wavy or straight? Or shape of the eyes like tiny or big? G  GiraffeGirl @Haleigh4512  you bring a "bb" to the scene and your hubby brings "Bb"...so you have a 50% chance of brown, 50% chance of blue. n  nymommyof3 I have hazel green eyes and brown curly hair.

I'm the only non-blonde with green eyes. The rest are blonde with blue. My dad is brown and brown. According to the 2nd link, I have an 11% chance of a blue-eyed babe. It gave a 0% chance of brown, which I find weird since we do have a brown-eyed child. Reply  Close C  CarrollBaby1 I have a blue eyed blonde hair son right now. Which is funny since it's a small chance of either of those. Reply  Close B  BrittanyLennartz My two boys are blonde like their father with brown eyes like mine.

When my son was born he didn't look like anyone we knew turns out he looks like the one brother of mine that doesn't look much like the rest of my siblings. Genes are cool and can be crazy I'm also excited to see what I get for this one. Reply  Close s  savanntim With my daughter she some how ended up with blue eyes. My hubby and I both have brown. She is the only grandkid on both sides who doesn't have brown. Reply  Close l  lizziepagano Genes are fun and tricky. I'm excited to see what color eyes baby has. My mom has blue, my dad has brown. My half sisters mom also has blue. Sis and I both have blue eyes, so obviously my dad has the blue eyed gene. Hubby has blue eyes and is adopted, so we don't know what color eyes his bio parents had. Will be interesting to see what color eyes he gives our kids haha! We were both honey blonde as kids, darkened to light brown as adults. My whole family is the same, so I'm thinking baby will be fair skinned and light haired like all of us lol Reply  Close M  Mamallama38 I haven't looked at the website yet, but my hubs & I both have brown eyes & brown hair and our daughter has green eyes & blonde hair. Never thought that would happen :) Reply  Close M  Mamallama38 So I did it and my daughter only had a 2% chance of having green eyes and a 12% chance of having blonde hair yet that's what she got! Reply  Close B  BusyBeeMommy10 My grandmother was mainly Portuguese, with dark beautiful olive skin, brown eyes and brown hair. My grandfather was blonde haired, blue eyed and fair. All of their children had blonder hair, lighter skin, except one had brown eyes. Out of 7 only one had the more dominant gene. My mom has blue/green eyes and blonde hair, my father has hazel green eyes and brown very curly hair with darker skin. My moms hair texture is wavy, not straight. They had 5 children, all the girls have blonde hair and a form of blue eyes, dark blue, grey blue and mine are green blue. My brother has brown hair, and honey brown eyes. My other brother passed at 2, but I'm assuming his hair would have changed to brown, and he had very dark chocolate eyes. 2 of my siblings tan very very well, and I turn pink lol. I have freckles. All their kids have pin straight hair, not even kidding. My hubby has dark brown hair and brown eyes. He tans very well. Our son is 5, he has dark brown eyes, but my exact shade of blonde hair. He also has freckles, yet he tans well. Genetics is an amazing thing, but a percent can be just that. It always can go against the odds and surprise people. Reply  Close 3  3tymsLucky hahaha arghhhh im still hoping for one of my bubs to inherit my green eyes! According to the site chances are 10% for blue eyes, 23.3% green eyes & ta dah! 66.6% brown eyes! which is not very suprising lol both my boys have brown eyes and blond hair, one is quite tanned and the other white haha...I am a half caste Cook Islander and New Zealander but my childrens father is a full blooded Cook Islander. My youngest has dimples though! I love dimples :) Reply  Close C  CarrollBaby1 I have blue eyes, blonde hair, and I have olive colored skin. That's exactly what my son has.

You: blue eyes so you will give blue/blue, DH: brown eyes with a blue eyed parent so he will give blue/brown. Possible combinations are Blue (from you)/blue (from DH)=blue Blue (from you)/brown (from DH)=brown y  yesallmine Here's our make up... DH= blue eyes(his mom and dad, blue eyes) Me= brown eyes(my dad blue, my mom brown) 5 of our kids have blue eyes and 2 have brown eyes Your kids could go either way. I will say that my blue eyed babies were much bluer at birth than my brown eyed babies(their eyes were much darker). m  menmybump You can only know for certain what clue eyes your baby will have if you both have blue eyes as that means you both got blue eye genes from both your parents and therefore you can both only pass on blue eye genes. To have blue eyes you have to get blue eye genes from both parents, as Brown is a stronger gene and will win out If your husband has brown eyes but his father has blue eyes then he got a blue eye gene from his father (since his father must have 2 blue eyes genes that's all he could pass on) and a brown eye gene from his mum which won over the blue eyed gene. since you have blue eyes that's the only gene you can pass on but your husband can pass on either so you'll just have to wait and see, and then blame him if it not what you were hoping for :) p  piperchapman My DH and I both have brown hair and hazel eyes and my kid has blond hair, blue eyes. We get a lot of mail man jokes. Since most of both our family's eyes are brown with the random blue or green here and there, I'd say your chances are pretty good for a blue eyed baby... but even if he/she doesn't get the blue gene, I think brown eyes are absolutely gorgeous. T  TipToeTulip72 I have brown eyes & DH has green. DS has blue & DD has brown. My dad had blue eyes & DHs sister & grandpa have blue eyes so it seems like ds got the recessive trait while dd got the more dominant. It really depends on which one of you has the more dominant traits so its all a waiting game. a  aclark143 Thanks everyone!

I would guess brown eyes with brown curly hair!  How fun... Curly hair is soooo cute!  I'm so glad I can put my genetics classes to use here!  I just took a genetics class last semester :) H  Heidimelt @ebby8890  If any of your grandparents have blue eyes then there is a chance you may have the gene but if not then there would only be about a 1% chance of your child having light eyes. If you have only brown (BB) genes to give and your husband has blue (bb) no matter what you would give a (B) and he would give a (b) so baby would have (Bb) and the B=brown would be dominant. Hair can be a little more tricky so could go either way. My husband has black hair and brown eyes and I have blonde and blue, but since his grandma had blonde hair with blue eyes he had the blue eye gene and our son has light hair and eyes. Hope this makes sense. e  ebby8890 @Heidimelt  There has to be the blue eye gene somewhere in my grandparents because my uncle has blonde hair an blue eyes even though my Grandma an grandpa have brown eyes. Im pretty sure my first daughter has hazel eyes but its hard to tell forsure. m  masonsmyworld @ebby8890  If your uncle is blond haired and blue eyed and you're sure that your grandma was faithful (just joking) then your parent (whomever's brother is your uncle) has a 1/4 chance of being a heterozygous (carrier) of the blue eyes AND blond hair. Which means that you would being a brown eyed and brown hair woman (assuming your other parent is not also a carrier of one or both) 1/16 chance of being a carrier for BOTH. And if your hubby is blond and blue eyed you'd have a 1/64 chance of having a blond haired blue eyed baby. That being said, the chances of you having a child that is brown haired and blue eyed is a little different but still up there in low percentages. So if I had to guess, your child will most likely be brown haired, brown eyes and curly hair. Which sounds adorable to me. I could continue to do the math but it's late and pregnancy brain isn't great at this time of night. BTW, great question... that was fun. B  Baby3dueAug14 @masonsmyworld  What a great reply masonsmyworld! Do me!! I have brown hair and blue/green (hazel) eyes. My hubby is blonde and blue eyes. Our two sons are blonde and blue eyes too. I have heard brown hair and eyes are dominate. I do have the blonde/blue gene in my family though. One sister has my hair and eyes. My other sister is blonde and blue. Both my mom and dad are brown and blue. Both grandmother's are brown and either hazel or blue. Both grandfathers blonde and blue. So I'm a little curious what my little girl will have!! It could totally be either way. Though, I can't think of a single person in my family or my husband's family with brown eyes so I'm thinking that's out. I'm more puzzled if she'll have blonde or brown hair. How do you calculate the odds for each?!? R  Rica08152011 Lol... I felt like I was in biology 101 all over again w/ all this talk about dominant/recessive alleles homozygous/heterozygous... And genotype...love it! Anyway, I agree w/ everyone, not knowing your full history that your baby will be Brown/Brown. e  ebby8890 @Rica08152011  If someone asked me about snake genetics I could probably answer but human babies? nah lol A  Allyceo15 I'm interested to see my baby... My side has: Mom-brown hair and eyes Dad brown hair , hazel eyes Brother brown hair n eyes Moms parents both brown hair and eyes Dads mom blonde and blue, grandpa brown amd hazel My uncle is blonde and blue DF is brown and green His brother blonde n blue and sister brown and brown His parents brown and brown, and then his mom is brown n brown d  dragonflii @maggiesue2011  Ooo! Guess mine please! =D DF and I both have actual hazel eyes (as in they change color). My Mom and Dad both had brown eyes, I got my eyes from my maternal grandmother. DF's Mom has blue eyes and his Dad has hazel green, ( i do not know if they change color). I'm pretty sure our baby will have dark hair as we both do. But, what do you think the chances of passing on our hazel eyes? I would really hate it if my parent's brown eyes popped back up! I love our eyes!Â J  Jelly09 @ebby8890  All right people, a lot of you have a great understanding of simple (Mendelian) genetics, but human genetics are often far more complex than what is taught in high school or even a university undergraduate biology course. So I'm a cell biologist/geneticist and I think the key point that is missing in this discussion is that the simple genes people "learned" for eye color in past classes are pretty much just made up. While it does seems to be true that brown eyes are dominant to blue eyes, there seem to be way more than just one or two genes that are involved in eye color (there could be ten or more, we just don't know yet), so right now it is really really hard to predict what eye color one's offspring might have. My DH is a cell biologist as well (both PhDs) and we have both been somewhat surprised with DS's green eyes given that DH's are hazel brown (all his family is brown) and my whole family has blue eyes. But it's a fun game, and we talk about things like this all the time. We're still wondering if one of our kiddos will end up with my red hair, as DH's family is all dark haired, but my two blonde parents had two red-headed kids (my mom's mom was red while her dad was dark-haired, but my two uncles are red!). So far DS appears to be a medium colored brown... who knows! I think human genetics for a lot of these traits are just more complex than we've figured out yet. There are a lot of other traits that we can predict from just the parents (and sometimes grandparents/aunts/uncles/siblings), like the ability to roll one's tongue, blood type, or certain genetic diseases. I'd be happy to chat more about genetics with anyone though, it's really one of my favorite things! I know that makes me such a nerd, but I find it fun because it's a real logic puzzle. p  princess212 @ebby8890  the darker hair and eyes are always dominant my son has a lighter brown hair even though me and hubby have very dark brown and he has even darker then my brown eyes and hubby has blue.  But my best friend is dark hair dark eyes and had a baby with a black guy so obviousy dark skin hair and eyes and her daughter has the most amazing blue eyes you have ever seen and what looks like just a perfectly tanned skin.  So anything really can happen m  masonsmyworld @Baby3dueAug14  So sorry, I just got onto the actual site rather than my phone, so I am just now seeing this. The fact that you have blue/green eyes and that your hubby has blue eyes means that you're little girl will definitely have blue eyes with a slight possibility of the green tint you got. Green is really rare! So jealous, I always wanted green eyes but I got grey ;) Since your parents are both brown haired, but they had a blondie, means that they have to both be heterozygous for the blonde hair color, which means that there was a 25% chance that you could be purely homozygous (BrBr) for brown hair and a 50% chance that you are heterozygous for (BrBl). Since your hubby is blonde he is obviously homozygous (BlBl) as blonde is recessive. That means when you two pair up there is a 50% chance you will have a blonde haired baby. Out of curiosity were you a blondie when you were younger? n  nestingtwo @masonsmyworld  Check out my eye color thread I just posted with a chart to show you the probability of eye  color. :) I posted this with my last pregnancy and it was fun to see all the variations! m  masonsmyworld @Jelly09  oh, I know I simplified it way too much. But like you mentioned, its fun to guess and having had 6 ( I study the biology of cancer, so lots of genetics but I'm no phd) years of genetics its a pretty educated guess ;) though I know mother nature can always throw us for a loop.

It depends on the parents. It should be about 3 out of 16 times, if the parents are heterogeneous for both traits. If both parents have blonde hair, you are certain to be blonde. It is hard to tell with the eyes to know if both parents carry a recessive gene or not. But there is more than genotype to consider here. In this case, if the genes in question determine melanin-making capacity, then this would actually be impossible, since melanin is needed both for eye and hair color. It that case, they might end up with green eyes (blue eyes with a layer of theomelanin).   1 person  found this useful                       Svheia  28 Contributions      What is the likelihood of having a blue-eyed baby with blond hair if the mother and father both have blue eyes with brown hair that was blond from birth-6 years old?  blue eyes very likely, blond hair, not lucky- will turn out brown as brown hair is the dominant allele in a brown-blond pair of alleles (see genetics, hair color, wikipedia).  Hi, no I don't agree because I have brown hair now but I was properly blond til I was 6 years old. Both my parents had brown hair. I am English (and by that I mean properly English - not muslim) and like 90% of ethnically English people, have blond hair when young that darkens with age. This is due to the English race being Germanic and related to the Germans, Danes, Norwegians etc. In the US, there are lots of people with either English or German ancestry - so much the same story there too.   I do not know about English race, ancestors and genetic traits, nor the genetic background of the darkening blond hair, however if both parents have brown hair, it means that they carry at least one dominant gene that expresses brown hair. Still, if both parent have also one recessive allele for blond hair, theoretically there is a 25% chance that their children could be blond haired, and of course with blue eyes.

Most likely the baby will have blue+green mix and you wont know until the baby grows hair it could be any colour but by Mother has blonde hair green eyes and father has brown hair green eyes the baby would probably have dark blonde hair               Mrbc101  3 Contributions      What is the chances of a couple with brown eyes and brown hair having a blond hair and green eyed baby?  It's absolutely possible, and I am living proof of it. The chances are extremely slim though, because both the trait for blond hair and the traits for green eyes are recessive.   Green eyes are the rarest eye color, because green eyes are not only recessive to the brown eyes trait but also recessive even to blue eyes. I couldn't give exact odds, because the process of genetic recombination is random, but if both traits existed somewhere earlier in the family line, (one parent or more is a carrier) then the combination is not impossible. Even with blond haired people, most tend to exhibit either blue eyes or brown because of green's recessiveness to the two. Having the most recessive eye color trait and the second rarest hair color in the world appear together in one person is exceptionally rare though, but still possible.               Teledain  4,388 Contributions      Your boyfriend has brown hair and hazel eyes and you have blonde hair and brown eyes what color eyes and hair will your baby have?  The possible hair colors are:    brown, blond, auburn, red, strawberry blond    This is because your boyfriend has more than just a "brown" gene; it's just that the other genes aren't expressed because brown is dominant.    The possible eye colors are:    brown, green, blue, hazel    Again this is because both of you have more than just the expressed gene, and your baby may have a combination of genes from each of you that are not expressed but still present.    Statistically, it's slightly more likely the baby will have brown eyes and brown hair--but it shouldn't be surprising at all if the baby has any of the other hair and eye colors.               Swit adi  7 Contributions      If a man had blue eyes and black hair and the woman had blue eyes blond hair There child came out to be blond hair and brown eyes?  It can't be. The blue eyes gene is recessive! to have blue eyes youmust get the TWO RECESSIVE gens from your parents: aa . brown eyes gene is dominant (AA or Aa). So if the two parents haveblue eyes, their children, their children will be blue eyed aswell. aa and aa can't create Aa or AA.            If a man had black hair and blue eyes and the woman had blond hair blue eyes can the child come out with brown eyes blond hair if the grandmother had brown eyes?  Blue eyes are a recessive trait. If at least one of the parents had a blue/hazel eyes with a mixture of blue and brown, then the couple's offspring could have brown eyes. If both parents had solid blue eyes, neither would have the dominant brown gene to pass to the baby, and it would have blue eyes, regardless of the grandmother's eye color.               MeetRosie  3 Contributions      If you have brown hair and brown eyes and your boyfriend has brown hair and brown eyes what are the chances that your kid would have blonde hair and blue eyes?  This is unlikely since brown eyes are a dominant gene and so is brown hair. Blonde hair and blue eyes are a recessive gene.  If one of your parents have blue eyes/brown hair, or one of his, then there is still a chance you will have a child with blonde hair and blue eyes.  If both of you have a parent with blonde hair and blue eyed, there is actually a 25% chance of having a child with this combination.  If not, the chances are much less.  However, it isn't possible to know whether your genotype (the actual traits one carries) contains this trait since it isn't a dominant trait and doesn't necessarily manifest itself in the individual.               Teledain  4,388 Contributions      If both parents have brown hair and eyes can there baby have blond hair and blue eyes?  Yes, if the parents are brown-blond for hair (which will appear brown because it is dominant over blond), the baby can get one blond from each parent and be blond-blond (which will appear blond). Similar, if the parents are brown-blue for eyes (which will appear brown because it is dominant over blue), the baby can get one blue from each parent and be blue-blue (which will appear blue).               Phillips313  1 Contribution      How will you know what color eyes and hair will your baby haveif the father has brown hair and brown eyes and the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes?  \nbrown eyes are dominant over blue eyes. hair colors can mix, or be one or the other. for both, you need to go further back in both your gene pools for more evidence.               Down123  1 Contribution      What color eyes and hair will a baby have if the father has black hair and brown eyes and the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes?  Thats EXACTLY me! My parents have that. I have tanned skin, green/hazel eyes & black hair.            What color hair and eyes will your baby have the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes and the father has brown hair and green eyes?  it will probably have dirty blonf hair or a light brown hair colour and probably blueish green eyes but its hard to b sure               Akiko Fujishima  22 Contributions      How can your baby have blonde hair and blue eyes when the mother has brown hair and hazel eyes and the father has brown hair air and brown eyes?  Genetics is quite tricky. Traits from family members many generations past can show up in the child of a mother with brown hair and eyes, and father having brown hair and hazel eyes. Many times, the child's hair and eyes will darken as they get older. From a personal experience, I had attended school with a boy that had both pale blond hair and blue eyes. By the time he was 12, his hair was very dark brown and he had brown eyes. I think humans tend to think only the parents have an effect on the genetics of a child.. but that just is not the case. There have also been findings in two, thought to be, Caucasian parents having a child with very dark skin... they way genetics work is completely unpredictable.               Maxiogee  32,371 Contributions      If a mother and father both had brown hair and brown eyes what are the odds that they would have two blond hair blue eyed children?  \nLight hair and eye colour are what is known as 'recessive' - that is, one can carry the gene for them and yet not have them. These can then be passed on to children. If two children have the same features then it is likely that both parents are carrying the recessive genes. "Recessive" just means that someone in the person's ancestry had these hair and eye colour. Blue eyes often accompany blond hair.               Cathy Weldon  25 Contributions      What color eyes and hair will a baby have if the father has blond hair and blue eyes and the mother has black hair and dark brown eyes?  the eyes wont be as dark but there is only a one out of three chance they will be green or blue. the hair is probably going to be a shade of brown               Redbaronpizza  10 Contributions      What color hair will the baby have if the father has dark brown hair and brown eyes and the mother has blond hair and green eyes?

There are several pages on the WWW that can help you to determine the probability of your unborn child eye colors.\n.

Myguyroxs  35 Contributions      You have red hair hazel eyes and your boyfriend has brown hair brown eyes but your daughter has very blonde hair and blue eyes How is this possible?  well somewhere down your family tree or his family tree there is proubuly a couple of people who have blonde hair and blue eyes, like my BF has blonde hair and her mom dad and sibblings have brown so it is all with genes.               Lisamc57  22,380 Contributions      I have blonde hair and brown eyes but my dad is naturally dark haired would brown suit me as i am blonde and have brown eyes?  I would say yes.. 
Because of your own rown eyes I would say yes. But I wouldn't go dark. You should get some brown low lights and see how you feel before you dye all your hair.               Shannonjenkins1  5 Contributions      If you have blue eyes and blond hair and you dye your hair brown can it change the color of you eyes?  No, It's impossible, Your eyes will always stay the same colour even iff you've dyed your hair black to ginger! So don't worry you'll keep your blue eyes!!               Sam c jones  2,330 Contributions      What are the chances of a baby having blond hair and blue eyes if the father has black hair and brown eyes and the mother has black hair and hazel eyes?  Unfortunately very slim. It all depends on your background. If any of you have had blood relatives who have had either of these traits, it is possible.   However, if not then the chances are extremely rare, maybe even unlikely.. 
another answer... this can occur from ones grandparents genes as their genes may still be with ones parents even if their hair and eyes are unalike in colour. Or theres a milkman involved               Saskia Zaal  34 Contributions      What color hair and eye will a baby have if the father has strawberry blonde hair and brown eyes and the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes?  It will have no eyes. So there!   The child probably will have a lighter haircolour, and it can have both brown eyes and blue eyes,            How come your dad has blue eyes blond hair mom has hazel brown eyes and one brother has blue eyes blond hair and the other has green eyes blond hair why do you have brown hair and dark brown eyes?  I don't know how much you know about genes, but there are dominant genes and recessive genes, and you only get two genes (a person could get two dominants or two recessives or one dominant and one recessive). 
To explain it better, here is a scenario:  The father has a dominant blue eye gene + a recessive dark brown eye gene and two blond hair genes,  While the mother has a dominant blond hair gene + a recessive brown hair gene and has a dominant hazel eye gene and a recessive green eye gene.  Those two people have three kids: two have blond hair, one inherits his father's blue eye gene while the other inherits his mother's recessive green eye gene (leading to the first having blue eyes and the second having green eyes), and the last inherits his/her father's recessive dark brown gene and the mother's brown hair gene.    If you look at old photographs you might find some grandparents have the same dark brown eyes or brown hair as you.            Why does Justin Biebers hair blond but his eye brows brown?  justin does not have blonde hair its brown and it sometime just looks brown because of the light. btw his hair is amazing and so is his voice               Moobot  1,037,496 Contributions      What color eye and hair will a baby have if the mother has red hair and brown eyes and the father has blond hair and blue eyes?  I Would Say Red Hair With Brown Eyes,. Brown Eyes Dominate Over Blue Eyes And Red Over Blonde,   I Could Be Wrong, But Im Learning That In Science At The Moment So That's My Guess.               Dontstopbelieving  16 Contributions      What color eyes and hair will a baby have if the mother has dirty blond hair blue eyes and the father has light brown hair blue eyes?  It depends on the mother's and father's recessive genes. The baby may have blue eyes, but if the mother's mother's eyes are brown, the baby's eyes may be brown.            What color eyes and hair will a baby most likely have if the mother has black hair and brown eyes and the father has blond hair and blue eyes?  It is very likely that this baby will have black hair and brown eyes, yet there is a chance that it could have blonde hair and blue eyes but I doubt it.   Blond hair is uncommon compared to black hair. Blue eyes are also uncommon compared to brown eyes.            How common is blond hair and brown eyes?  I happen to have blonde hair and dark hazel eyes, and ive only met a couple other people who have similar characteristics but it is possible genetically, but rare. More than half of the natural blondes in the world are born with blue eyes.               AliceCullenInsanity  24 Contributions      Does Justin bieber like blonde hair and brown eyes?  Justin does not really care about hair i never heard him saying he does not like blonde's looks for a girl with nice smile and nice eyes and can make him laugh also said he would not mind if she was just funny .  . 
Let me say that he probably doesn't care. This is a matter of opinion and unless he tells us, we will never know. I just removed the first comment because it is EXTREMELY biased. I mean, don't you know that you have to have a reliable source for this stuff?            Both parents have brown eyes and hair have a blue eyed blond baby what is the chance of next baby having blond hair and blue eyes?  Well, it depends whether or not they have the recessive gene or not. If both parents have the recessive gene, then 1/4. If neither of them have that recessive gene, then it's not possible.            If a guy has blonde hair and blue eyes and a girl has blonde hair and brown eyes what would their baby look like?  Blonde hair and blue or brown eyes, there's no definite way of knowing before the baby is born.               Saskia Zaal  34 Contributions      If a man has brown hair and brown eyes and the woman has blonde hair and blue eyes can they have a blonde hair blue eye baby?  I believe so as long as the brown hair/brown eyed man carries the blonde/blue eye genes. both are recessive so they won't show up in the man, but if he has a parent or grandparent w/ blonde hair or blue eyes, it is somewhat likely. If the man has a sibling with brown hair or blue eyes it is more likely because it means both his parents have those recessive genes. Essentially, because the woman's genes in this case are recessive, the man's genes will determine the hair and eyes of the child.   Yes they can, but the man has to be heterozygous, so the dominant one and the recessive one,            What color eyes and hair will a baby have if mother has blonde hair hazel eyes father has dark brown hair brown eyes grandmother has blonde hair green eyes and grandfather has blonde hair hazel eyes?  Two alleles are responsible for determining both eye color and hair color. The allele for brown hair is dominant over the allele for blonde hair. The allele for brown eyes is dominant over the allele for blue eyes.    If the organism presents with the dominant allele it can either be homozygous or heterozygous. But if it presents with either blonde hair and/or blue eyes it is homozygous for the recessivge alleles.    Hazel, green and brown are all mutations of eye color but from the same allele that is responsible for brown eyes - so with the alleles there are really only to classes of eye color brown and blue - and if your not blue eyed your under brown eyes.    Letting; H = brown hair and h = blonde hair and E = brown eyes and e = blue eyes    Mother Blonde = hh Hazel = EE/Ee   Father Brown = HH/Hh Brown = EE/Ee    I assume the grandparents are from the mothers side because 2 natural blondes should only have blonde children naturally.    1/4 chance of baby being blonde 1/12 will have blue eyes     Another answer   It's very possible that a child could have red hair also with those genes. I have many family members that have a red headed child.               Heather Bear  47 Contributions      How do guys feel about blond curly hair and brown eyes?

What is the best eyeshadow color for a girl with brown-blonde hair and brown eyes?  Lucky for you, brown eyes look best in the most eyeshadow colours. But specifically, what looks the best on brown eyes is gold, green, and purple. On an everyday basis, I would recommend the gold. The best gold to wear is an antique gold, meaning one that has a green tone to it. I have one and I get the most complements on my actual eyes, not just my eyeshadow, when I wear it. It's amazing on brown eyes. Hope this helps!               Madeleine Friesen  23 Contributions      Does blond hair look good with brown eyes?  Yes it does.

The connection between hair color and eye color isirrelevant; they are controlled by different genes.  If you are a child, being blond is not unusual. Often, the hairwill darken later, possibly to a light brown.  It is true, that brown eyes is more dominant over blue and green, Iwas born with platinum blonde hair, and even now my hair is still alight-ish blonde, and I have brown eyes. Blonde hair and browneyes, is actually the third rarest hair and eye color combination,in the world, next to red hair and green (blue) eyes, and blackhair and green eyes. So, it's not completely RARE, but it isn'tcommon.

What color eyes and hair will a baby have if the father has brown hair and blue eyes the mother has blonde hair and blue eyes?  It is possible for the baby to have any hair color, because it may receive genes for the recessive trait (blonde hair, or even red hair) in preference to the dominant trait (brown hair). The likelihood is strong that the baby will have blue eyes, since both parents have the recessive gene.

Usually, the pigments in your eyes, hair and skin are about the same. That's why you usually see people with naturally light hair (blonde, red) that have blue or green eyes and fair skin. Dark colored eyes are also dominant traits, so if a person has one parent with blue eyes and one with brown eyes, the child will most likely (about 75% chance) have brown eyes.
