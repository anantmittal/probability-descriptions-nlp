Fear of house mice is actually a very appropriate reaction, though, because they often carry disease. Contact with the urine, droppings or saliva of infected mice; mouse-contaminated food;or bites from the fleas they carry can spread serious illness such as salmonellosis, listeria, hantavirus and even the bubonic plague . Therefore it is wise to keep mice out of your home if at all possible and to get rid of them ASAP when they do happen to make their way inside. When Do Mice Infest Human Residences? Contrary to its name, the house mouse tends to live in fields or forests. However, these rodents invade 21 million American homes annually when the weather gets cold or their food supply is disturbed, especially in the case of exceptionally severe weather conditions. One side effect of 2012’s devastating Hurricane Sandy was large numbers of displaced mice, which sought food and shelter inside human dwellings in New York and New Jersey. Newark rodent control was a serious concern. Stacks of firewood, compost heaps and untrimmed grass or bushes adjacent to your house are the perfect hiding place for mice, and from there it’s only a hop, skip and a jump inside. Set up woodpiles and compost heaps away from your home (minimum 20 feet) and keep all foliage well groomed. Do not allow debris to pile up near your home. What Are the Signs of Infestation? If your home does become infested, unless you are in total denial, chances are it won’t take long to find out. Mice leave plenty of evidence of their presence, including shredded paper, gnawed wires, the smell of urine and droppings which resemble pointed black grains of rice. (BTW, the average mouse can scatter as many as 80 droppings throughout your home every day – yuck!) Even if you don’t actually come across a mouse nest, you are very likely to hear rustling and squeaking in the walls, particularly at night. When you are harboring a sizable rodent population, you may even encounter a bold mouse out exploring your living room. What Do Mice Eat? Surprisingly, cheese is not their favorite food. Mice love grain, cereals and baked goods such as bread and crackers. They also have a fondness for chocolate. If you are baiting traps , strong-smelling foods such as bacon or peanut butter are generally recommended. Because mice are capable of chewing through materials ranging from paper to plastic, it is best to store any foods with mouse appeal in glass or metal containers – or in the fridge. Is it Possible to Have Just One Mouse in My Home? Although you might wish it were otherwise, you will almost never find “only one mouse” in a home.  Females mature at the age of 2 months and produce approximately 8 litters of a dozen pups , as their young are called, per year. That’s about 100 in total! What Are Some Unsuccessful Mouse Control Methods? Housecats are not an effective means of mouse control. In fact, mice often are attracted to leftover food in or around your pet’s dish. (They also enjoy spilled birdseed and dry dog food.) Glue traps are another inadvisable method of dealing with a mouse infestation. While at first glance they may seem more humane than snap traps, you are left with the problem of handling a flimsy contraption stuck tight to a terrified, angry rodent which is very much alive. Please don’t ask me how I know. What Does Work? Poisoned bait, snap traps and “catch and release” traps (one of which is even approved by PETA ) are successful methods of getting rid of house mice. If you set out poisoned bait, be sure to place it next to the wall or other edge, where mice like to travel, and keep it out of reach of children and pets. To prevent further problems, stop mice from getting back inside. Cover exterior vents with metal screening and seal up other potential mouse entry points – for example, cracks in your foundation and gaps under exterior doors.

Justanotherone wrote: I live in ny state. it's cold and snowy and most houses are bound to get mice in them in the winter. I have been bad lately and keeping the kitchen clean, it's not filthy just cluttered with a few crumbs here or there. every time I clean the kitchen I find a few droppings, about 4 or 5, 2-3 in two separate spots on the counter. I clean the kitchen lately maybe once every two weeks. for the first time, I actually found bread thst had been chewed through. now let me ask, how can I tell if it's just one mouse or a dozen? when our kitchen is clutter free for a week, I usually don't see any droppings. it takes a week and a half before I see droppings after I've cleaned. I'm not trying to sound naive but that few droppings in such a long time, I'm guessing there's maybe one or two and that's it. I'm also trying to figure how to get rid of then since I know the place they're hiding I can't get to (und er the counters). any idea how to tell if it's a sole mouse or a few? and how to grt rid of then when you have 2 dogs and a toddler in the house, and a mommy who's allergic to cats (me) ??? I'm just trying to figure what to do, my fiance is not concerned at all, but I'm thinking about that hauntavirus that they carry... Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  57 Posts A  AllyM24 @Justanotherone  Set traps w  wouch I think the only way you can tell is by trapping it/them. If you only catch one and the droppings stop, then it might be just one.  That would be very unlikely though. j  jennnayyy @Justanotherone  I would set traps. They make some where you can catch the mice alive and just let them go in a park away from your home. It's less messy and you don't have to deal with icky mice in your kitchen. d  danisteph @Justanotherone  We got a few in our basement last winter due to a small hole where a pipe running into the house sank into the ground. Pest guy said they can't take a few steps without leaving several droplets. They breed and multiply pretty fast. When you set out traps wear rubber gloves. Never touch the traps because if your scent is on them they won't go anywhere near them. That's all I remember, good luck! j  jtyme921 You clean your kitchen once every 2 weeks? Gross n  nanismama @Justanotherone  My mom would always say that one mouse is the equivalent of many mice. You might want to get some traps or call someone to come inspect for rodents. You should also clean your kitchen more often. That's the one place I clean once a day if not twice. Rodents carry so many diseases...would not want them around our food! S  Sibby33 @Justanotherone  They say were there's one there's more. What kind of dogs do you have that they don't hunt the mice? You should probably set traps. Maybe clean out all of your cabinets and use a flashlight to find any areas where mice can get in or you could take everything out and line your cabinets with hard aluminum. Nice won't chew threw it. n  nanismama @Justanotherone  I just re-read your post and you mention you have pets and a toddler...we had a horrendous rat infestation in our attic (had to get all new insulation, major cleaning and trapping - yuck!) Anyway, we contacted the local public health Vector Control - not sure if it's called the same in NY but they placed child/pet proof traps in our yard. So I know that there are options out there besides the little snap ones! j  jtyme921 @Sibby33  My lab/pit mix is scared of mice. And frogs. And her shadow. My min pun used to catch them in the alley behind the house and try to bring them to us as gifts. He was so quick, they didn't stand a chance. S  Sibby33 @jtyme921  Your dog made me giggle! Lol we had a cat like that. I'd see about the traps that are safe for babes and toddlers. To bad your pups aren't more of assistances! s  shesafullonmonet For every one that you see, there are seven more you don't see, I would get on that quick before you're dealing with an infestation K  Kaeluminati @Justanotherone  Where there's one, there's more unfortunately. Set some traps. I've used the ones that there's a trap door so they can't get back out and you don't have to see it yuck. Bait them with peanut butter. And clean your damn kitchen!! You have a kid and pets, cleanliness should be of the utmost importance. Make sure all food is sealed tight, no spills or crumbs, floors should be swept/mopped etc. put your bread in the fridge or airtight container so mice can't get it. Make a habit of cleaning after dinner. M  Mrs.H2U @Justanotherone  We got them when we moved Into a house surrounded by woods. There are always more than one. I got on amazon and for about $30 got a plug in mice/spider/bug thingy. I don't remember what it's called but you plug it in (put it on animal safe for the dogs ears) and it send electrical pulses throughout the house. Never had another problem with the mice or spiders. And since it chases everything out you don't have to clean up dead mice. A  Angelah2016 @Justanotherone  Why did I have to read this post? I have a mouse phobia. Even reading this gave me chills down my spine! V  VikiOct2014 @Justanotherone  You need to clean more often. Especially with a baby and pets. The last thing you need is a mouse biting your baby. I suggest you get someone to deep clean the kitchen and the rest of the house. Then set sticky traps on the floor and close the door overnight. f  ftm_gen @Justanotherone  Having dealt with quite a serious mouse problem when I used to rent, my advice is call in the professionals immediately, before things get worse. They'll multiply faster than you can trap them. And with a little one in the house who is probably still in the getting into everywhere and touching everything phase, I mean those things spread all kinds of bacteria. An exterminator may be able to tell you where they're coming from also, so you can patch up the access(es). And finally, while a couple of dishes in the sink is not the end of the world, always pick up food messes right away and store food on your counter in containers or a bread box. T  TormundLives In my experience, seeing one mouse almost always means there are more.  It is similar to brown recluses and ants.  There is hardly ever just one brown recluse or one ant lurking around.   You can get a better feel for how many there are by setting traps.  If you catch multiple mice or a different one every night, then you have your answer.  If you have multiple mice, the easiest way to get rid of them is to call an exterminator, but that can be expensive.  You can always catch and release them, but that is time consuming and they often come back. My brother and SIL once had a nest of mice in the crawl space under their house.  They eventually had to fill in the crawl space to get rid of them.  They can be a real nuisance. s  samcro21 we live in the country surrounded by woods so we have had mice. my husband used spray foam around the hole for my dishwasher they were getting in and we haven't seen one since. my best advice is alternating trap types. if we used a wood snap trap and stopped catching mice, I switched to a house trap, or a plastic snap trap, or a glue trap. in my experience it keeps it so they don't get used to seeing it and know what it is. C  CoffeeMakinTitties 1. Clean your kitchen a lot more often especially with mouse droppings around, ew! 2. Set traps out regularly. 3. Look for holes and places where they are coming in and plug them. 4. Problem solved. Surprising what a little common sense and proactive approach can achieve.

Everything I've read since leads me to believe that if you have one mouse then you have a houseful. Since then I've left the traps and poison down just in case, but no sign of anything. So I was just wondering, am I kidding myself that this was just a Lone Ranger or am I likely to find more?       Add message | Report    mineofuselessinformation   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:11:22    Leave the traps down for two weeks. If you haven't caught any more then, it was probably the only one. (I used to live in a house backing on to fields and had a pretty awful summer when I caught upwards of twelve!)       Add message | Report    SloanePeterson   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:11:52    We had one mouse last Christmas. I was convinced I was going mad as I was having a very stressful time and kept seeing something dashing along the walls out of the corner of my eye. Seriously convinced I was going nuts, and sow as dh who none the less agreed to put some mouse traps down. The next day I heard it snap and found a fat little mouse caught in it. I went into serious de-mouse the house mode and cleaned EVERYTHING, I found it had climbed into a drawer downstairs and chewed a pencil and a tiny chocolate to shreds. I put traps absolutely everywhere, baited with chocolate and haven't caught another since. No more dropping either, which I discovered along the skirting boards, hidden by our hideous carpet until I knew to look for them. I've kept some traps set up, and dotted cotton wool balls doused in peppermint oil in the corners of rooms, which apparently they hate. Also used some expander foam far too liberally on any gaps. I actually think our mouse came in in our Christmas tree box, rather than make its way into the house as we bought it from a local large charity shop that kept the trees undercover but outside. So in out case, yes it was just one mouse. I am seriously dreading winter though as it really did affect me finding that bloody mouse and dread it happening again. I couldn't relax.       Add message | Report    Noodlesoup1976   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:22:48    Thank you. I've literally had the house upside down and inside out and can't find any signs of mouse droppings or gnawing, it was just in the one corner of my bedroom where I caught it.

I'll lay traps and once I've caught it/them I see no signs of mice for ages after. You can tell when you have mice. The houseful thing is a myth.

Add message | Report    shabbs   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:35:41    About five years ago we were going on holiday to Rhodes. We overslept slightly and the taxi was early....cue running around and out of the door. When we came home two weeks later, I quickly noticed that some of my kitchen flooring had been chewed and one of my brand new trainers had been half eaten??? The next night I walked into my kitchen and saw what I first thought was a mouse.....it ran down the side of the cooker and I watched horrified at the verrrrry long tail....yep it was a rat....<<shudder>> we live in a row of terraced house that all share cavity walls and the rat, rats, millions of rats, were having a ball going in and out of everyones kitchen!!!! The next night I did the same (fuelled on Ouzo) walked into the kitchen and saw the tail!!! I decided, with the aid of the Ouzo that I was going to kill it lol.......could see it down the side of the washing machine....it ran out and I grabbed the first thing to hand - fly/wasp spray lol. I tried spraying it on the rat which then jumped about a foot in the air - which, in my drunken state, I tried to kick it!!!!! Next day we got the 'council rat catcher' in and he was more than slightly amused at my ouzo/fly spray incident. It took about a month before all the houses were rat free. Incidentally when they have eaten poison and have died it smells like garlic and onions. Im sure mice are not as bad as rats <<itches, stands on a chair and gets the fly spray out>>       Add message | Report    Noodlesoup1976   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:47:15    Haha Shabbs I actually used to have 2 pet rats, they were lovely boys.

We had one downstairs a couple of years ago - it made a right racket every evening, in and out of the kitchen bins and racing across the living room. Eventually I caught it in a humane trap, and let it go a few streets away by the posh houses Never heard another sound, so it was clearly a lone wolf mouse.       Add message | Report    Thatsmeinthecorner2016   Sun 18-Sep-16 00:15:38    A mouse is normally never alone. I know it's not a consolation but it's a fact. Despite the presence of fields behind us, no mouse in our house really wants to be there. They're all toys brought in by the chubby monster currently sleeping at the end of my bed or the little street thug currently spreading mayhem amongst the local rodents. But before them, in the previous house we had mice and they were definitely a big family as we were catching them one by one. That said, I love pet rats and used to have pet mice but I prefer the grey variety dead.       Add message | Report    Arfarfanarf   Sun 18-Sep-16 00:32:22    Do you have a cat?

He didn't. The pest control people laid traps in the loft and caught dozens over a period of several months. Apparently they must have been scrambling up a climber against NDN's house wall and getting in via a hole under the eaves and into the neighbour's loft. From there they were working their way into his loft as well.       Add message | Report    CrepeDeChineWag   Sun 18-Sep-16 01:13:51    YABU This is not a Highlander situation.       Add message | Report    WiddlinDiddlin   Sun 18-Sep-16 03:17:38    One mouce = lots of mice. Mice really don't come in ones. Make sure the traps and bait trays are in the right places, rodents really don't like new objects and they don't like to come off their paths and trails (one reason they almost constantly dribble wee is that it leaves a scent trail for others to follow). So the fact you haven't caught any or bait hasn't been disturbed does not automatically mean you only had the one mouse - it could mean you put them in the wrong places or that they are still too new for the mice to investigate, or that they don't NEED to bother because they have enough food thanks very much..

Add message | Report    WhateverWillBe   Sun 18-Sep-16 08:22:11    I think it depends on where they come from. I regularly have a lone mouse (or rat, once)...about once every 3 months or so. But I know that's because DCat has a penchant for catching them, bringing them in and releasing them. We put traps dow,n, catch it really quickly and then hear nothing for the next few months until he does it again.      Add message | Report    AnUtterIdiot   Sun 18-Sep-16 09:45:56    If you live in town and have no pets, it is unlikely that you only have one mouse. If you live more rurally and/or you have dogs or cats, you might just have the one you've seen. They're quite savvy around traps. My town mice licked the peanut butter off my traps without ever getting caught. In the end we existed in a state of armed neutrality as the landlord refused to do anything about it ("all Victorian houses have mice").

Here’s what you need to know about them and how to get rid of them. They can make you very sick  Story continues below             Related       What you need to know about home insulation         What you need to know about LED bulbs         What you need to know about furnace filters         Make your home safer with these 5 tips         Hantavirus case confirmed in central Alberta           While the common house mouse is not as dangerous to your health as a deer mouse, they can still spread disease, such as hantavirus , salmonellosis and listeria through their urine, droppings, saliva and nesting materials. These diseases can be deadly, and if you have a major infestation in your home the risk factor of catching one increases. They multiply fast No home ever has just one mouse and don’t be fooled into thinking otherwise. Mice can breed year-round with one female able to produce five to 10 litters per year. With an average of six to eight babies per litter, a family of six mice can multiply into 60 over the course of three months. They can destroy your home It might sound overly dramatic saying a mouse can burn your house down, but the bottom-line is they can . Mice love chewing on wires and when they are in your walls and attic — with full access to your household electrical wiring — you better believe they are nibbling away. They do this to keep their teeth short as well as to gain access to places the wires may be blocking (such as the hole a wire runs through). Once a wire becomes bare the chance of it sparking a fire increases. According to the Illinois Dept. of Public Health , 25 per cent of all fires attributed to “unknown causes” in the U.S. are most likely started by rodents. Mice can also chew through soft concrete, wood (structure and furniture), drywall, rubber, plastic pipes, insulation , aluminum, and even gas lines . They will always find a way inside Mice can fit through spaces much smaller than they appear (think the size of a dime). Holes and cracks in your foundation and outer walls are prime entry points, as are doorways and areas around windows, chimneys, roof vents and wherever pipes and wires enter your home. They can also jump, climb and swim , making it nearly impossible to prevent them from getting inside. They will eat anything As mentioned above, mice will chew and eat through anything. They especially love grains and can make their way through a box of cereal or crackers without much effort. They also eat between 15 and 20 times a day and will make their nest near a food source (think your kitchen or pantry). The health department for the Region of Durham, Ont., says mice contaminate about 10 times more food than they eat . Eating food that a mouse has contaminated is a surefire way of contracting a disease from them. WATCH: Staff at Alberta care home find mice nibbling dementia patient’s face        Signs you have mice If you have discovered mouse droppings or nesting material, heard noises in your walls or attic (mostly at night), or have seen signs of food packaging being chewed, you most likely have mice in your home. Cleaning up after mice Because of the risk of disease associated with mice, cleaning up their nesting or spots they have defecated and urinated on is a process that should not be taken lightly. Vacuuming and sweeping mouse droppings is a big no-no as it can release more bacteria into the air and the dust can make you very ill. Always wear a mask and latex or vinyl gloves while cleaning up mouse-infected spots. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends spraying the area with a commercial disinfectant or mixture of bleach and water and letting it sit for five minutes before using paper towels to wipe the area clean. Once you are done, put the dirty paper towels into a plastic bag and place them in your outside garbage. You should then clean and disinfect the entire area. Food items that have been chewed through should be immediately thrown into your outside garbage. For more on the proper way to clean up after mice, visit the CDC’s website at cdc.gov . How to get rid of mice Once you detect you have mice it’s best to deal with them right away so the chance of damage and disease spreading become less of a concern. The most common DIY methods of ridding your home of mice are snap traps and poison pellets or bait stations . Traps should be set and placed in areas around your home where you have detected mice. For best results, forget the cheese and use a piece of cracker with peanut butter in the trap. Check the traps daily and wear a pair of vinyl or latex gloves to release any dead mice trapped. Dead mice should be put in a plastic bag and placed in the outside garbage immediately. NOTE: If you have children in the house place the traps in areas they cannot get to. Poison pellets and bait stations can be placed inside kitchen and bathroom cabinets, attics, basements, and anywhere else you have detected mice. Most poison pellets and bait stations for mice are safe for household pets and children but use caution and follow the directions on the package. Ultrasonic sound devices, such as the PestChaser line from Victor , use an electronic tone that creates “intensely stressful conditions for rodents” in turn forcing them away from your home. These come in different sizes depending on whether you want a single room or an entire floor of a house or apartment covered. The sound that is emitted can only be heard by rodents and won’t bother you or your pets. WATCH: Rodent Prevention Using UltraSonic Repellents If you have a big infestation or find traps and poison are not working fast enough, call a pest control company to come in. Prevention Prevention is key to stopping mice from continuing to get inside your home. Checking the perimeter of your home and sealing any holes or cracks, as well as clearing away any piles of wood, leaves or other debris near your foundation walls, will make it more difficult for them to gain entry. Caulk around doors, windows and wherever wires and pipes enter. Check your roof and roof vents for damage or holes and fix as needed. Keeping your gutters clean is also helpful. Inside your home, store your dry goods (including cat and dog food) in hard plastic or glass containers with a tightly sealed lid. This will ensure your food does not get contaminated and help cut down on the risk of contracting a disease. Take garbage out frequently and don’t leave open food out on your counters as this can also attract mice. SOUND OFF: Do you have any tips on getting rid of or preventing mice from entering your home?

Discussion in ' After Hours Lounge (Off Topic) ' started by Bob McLaughlin , Jul 27, 2005 .            1    Jul 27, 2005                Bob McLaughlin  Screenwriter      Joined:  Aug 14, 2000    Messages:  1,129    Likes Received:  3    Trophy Points:  110    Real Name:  Bob          I have 3 cats who only unite when they are killing or eating something. The other day I walked down into my basement theater and saw all three cats staring under my theater seat risers. I thought they chased a spider under there, so I got a yardstick and pushed it under there. Next thing I know, a mouse pops out. I grabbed it with a towel and threw it outside.  My wife says there's no such thing as one lone mouse but I really think this is a freak occurrence. We have three very aggressive cats so I think a mouse would be crazy to take up residence in our house. The only reason I think this one came inside at all was because we had left the cat food out for several days while we were on a 3-day weekend vacation. Right before we left, my wife dished them up some canned cat food that we never usually serve them, as a treat. Ironically I think it was the catfood that attracted the mouse. We usually only put out their food for a few minutes at a time.  I've checked for any obvious holes or nests in the house but to no avail. I've heard that a mouse can squeeze through a hole the size of a dime. I believe it, that sucker was tiny! But I haven't heard any mouse noises and the cats aren't acting weird, so I think this was an anomaly. Anyone out there have any mouse stories they'd like to share? Is there such thing as getting just one mouse?

He had built a nest in my kitchen cabinet tucked way up under the counter. A great spot, really. Dark, quiet, warm from the dishwasher. It was all packed with Kleenex, dryer lint, and bits of yarn from some of the cat toys.  We caught him with a mouse-friendly trap and drove him to a far-off field.  Usually it's in the fall when mice are looking to move someplace warm and indoors. A lot of times they'll make their way through a dryer vent or a hole in a window screen.  Keep an eye out... since you didn't take him far away.. he may come back.            5    Jul 27, 2005                Inspector Hammer!

Though the saying "If there's one, there's usually more" is true in a lot of cases. I know there's mice in my house, though I don't usually see them unless I see my cats playing with one or find a dead one that they left as a present on the floor or in the tub.

Consequently, they may cause severe damage to crops and domestic gardens. Although it is commonly believed that mice are attracted to cheese, they tend to prefer foods that are higher in carbohydrates. Chocolate may be more effective attractant for mice than cheese. However, house mice are indiscriminate and will consume any food source available to them. They commonly disturb trashcans in search of food and are capable of surviving for long periods with very little food.  In times of starvation, mice have even been known to exhibit cannibalistic behavior. Females may consume their offspring, and some mice may consume their own tails. However, this behavior is generally only exhibited when under duress.  Mice may also gnaw on other, seemingly inedible materials. Electrical wiring, cardboard boxes, paper and other household items may exhibit chew marks. However, this destruction is caused as a result of the mouse’s nesting habits. Mice live and breed in dark areas that are typically inaccessible to humans. They build their nests from found objects.

Thu 13 Nov 2014   What You Don’t Know About Rats & Mice Can Hurt You  Posted by sugarland under Pest Control   No Comments    If rodents can find a way into your house, they will be more than happy to become your newest houseguest. As the weather becomes colder, people’s homes provide the perfect place for rodents to find warmth and protection.   Unfortunately, it is not very difficult for rodents to get into your home and once they’re inside, the problems will start. Here are some facts about rats & mice you may not know, but will help you understand how to better guard against them.  10 Facts about Rats   Rats can enter your house through a hole or gap as small as half an inch.  A brown rat can breed anytime through the year if the conditions are right. A female rat can produce up to five litters per year and the average gestation period is 21 days.  Rats reach sexual maturity within five weeks and can start breeding immediately.  Brown rats can live in any location.  If a big portion of a rat colony is exterminated, those that remain will increase their reproductive rate and work quickly to restore the population to its previous levels.  Rats carry diseases like Weil’s disease, viral hemorrhagic fever, Q fever, rat bite fever and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.  The brown rat is an omnivore and will eat almost anything at all.  One female rat can produce up to 84 offspring in one year and an average of 20 young per female per year will survive to adulthood.  Female rats can breed within one or two days of giving birth.  The average lifespan of a rat is one year.   Facts about Mice   A female house mouse has an estrous cycle of 4-6 days long.  The gestational period for a litter of mice is approximately 19-21 days and females give birth to a litter of 3-14 babies.  One female mouse can have approximately 5-10 litters of young per year, so mice reproduce very quickly.  Mice can breed throughout the year.  Female mice reach sexual maturity within six weeks of birth and males around eight weeks. Both genders can breed as early as five weeks.  House mice can transmit diseases and contaminate food and food packages.  Mice are very adaptable and can live in nearly any type of environment.  A house mouse usually lives less than a year in the wild, but in a protected environment like a human house, they can live from two to three years.  A female mouse is ready to breed again within two to four days of giving birth.  The actual number of births a young mouse can have will depend on the quality and availability of food and size of the colony.   Controlling the Rodent Population  To be successful, rodents must have access to three simple things: food, water and shelter. However, combatting a rodent population is not so easy. Getting rid of them involves three different aspects: rodent proofing, sanitation and rodent killing.  Rodent proofing the home means using good sanitary practices like removing trash, and disposing of any junk or food sources that could be eaten by rats and mice. All the openings in the home where water pipes, vents and spouts enter the dwelling will need to be sealed off or filled in. Doors and windows should be secured tightly and any broken screens should be replaced.  Rodent proofing and sanitation are the things that require the most effort; in serious cases of infestation, it’s best to leave these things to the professionals.  For homeowners dealing with a rodent problem, there are traps and poisons available, but these will only offer so much relief. When dealing with a large rodent population, it pays to remember you may catch one or two in a trap, but how many others are still crawling around your home remains to be seen.  It’s a good idea to bring in a professional pest control company to check out the premises when dealing with rodents, because they can be extremely difficult to completely get rid of. If you experience any signs of rodents around your house, don’t hesitate to call the pest control professionals at Sugarland Exterminating .         « The Importance of Commercial Pest Control | Tips to Keep Rodents Out of Your Home This Winter »        No Responses		to “ What You Don’t Know About Rats & Mice Can Hurt You ”   Comments:      Leave a Reply     Name(required)     Mail (will not be published)(required)     Website   XHTML: You can use these tags: <a href="" title=""> <abbr title=""> <acronym title=""> <b> <blockquote cite=""> <cite> <code> <del datetime=""> <em> <i> <q cite=""> <s> <strike> <strong>                  CAPTCHA Code *                   Archived Entry   Post Date :  Thursday, Nov 13th, 2014 at 1:01 pm  Category :  Pest Control  Do More :  You can leave a response , or trackback from your own site.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious respiratory disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva. Humans can contract the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus.  HPS was first recognized in 1993 and has since been identified throughout the United States. Although rare, HPS is potentially deadly.  Who gets Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?  Anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry hantavirus is at risk of HPS. Rodent infestation in and around the home remains the primary risk for hantavirus exposure. Even healthy individuals are at risk for HPS infection if exposed to the virus.  How does the disease spread?  In the United States, Hantavirus infection is usually spread by inhaling the virus, which is in the droppings, urine and saliva of infected rodents. Although uncommon, the virus can also be passed to humans through a rodent bite.       The Deer Mouse is 3-4 inches long with a brown back and white stomach    In Southern Nevada the common deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) appears to be responsible for the spread of the disease at elevations above 5,000 feet. About 12 percent of the Deer mice that have been tested were found to be infected with the virus.  Other rodents including the cactus mouse, pinon mouse, brush mouse, canyon mouse, and western harvest mouse may also be infected with this virus but in much lower numbers.  The virus does not make rodents sick, but people who come into close contact with rodents may get sick. Even though not all rodents have the virus, it is difficult to properly identify mice; so all rodents should be avoided.  People may get sick when they touch or breathe dust from where there are rodent droppings (feces) or urine. Insect bites will not make you sick and you will not get HPS from another person.  What are the symptoms?  People who are sick from HPS may at first think they have the flu. The difference is that with this virus the breathing problems become worse, the lungs fill with fluid which may cause the breathing to stop and the person to die. The fatality rate is approximately 50 percent.  Early symptoms include:   Fatigue  Fever  Muscle aches (especially in the thighs, hips, back and sometimes the shoulders)   About half of HPS patients also experience the following  symptoms:   Nausea  Vomiting  Diarrhea  Abdominal pain  Headache  Dizziness  Chills   Late symptoms begin four to 10 days after initial phase of illness and include:   Coughing  Shortness of breath  Tightness around chest   Less common symptoms include:   Earache  Sore throat  Runny nose  Rash   How soon do symptoms appear?  The incubation period is not well known due to the small number of HPS cases. Based on limited information, it appears symptoms may develop between one and five weeks after exposure.  What is the treatment for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?  There is no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for HPS. Persons with severe breathing problems are often placed on oxygen and a ventilator. If a person has been around rodents and have symptoms of fever, deep muscle aches and severe shortness of breath they should see a doctor immediately.  What can be done to prevent infection from the virus?  Rodent control in and around the home remains the primary strategy for preventing hantavirus infection.  General Precautions   Reduce the availability of food sources and nesting sites used by rodents inside your home.  Keep food (including pet food) and water covered and stored in rodent-proof metal or thick plastic containers with tight-fitting lids.  Store garbage in rodent-proof metal or thick plastic containers with tight-fitting lids.  Wash dishes and cooking utensils immediately after use and remove all spilled food.  Dispose of trash and clutter.   Activities that should be avoided are:   Farming around rodent-infested areas  Using rodent-inhabited buildings  Cleaning barns or outbuildings infested with rodents  Disturbing rodent nests and burrows while hiking or camping   Prevent rodents from entering the home:   Use steel wool or cement to seal, screen, or otherwise cover all openings into the home that have a diameter of 1/4 inch or larger.  Place metal roof flashing as a rodent barrier around the base of wooden, earthen, or adobe dwellings up to a height of 12 inches and buried in the soil to a depth of 6 inches.  Place 3 inches of gravel under the base of homes or under mobile homes to discourage rodent burrowing.  Reduce rodent shelter and food sources within 100 feet of the home.  Use raised cement foundations in new construction of sheds, barns, outbuildings, or woodpiles.  When possible, place woodpiles 100 feet or more from the house and elevate wood at least 12 inches off the ground.  Store grains and animal feed in rodent-proof containers.  Near buildings, remove food sources that might attract rodents or store food and water in rodent-proof containers.  Store hay on pallets, and use traps or rodenticide continuously to keep hay free of rodents.  Do not leave pet food in feeding dishes.  Dispose of garbage and trash in rodent-proof containers that are elevated at least 12 inches off the ground.  Haul away trash, abandoned vehicles, discarded tires, and other items that may serve as rodent nesting sites.  Cut grass, brush, and dense shrubbery within 100 feet of the home.  Place spring-loaded traps at likely spots for rodent shelter within 100 feet around the home, and use continuously.   Clean-up Procedures   Any area where you see rodent activity such as dead rodents or rodent droppings (feces) and urine should be thoroughly cleaned.   Use wet mopping or wet cleaning methods to carefully remove rodent droppings (feces) and urine from occupied buildings.  Avoid creating dust or aerosol from rodent droppings (feces) and urine.    Wet with disinfectant before cleaning, and use wet mopping or cleaning techniques.  Do not use a vacuum cleaner or a broom because they will create airborne particles and dust.  Wear rubber gloves, long-sleeved clothing, and a dust mask.  Always wash hands with soap and warm water afterward.   Use 3 tablespoons of household chlorine bleach to a gallon of water as a disinfectant.  You may also use Lysol or other cleaners that say disinfectant on the label and have phenol on the list of ingredients.  Apply the disinfectant to the mouse droppings (feces) and urine and all areas where rodents have been at least 30 minutes before cleanup to give it a chance to work.  Dispose of droppings (feces) by burial in double plastic bags.  If droppings have been treated properly with a sanitizer, they can be double bagged and disposed in the regular trash bin.      Do not touch dead rodents.  Wet dead rodents and rodent nests with disinfectant, allowing at least 30 minutes for disinfectant to work before removing.  Dispose of rodent bodies by either picking them up with a tool and placing in a double plastic bag, which is then sealed or placing hand into a double plastic bag, picking up rodents, then reversing the bag back over the rodents and sealing.  Dispose of by burial or in the trash.  Wash gloved hands in a general household disinfectant and then in soap and water.  Wash bare hands after removing gloves.     Guidance for Hikers and Campers   Stay away from rodents and rodent burrows or dens such as pack rat nests.  Do not use cabins or other enclosed shelters that have rodents or rodent droppings (feces) and urine until they have been properly cleaned and disinfected.  Do not pitch tents or place sleeping bags near rodent droppings (feces) or burrows.  Also do not camp near places where rodents may find shelter such as garbage dumps or wood piles.  If possible, do not sleep on the bare ground.    Use a cot with the sleeping surface at least 12 inches above the ground.  Use tents with floors.    Keep food in rodent-proof containers.  Promptly bury  all garbage and trash, or discard in covered trash containers.  Use only bottled water or water that has been disinfected by filtration, boiling, chlorination or iodination for drinking, cooking, washing dishes, and brushing teeth.   Special Precautions  Homes of people infected with HPS or buildings with a great many rodents or a lot of rodent droppings (feces) need to be very carefully cleaned. You should contact your health department for specific instructions.

So, removing the verbal, and averaging the numerical ... If you see one mouse, chances are you have 33.076923076923 more.  As far as cockroaches are concerned, common wisdom is less specific, at least from a cursory glance at the results. posted by crunchland at 10:02 PM on November 10, 2004  I so want to know the answer to this question.  I have a big fat lazy cat and a kitchen full of mice, at least judging by the mouse shit I think it's  'full'.  I mean, how much can one mouse poop? On the poop based algorithim I have at least 3287 of them living in my house. The upside is, I got one today and the rest should be running scared (while the cat sleeps). posted by cedar at 11:18 PM on November 10, 2004  I saw one in my laundry room, set a half dozen traps, and spent the next two hours in the living room  listening to SNAP! SNAP! in the back of the house as the death toll mounted.  I wound up bagging about 15 over a few days.  Oddly, I set some traps in the basement under the laundry room, same bait (peanut butter), and so far something(s) have licked the peanut butter out of about a dozen traps without springing them. So, all the stupid/clumsy ones are apparently out of the gene pool, and I'm worried I'm creating a superrace of communicating, tool-using, PhD-having mice.  Anyway, my advice is plug up the mouse entry points before you go killing, because if they can get in, you'll be fighting a never-ending supply of reinforcements. Use steel wool pushed tightly into every little chink. posted by stupidsexyFlanders at 3:26 AM on November 11, 2004  Cedar's mouse is a deer mouse, not a house mouse. You can tell the difference because deer mice are white underneath and have big eyes and ears. Deer mice (and field mice or voles with very short tails) aren't really vermin, they're wildlife. They come into houses this time of year looking for somewhere nice to spend the winter. They won't breed in your house. You'll run into them if you live in a rural/exurban area (deer mice if you're near woods, field mice if near fields). The best way to control them is to seal off your house, which you probably want to do for energy saving purposes anyway. Plug all holes with that spray foam stuff.  House mice are the same color all over and have little beady eyes. They will breed like crazy and my experience is that one means at least several. Or billions.. posted by TimeFactor at 6:52 AM on November 11, 2004  my experience with mice has repeatedly been the same as crash's posted by jessamyn at 7:11 AM on November 11, 2004  So, I've been planning on posting an anti-mouse Q for a while... but this may do just as well.  I live in an urban (read: vermin infested) setting, where there are lots of mice.  Gross, shit-all-over-my-kitchen mice.  I've tried several different types of traps and have killed, so far, about 9 mice (the glue type trap that Cedar used being the most successful) and see one scurry by most nights.  My question is this: How do I eradicate the bastards?  My house is mid-(stalled)-remodel, so my kitchen isn't really "sealable" and I live in the inner-city so I'm sure there's a huge mice population, regardless of what I do.  Should I try poison? Do I just have to live with it? Mouse droppings are so gross. posted by maniactown at 8:45 AM on November 11, 2004  maniactown -- Get a young cat (1-2 y.o.).  The smell cats emit is a natural deterrent to mice, as are their claws.  I suggest a young cat as opposed to an older cat because, well, older cats can be really lazy. posted by Civil_Disobedient at 11:24 AM on November 11, 2004   « Older Firefox bookmarks issue   |   Can you help me make a video jukebox?

But to get rid of them, you need to understand what they do and what they like. Following are some of the most frequently asked questions -- and answers -- about mice.                                                               01  of 12            How Do I Know If I Have Mice?         Tom Mareschal/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images     Although the most obvious sign is that you have mice in your house , of course, seeing live or dead mice in your house . But there are plenty of other signs that can tell you that a mouse infestation may be building. These include: gnawed holes in stored foods, piled papers, insulation, etc. food scraps or wrappings left behind, especially in out of the way places (or in a shoe, which this author has actually seen occur!). excreted droppings - 1/4 - 1/8 inch with pointed end or ends. rodent hairs. runw ... MORE ays - narrow pathways where dust and dirt have been swept clean, grease marks are noticeable, or urine trails can be seen under black light. nests or piled nesting materials. skittering on hardwood or laminate floors the rank odor of a large infestation.              02  of 12            How Do I Know If It Is a Mouse or a Rat?             Rats are much larger than mice. Keven Law 2009     Mice are much smaller than rats . Mice are about 2 to 3 1/2 inches in length – plus another 3 to 4 inches of tail. The most common rats in the U.S. are the Norway rat and the roof rat. They will be about 14 to 16 inches in length, with tail length varying by species.              03  of 12            What Do Mice Eat?        Mice most prefer to eat cereal grains and plants, but they will feed on almost anything.              04  of 12            How Long Will a Mouse Live?        A house mouse will rarely live more than a year in the wild, but in a protected environment with food and water (like a house!), it can live up to three years.       Continue to 5 of 12 below.                  05  of 12            Why Do I Keep Finding Shredded Paper and Black Rice-Like Things?             House mouse in its nest. Liz Bomford/Photodisc/Getty Images     It is very likely that you have found a mouse nest. A mouse will build its nest from about any soft material or finely shredded paper. And the little black "rice" is most likely mouse droppings.              06  of 12            Where Should I Put Mouse Traps?        Traps should be placed where the mice are. If you have found any signs of mice – shredded paper or cloth, droppings, urine stains, gnawed items – place the traps in those areas. Traps are available from home and garden stores or even some grocery stores. Many can be reused, while others are intended to hide the trapped mouse from view and be used only once.              07  of 12            I Know I Have Mice, but My Traps Aren't Catching Them!        Mice are very curious and will investigate new things. So, if mice are not caught within the first days of trap placement, the trap is probably in the wrong place and should be moved. Place the trap where any signs of mice are seen, or where food or water is available.              08  of 12            What Is the Best Bait for Mouse Traps?             Contrary to popular belief, cheese is not the best bait for traps. Michael Cogliantry/The Image Bank/Getty Images     Contrary to popular belief, cheese is not the best bait to use in traps. Peanut butter can be very attractive to mice, but it needs to be replaced if it gets too dry or hard. Other good options are bacon, nuts, dried food, and sticky candies. The bait should be securely attached to the trap trigger so the rodent can't simply pluck it off and walk away.       Continue to 9 of 12 below.                  09  of 12            I Think I Have Mice, but I Never See Any. Why?        Mice are nocturnal creatures, so they are most active from dusk up 'til morning light. They don't usually like bright lights, but a mouse may sometimes be seen during the day, especially if its nest has been disturbed, it is seeking food, or there is a large infestation.              10  of 12            Why Are One or Two Mice a Problem?        In a single year, one female mouse can breed up to 10 litters of 5 to 6 young. These 60 offspring can begin to reproduce themselves in as little as six weeks. So within months, you could have a huge population of mice.              11  of 12            How Do Mice Get in My House?        A mouse can slip through holes and gaps as small as 1/4 inch - much smaller than appears possible. And if it's not big enough to squeeze through, the mouse can gnaw it until it is big enough. Mice also can jump 13 inches high and can run along wires, cables, and ropes. Because they are excellent jumpers, swimmers, and climbers, mice can climb even rough, vertical surfaces.              12  of 12            What Can I Do to Get Rid of Mice in My Home?             Eliminate mice by placing traps or bait where they are known to travel.     There are a number of methods of control, including traps, baits, rodenticides , and professional control .

After a little research, I decided to get the classic spring-style mouse traps. I set them with some peanut butter and after a night or two, I woke up to a dead mouse. After that, I cleaned up and set traps again. Things were quiet for a few days but then we got another hit.  A second dead mouse captured.  We were happy up until this point because we figured it was just one mouse but since we got the second one, I had to ask myself "when do I stop setting traps?" and "did the mouse come in because it smelled the peanut butter set trap?". It's sort of a catch 22 now. I am afraid that the mouse got in "because" I had peanut butter out (as part of the set trap).  I'm afraid that if I keep setting traps that I may just be inviting these little guys in.

I'd set traps until you go a few days without catching anything, then stop, but ask the dog to tell you if anyone is mooching his food :-) – Jason  Jun 27 '12 at 22:43            @Jason - Thanks for the comment. I should have mentioned that I stopped leaving food out over night for the dog so that shouldn't be a source any longer. – Brian  Jun 27 '12 at 22:45        4      There is never just one mouse. ;) – DA01  Jun 28 '12 at 5:16        1      At least it sounds like your traps are in an accessible area. I had mice in my attic for the longest time. I'd set the traps out for a few days and catch 2-3 mice. Fast forward a couple weeks later, and there would be scurrying sounds coming from the attic again. Eventually I ended up forgetting I had put the traps in the attic. Three weeks later, I found the maggot-filled corpse of a very unlucky mouse in a trap I had forgotten to check. – Doresoom  Jun 28 '12 at 21:36            I've heard from a pest control expert that they start in your attic, travel down through the basement then meet u in the middle in the living space...& that's when u know u have an infestation! – user7541  Sep 24 '12 at 22:40        |  show 1 more comment          4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  12  down vote  accepted      Setting traps will kill what you have, but you still have the problem of the mice getting in. you need to figure out how they are getting into the house. Mice can get through incredibly tiny holes, so it might be a chore to find them all. But as you find holes, seal them up. Steel wool is useful for this as they don't like chewing through it.     share | improve this answer     answered Jun 28 '12 at 5:17       DA01   20.7k 15 50 109              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      I personally go with 'forever'. I've got a good-size house, on a little bit land, and a garage door that I leave open for fair amounts of time each day in good weather. I'm ALWAYS going to have mice getting in, even though I've patched every hole I can find. It's just sort of inevitable at this point. So I keep the snap-traps under the sink and in the basement. I check them every couple of weeks, change the bait (I like cheese) now and then, and I get a few mice every year.  But no major infestations, and they don't seem to get past my initial trap points, so I don't get them in the pantry or anything.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 25 '12 at 1:14       Michael Kohne   2,711 3 16 26              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      According to the CDC's website, keep putting out the mouse traps and after five straight days of no mice, you should be in the clear.  I did that in our attic and it seemed to do the trick --- and yes, there is always more than one... we caught 5 in 5 days.  Three traps were left with peanut butter and no catches.  After 30 days, I put out two traps again just to make sure and after five days there were no more catches.  I recommend the 5 day rule.  Oh, and my recommendation with the snap traps.  You don't have to touch the trap/mice if you put the trap in a small box (shoe size or smaller) before putting it in your basement/attic.     share | improve this answer      edited Sep 30 '16 at 20:02             answered Sep 30 '16 at 19:52       Mary C   21 2                  Putting the trap in a box, with appropriate baffle and some weight on top of it, is also one way to cat-proof mousetraps. – keshlam  Oct 3 '16 at 0:34        1      Can you provide a link to the CDC website where you found that information? – mmathis  Oct 24 '16 at 22:05        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      For what it's worth, I decided to contract with a pest control company for ongoing service. Periodically they refill the bait containers in the basement, and this has been sufficient to keep any mice from nesting in the attic. I don't like bait a lot -- among other things I worry about a poisoned-but-not-dead-yet mouse being found by a cat -- but it has been effective.  Reportedly, old style snap-the-neck traps are actually the least painful killing trap, but of course those have to be more actively maintained. Nonkilling traps are a nice idea but you have to empty them somewhere before the mice starve; I think what I really want is a nonkilling trap that sends email when it has caught something.  Warning: Mice often carry ticks, and in some areas ticks can carry  things like Lyme disease. Be careful when disposing of carcasses. I've been tempted to put out Daminix as well, though it isn't cheap.     share | improve this answer      edited Sep 30 '16 at 22:00             answered Aug 23 '16 at 0:58       keshlam   14.7k 2 25 52              add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Fear of house mice is actually a very appropriate reaction, though, because they often carry disease. Contact with the urine, droppings or saliva of infected mice; mouse-contaminated food;or bites from the fleas they carry can spread serious illness such as salmonellosis, listeria, hantavirus and even the bubonic plague . Therefore it is wise to keep mice out of your home if at all possible and to get rid of them ASAP when they do happen to make their way inside. When Do Mice Infest Human Residences? Contrary to its name, the house mouse tends to live in fields or forests. However, these rodents invade 21 million American homes annually when the weather gets cold or their food supply is disturbed, especially in the case of exceptionally severe weather conditions. One side effect of 2012’s devastating Hurricane Sandy was large numbers of displaced mice, which sought food and shelter inside human dwellings in New York and New Jersey. Newark rodent control was a serious concern. Stacks of firewood, compost heaps and untrimmed grass or bushes adjacent to your house are the perfect hiding place for mice, and from there it’s only a hop, skip and a jump inside. Set up woodpiles and compost heaps away from your home (minimum 20 feet) and keep all foliage well groomed. Do not allow debris to pile up near your home. What Are the Signs of Infestation? If your home does become infested, unless you are in total denial, chances are it won’t take long to find out. Mice leave plenty of evidence of their presence, including shredded paper, gnawed wires, the smell of urine and droppings which resemble pointed black grains of rice. (BTW, the average mouse can scatter as many as 80 droppings throughout your home every day – yuck!) Even if you don’t actually come across a mouse nest, you are very likely to hear rustling and squeaking in the walls, particularly at night. When you are harboring a sizable rodent population, you may even encounter a bold mouse out exploring your living room. What Do Mice Eat? Surprisingly, cheese is not their favorite food. Mice love grain, cereals and baked goods such as bread and crackers. They also have a fondness for chocolate. If you are baiting traps , strong-smelling foods such as bacon or peanut butter are generally recommended. Because mice are capable of chewing through materials ranging from paper to plastic, it is best to store any foods with mouse appeal in glass or metal containers – or in the fridge. Is it Possible to Have Just One Mouse in My Home? Although you might wish it were otherwise, you will almost never find “only one mouse” in a home.  Females mature at the age of 2 months and produce approximately 8 litters of a dozen pups , as their young are called, per year. That’s about 100 in total! What Are Some Unsuccessful Mouse Control Methods? Housecats are not an effective means of mouse control. In fact, mice often are attracted to leftover food in or around your pet’s dish. (They also enjoy spilled birdseed and dry dog food.) Glue traps are another inadvisable method of dealing with a mouse infestation. While at first glance they may seem more humane than snap traps, you are left with the problem of handling a flimsy contraption stuck tight to a terrified, angry rodent which is very much alive. Please don’t ask me how I know. What Does Work? Poisoned bait, snap traps and “catch and release” traps (one of which is even approved by PETA ) are successful methods of getting rid of house mice. If you set out poisoned bait, be sure to place it next to the wall or other edge, where mice like to travel, and keep it out of reach of children and pets. To prevent further problems, stop mice from getting back inside. Cover exterior vents with metal screening and seal up other potential mouse entry points – for example, cracks in your foundation and gaps under exterior doors.

Justanotherone wrote: I live in ny state. it's cold and snowy and most houses are bound to get mice in them in the winter. I have been bad lately and keeping the kitchen clean, it's not filthy just cluttered with a few crumbs here or there. every time I clean the kitchen I find a few droppings, about 4 or 5, 2-3 in two separate spots on the counter. I clean the kitchen lately maybe once every two weeks. for the first time, I actually found bread thst had been chewed through. now let me ask, how can I tell if it's just one mouse or a dozen? when our kitchen is clutter free for a week, I usually don't see any droppings. it takes a week and a half before I see droppings after I've cleaned. I'm not trying to sound naive but that few droppings in such a long time, I'm guessing there's maybe one or two and that's it. I'm also trying to figure how to get rid of then since I know the place they're hiding I can't get to (und er the counters). any idea how to tell if it's a sole mouse or a few? and how to grt rid of then when you have 2 dogs and a toddler in the house, and a mommy who's allergic to cats (me) ??? I'm just trying to figure what to do, my fiance is not concerned at all, but I'm thinking about that hauntavirus that they carry... Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  57 Posts A  AllyM24 @Justanotherone  Set traps w  wouch I think the only way you can tell is by trapping it/them. If you only catch one and the droppings stop, then it might be just one.  That would be very unlikely though. j  jennnayyy @Justanotherone  I would set traps. They make some where you can catch the mice alive and just let them go in a park away from your home. It's less messy and you don't have to deal with icky mice in your kitchen. d  danisteph @Justanotherone  We got a few in our basement last winter due to a small hole where a pipe running into the house sank into the ground. Pest guy said they can't take a few steps without leaving several droplets. They breed and multiply pretty fast. When you set out traps wear rubber gloves. Never touch the traps because if your scent is on them they won't go anywhere near them. That's all I remember, good luck! j  jtyme921 You clean your kitchen once every 2 weeks? Gross n  nanismama @Justanotherone  My mom would always say that one mouse is the equivalent of many mice. You might want to get some traps or call someone to come inspect for rodents. You should also clean your kitchen more often. That's the one place I clean once a day if not twice. Rodents carry so many diseases...would not want them around our food! S  Sibby33 @Justanotherone  They say were there's one there's more. What kind of dogs do you have that they don't hunt the mice? You should probably set traps. Maybe clean out all of your cabinets and use a flashlight to find any areas where mice can get in or you could take everything out and line your cabinets with hard aluminum. Nice won't chew threw it. n  nanismama @Justanotherone  I just re-read your post and you mention you have pets and a toddler...we had a horrendous rat infestation in our attic (had to get all new insulation, major cleaning and trapping - yuck!) Anyway, we contacted the local public health Vector Control - not sure if it's called the same in NY but they placed child/pet proof traps in our yard. So I know that there are options out there besides the little snap ones! j  jtyme921 @Sibby33  My lab/pit mix is scared of mice. And frogs. And her shadow. My min pun used to catch them in the alley behind the house and try to bring them to us as gifts. He was so quick, they didn't stand a chance. S  Sibby33 @jtyme921  Your dog made me giggle! Lol we had a cat like that. I'd see about the traps that are safe for babes and toddlers. To bad your pups aren't more of assistances! s  shesafullonmonet For every one that you see, there are seven more you don't see, I would get on that quick before you're dealing with an infestation K  Kaeluminati @Justanotherone  Where there's one, there's more unfortunately. Set some traps. I've used the ones that there's a trap door so they can't get back out and you don't have to see it yuck. Bait them with peanut butter. And clean your damn kitchen!! You have a kid and pets, cleanliness should be of the utmost importance. Make sure all food is sealed tight, no spills or crumbs, floors should be swept/mopped etc. put your bread in the fridge or airtight container so mice can't get it. Make a habit of cleaning after dinner. M  Mrs.H2U @Justanotherone  We got them when we moved Into a house surrounded by woods. There are always more than one. I got on amazon and for about $30 got a plug in mice/spider/bug thingy. I don't remember what it's called but you plug it in (put it on animal safe for the dogs ears) and it send electrical pulses throughout the house. Never had another problem with the mice or spiders. And since it chases everything out you don't have to clean up dead mice. A  Angelah2016 @Justanotherone  Why did I have to read this post? I have a mouse phobia. Even reading this gave me chills down my spine! V  VikiOct2014 @Justanotherone  You need to clean more often. Especially with a baby and pets. The last thing you need is a mouse biting your baby. I suggest you get someone to deep clean the kitchen and the rest of the house. Then set sticky traps on the floor and close the door overnight. f  ftm_gen @Justanotherone  Having dealt with quite a serious mouse problem when I used to rent, my advice is call in the professionals immediately, before things get worse. They'll multiply faster than you can trap them. And with a little one in the house who is probably still in the getting into everywhere and touching everything phase, I mean those things spread all kinds of bacteria. An exterminator may be able to tell you where they're coming from also, so you can patch up the access(es). And finally, while a couple of dishes in the sink is not the end of the world, always pick up food messes right away and store food on your counter in containers or a bread box. T  TormundLives In my experience, seeing one mouse almost always means there are more.  It is similar to brown recluses and ants.  There is hardly ever just one brown recluse or one ant lurking around.   You can get a better feel for how many there are by setting traps.  If you catch multiple mice or a different one every night, then you have your answer.  If you have multiple mice, the easiest way to get rid of them is to call an exterminator, but that can be expensive.  You can always catch and release them, but that is time consuming and they often come back. My brother and SIL once had a nest of mice in the crawl space under their house.  They eventually had to fill in the crawl space to get rid of them.  They can be a real nuisance. s  samcro21 we live in the country surrounded by woods so we have had mice. my husband used spray foam around the hole for my dishwasher they were getting in and we haven't seen one since. my best advice is alternating trap types. if we used a wood snap trap and stopped catching mice, I switched to a house trap, or a plastic snap trap, or a glue trap. in my experience it keeps it so they don't get used to seeing it and know what it is. C  CoffeeMakinTitties 1. Clean your kitchen a lot more often especially with mouse droppings around, ew! 2. Set traps out regularly. 3. Look for holes and places where they are coming in and plug them. 4. Problem solved. Surprising what a little common sense and proactive approach can achieve.

Everything I've read since leads me to believe that if you have one mouse then you have a houseful. Since then I've left the traps and poison down just in case, but no sign of anything. So I was just wondering, am I kidding myself that this was just a Lone Ranger or am I likely to find more?       Add message | Report    mineofuselessinformation   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:11:22    Leave the traps down for two weeks. If you haven't caught any more then, it was probably the only one. (I used to live in a house backing on to fields and had a pretty awful summer when I caught upwards of twelve!)       Add message | Report    SloanePeterson   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:11:52    We had one mouse last Christmas. I was convinced I was going mad as I was having a very stressful time and kept seeing something dashing along the walls out of the corner of my eye. Seriously convinced I was going nuts, and sow as dh who none the less agreed to put some mouse traps down. The next day I heard it snap and found a fat little mouse caught in it. I went into serious de-mouse the house mode and cleaned EVERYTHING, I found it had climbed into a drawer downstairs and chewed a pencil and a tiny chocolate to shreds. I put traps absolutely everywhere, baited with chocolate and haven't caught another since. No more dropping either, which I discovered along the skirting boards, hidden by our hideous carpet until I knew to look for them. I've kept some traps set up, and dotted cotton wool balls doused in peppermint oil in the corners of rooms, which apparently they hate. Also used some expander foam far too liberally on any gaps. I actually think our mouse came in in our Christmas tree box, rather than make its way into the house as we bought it from a local large charity shop that kept the trees undercover but outside. So in out case, yes it was just one mouse. I am seriously dreading winter though as it really did affect me finding that bloody mouse and dread it happening again. I couldn't relax.       Add message | Report    Noodlesoup1976   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:22:48    Thank you. I've literally had the house upside down and inside out and can't find any signs of mouse droppings or gnawing, it was just in the one corner of my bedroom where I caught it.

I'll lay traps and once I've caught it/them I see no signs of mice for ages after. You can tell when you have mice. The houseful thing is a myth.

Add message | Report    shabbs   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:35:41    About five years ago we were going on holiday to Rhodes. We overslept slightly and the taxi was early....cue running around and out of the door. When we came home two weeks later, I quickly noticed that some of my kitchen flooring had been chewed and one of my brand new trainers had been half eaten??? The next night I walked into my kitchen and saw what I first thought was a mouse.....it ran down the side of the cooker and I watched horrified at the verrrrry long tail....yep it was a rat....<<shudder>> we live in a row of terraced house that all share cavity walls and the rat, rats, millions of rats, were having a ball going in and out of everyones kitchen!!!! The next night I did the same (fuelled on Ouzo) walked into the kitchen and saw the tail!!! I decided, with the aid of the Ouzo that I was going to kill it lol.......could see it down the side of the washing machine....it ran out and I grabbed the first thing to hand - fly/wasp spray lol. I tried spraying it on the rat which then jumped about a foot in the air - which, in my drunken state, I tried to kick it!!!!! Next day we got the 'council rat catcher' in and he was more than slightly amused at my ouzo/fly spray incident. It took about a month before all the houses were rat free. Incidentally when they have eaten poison and have died it smells like garlic and onions. Im sure mice are not as bad as rats <<itches, stands on a chair and gets the fly spray out>>       Add message | Report    Noodlesoup1976   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:47:15    Haha Shabbs I actually used to have 2 pet rats, they were lovely boys. This was definitely a teeny tiny mouse, bloody sodding scary though       Add message | Report    CointreauVersial   Sat 17-Sep-16 23:52:05    Sometimes there IS just one mouse, particularly if you're rural. We had one downstairs a couple of years ago - it made a right racket every evening, in and out of the kitchen bins and racing across the living room. Eventually I caught it in a humane trap, and let it go a few streets away by the posh houses Never heard another sound, so it was clearly a lone wolf mouse.       Add message | Report    Thatsmeinthecorner2016   Sun 18-Sep-16 00:15:38    A mouse is normally never alone. I know it's not a consolation but it's a fact. Despite the presence of fields behind us, no mouse in our house really wants to be there. They're all toys brought in by the chubby monster currently sleeping at the end of my bed or the little street thug currently spreading mayhem amongst the local rodents. But before them, in the previous house we had mice and they were definitely a big family as we were catching them one by one. That said, I love pet rats and used to have pet mice but I prefer the grey variety dead.       Add message | Report    Arfarfanarf   Sun 18-Sep-16 00:32:22    Do you have a cat?

He didn't. The pest control people laid traps in the loft and caught dozens over a period of several months. Apparently they must have been scrambling up a climber against NDN's house wall and getting in via a hole under the eaves and into the neighbour's loft. From there they were working their way into his loft as well.       Add message | Report    CrepeDeChineWag   Sun 18-Sep-16 01:13:51    YABU This is not a Highlander situation.       Add message | Report    WiddlinDiddlin   Sun 18-Sep-16 03:17:38    One mouce = lots of mice. Mice really don't come in ones. Make sure the traps and bait trays are in the right places, rodents really don't like new objects and they don't like to come off their paths and trails (one reason they almost constantly dribble wee is that it leaves a scent trail for others to follow). So the fact you haven't caught any or bait hasn't been disturbed does not automatically mean you only had the one mouse - it could mean you put them in the wrong places or that they are still too new for the mice to investigate, or that they don't NEED to bother because they have enough food thanks very much..

Add message | Report    WhateverWillBe   Sun 18-Sep-16 08:22:11    I think it depends on where they come from. I regularly have a lone mouse (or rat, once)...about once every 3 months or so. But I know that's because DCat has a penchant for catching them, bringing them in and releasing them. We put traps dow,n, catch it really quickly and then hear nothing for the next few months until he does it again.      Add message | Report    AnUtterIdiot   Sun 18-Sep-16 09:45:56    If you live in town and have no pets, it is unlikely that you only have one mouse. If you live more rurally and/or you have dogs or cats, you might just have the one you've seen. They're quite savvy around traps. My town mice licked the peanut butter off my traps without ever getting caught. In the end we existed in a state of armed neutrality as the landlord refused to do anything about it ("all Victorian houses have mice").

Here’s what you need to know about them and how to get rid of them. They can make you very sick  Story continues below             Related       What you need to know about home insulation         What you need to know about LED bulbs         What you need to know about furnace filters         Make your home safer with these 5 tips         Hantavirus case confirmed in central Alberta           While the common house mouse is not as dangerous to your health as a deer mouse, they can still spread disease, such as hantavirus , salmonellosis and listeria through their urine, droppings, saliva and nesting materials. These diseases can be deadly, and if you have a major infestation in your home the risk factor of catching one increases. They multiply fast No home ever has just one mouse and don’t be fooled into thinking otherwise. Mice can breed year-round with one female able to produce five to 10 litters per year. With an average of six to eight babies per litter, a family of six mice can multiply into 60 over the course of three months. They can destroy your home It might sound overly dramatic saying a mouse can burn your house down, but the bottom-line is they can . Mice love chewing on wires and when they are in your walls and attic — with full access to your household electrical wiring — you better believe they are nibbling away. They do this to keep their teeth short as well as to gain access to places the wires may be blocking (such as the hole a wire runs through). Once a wire becomes bare the chance of it sparking a fire increases. According to the Illinois Dept. of Public Health , 25 per cent of all fires attributed to “unknown causes” in the U.S. are most likely started by rodents. Mice can also chew through soft concrete, wood (structure and furniture), drywall, rubber, plastic pipes, insulation , aluminum, and even gas lines . They will always find a way inside Mice can fit through spaces much smaller than they appear (think the size of a dime). Holes and cracks in your foundation and outer walls are prime entry points, as are doorways and areas around windows, chimneys, roof vents and wherever pipes and wires enter your home. They can also jump, climb and swim , making it nearly impossible to prevent them from getting inside. They will eat anything As mentioned above, mice will chew and eat through anything. They especially love grains and can make their way through a box of cereal or crackers without much effort. They also eat between 15 and 20 times a day and will make their nest near a food source (think your kitchen or pantry). The health department for the Region of Durham, Ont., says mice contaminate about 10 times more food than they eat . Eating food that a mouse has contaminated is a surefire way of contracting a disease from them.

Cleaning up after mice Because of the risk of disease associated with mice, cleaning up their nesting or spots they have defecated and urinated on is a process that should not be taken lightly. Vacuuming and sweeping mouse droppings is a big no-no as it can release more bacteria into the air and the dust can make you very ill. Always wear a mask and latex or vinyl gloves while cleaning up mouse-infected spots. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends spraying the area with a commercial disinfectant or mixture of bleach and water and letting it sit for five minutes before using paper towels to wipe the area clean. Once you are done, put the dirty paper towels into a plastic bag and place them in your outside garbage. You should then clean and disinfect the entire area. Food items that have been chewed through should be immediately thrown into your outside garbage. For more on the proper way to clean up after mice, visit the CDC’s website at cdc.gov . How to get rid of mice Once you detect you have mice it’s best to deal with them right away so the chance of damage and disease spreading become less of a concern. The most common DIY methods of ridding your home of mice are snap traps and poison pellets or bait stations . Traps should be set and placed in areas around your home where you have detected mice. For best results, forget the cheese and use a piece of cracker with peanut butter in the trap. Check the traps daily and wear a pair of vinyl or latex gloves to release any dead mice trapped. Dead mice should be put in a plastic bag and placed in the outside garbage immediately. NOTE: If you have children in the house place the traps in areas they cannot get to. Poison pellets and bait stations can be placed inside kitchen and bathroom cabinets, attics, basements, and anywhere else you have detected mice. Most poison pellets and bait stations for mice are safe for household pets and children but use caution and follow the directions on the package. Ultrasonic sound devices, such as the PestChaser line from Victor , use an electronic tone that creates “intensely stressful conditions for rodents” in turn forcing them away from your home. These come in different sizes depending on whether you want a single room or an entire floor of a house or apartment covered. The sound that is emitted can only be heard by rodents and won’t bother you or your pets. WATCH: Rodent Prevention Using UltraSonic Repellents If you have a big infestation or find traps and poison are not working fast enough, call a pest control company to come in. Prevention Prevention is key to stopping mice from continuing to get inside your home. Checking the perimeter of your home and sealing any holes or cracks, as well as clearing away any piles of wood, leaves or other debris near your foundation walls, will make it more difficult for them to gain entry. Caulk around doors, windows and wherever wires and pipes enter. Check your roof and roof vents for damage or holes and fix as needed. Keeping your gutters clean is also helpful. Inside your home, store your dry goods (including cat and dog food) in hard plastic or glass containers with a tightly sealed lid. This will ensure your food does not get contaminated and help cut down on the risk of contracting a disease. Take garbage out frequently and don’t leave open food out on your counters as this can also attract mice. SOUND OFF: Do you have any tips on getting rid of or preventing mice from entering your home?

Discussion in ' After Hours Lounge (Off Topic) ' started by Bob McLaughlin , Jul 27, 2005 .            1    Jul 27, 2005                Bob McLaughlin  Screenwriter      Joined:  Aug 14, 2000    Messages:  1,129    Likes Received:  3    Trophy Points:  110    Real Name:  Bob          I have 3 cats who only unite when they are killing or eating something. The other day I walked down into my basement theater and saw all three cats staring under my theater seat risers. I thought they chased a spider under there, so I got a yardstick and pushed it under there. Next thing I know, a mouse pops out. I grabbed it with a towel and threw it outside.  My wife says there's no such thing as one lone mouse but I really think this is a freak occurrence. We have three very aggressive cats so I think a mouse would be crazy to take up residence in our house. The only reason I think this one came inside at all was because we had left the cat food out for several days while we were on a 3-day weekend vacation. Right before we left, my wife dished them up some canned cat food that we never usually serve them, as a treat. Ironically I think it was the catfood that attracted the mouse. We usually only put out their food for a few minutes at a time.  I've checked for any obvious holes or nests in the house but to no avail. I've heard that a mouse can squeeze through a hole the size of a dime. I believe it, that sucker was tiny! But I haven't heard any mouse noises and the cats aren't acting weird, so I think this was an anomaly. Anyone out there have any mouse stories they'd like to share? Is there such thing as getting just one mouse?

All three times they were "loners."            4    Jul 27, 2005                Dave Poehlman  Producer      Joined:  Mar 8, 2000    Messages:  3,813    Likes Received:  0    Trophy Points:  0          I also had a mouse in my last house who worked alone.  He had built a nest in my kitchen cabinet tucked way up under the counter. A great spot, really. Dark, quiet, warm from the dishwasher. It was all packed with Kleenex, dryer lint, and bits of yarn from some of the cat toys.  We caught him with a mouse-friendly trap and drove him to a far-off field.  Usually it's in the fall when mice are looking to move someplace warm and indoors. A lot of times they'll make their way through a dryer vent or a hole in a window screen.  Keep an eye out... since you didn't take him far away.. he may come back.            5    Jul 27, 2005                Inspector Hammer!

Though the saying "If there's one, there's usually more" is true in a lot of cases. I know there's mice in my house, though I don't usually see them unless I see my cats playing with one or find a dead one that they left as a present on the floor or in the tub.

Consequently, they may cause severe damage to crops and domestic gardens. Although it is commonly believed that mice are attracted to cheese, they tend to prefer foods that are higher in carbohydrates. Chocolate may be more effective attractant for mice than cheese. However, house mice are indiscriminate and will consume any food source available to them. They commonly disturb trashcans in search of food and are capable of surviving for long periods with very little food.  In times of starvation, mice have even been known to exhibit cannibalistic behavior. Females may consume their offspring, and some mice may consume their own tails. However, this behavior is generally only exhibited when under duress.  Mice may also gnaw on other, seemingly inedible materials. Electrical wiring, cardboard boxes, paper and other household items may exhibit chew marks. However, this destruction is caused as a result of the mouse’s nesting habits. Mice live and breed in dark areas that are typically inaccessible to humans. They build their nests from found objects.

Thu 13 Nov 2014   What You Don’t Know About Rats & Mice Can Hurt You  Posted by sugarland under Pest Control   No Comments    If rodents can find a way into your house, they will be more than happy to become your newest houseguest. As the weather becomes colder, people’s homes provide the perfect place for rodents to find warmth and protection.   Unfortunately, it is not very difficult for rodents to get into your home and once they’re inside, the problems will start. Here are some facts about rats & mice you may not know, but will help you understand how to better guard against them.  10 Facts about Rats   Rats can enter your house through a hole or gap as small as half an inch.  A brown rat can breed anytime through the year if the conditions are right. A female rat can produce up to five litters per year and the average gestation period is 21 days.  Rats reach sexual maturity within five weeks and can start breeding immediately.  Brown rats can live in any location.  If a big portion of a rat colony is exterminated, those that remain will increase their reproductive rate and work quickly to restore the population to its previous levels.  Rats carry diseases like Weil’s disease, viral hemorrhagic fever, Q fever, rat bite fever and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.  The brown rat is an omnivore and will eat almost anything at all.  One female rat can produce up to 84 offspring in one year and an average of 20 young per female per year will survive to adulthood.  Female rats can breed within one or two days of giving birth.  The average lifespan of a rat is one year.   Facts about Mice   A female house mouse has an estrous cycle of 4-6 days long.  The gestational period for a litter of mice is approximately 19-21 days and females give birth to a litter of 3-14 babies.  One female mouse can have approximately 5-10 litters of young per year, so mice reproduce very quickly.  Mice can breed throughout the year.  Female mice reach sexual maturity within six weeks of birth and males around eight weeks. Both genders can breed as early as five weeks.  House mice can transmit diseases and contaminate food and food packages.  Mice are very adaptable and can live in nearly any type of environment.  A house mouse usually lives less than a year in the wild, but in a protected environment like a human house, they can live from two to three years.  A female mouse is ready to breed again within two to four days of giving birth.  The actual number of births a young mouse can have will depend on the quality and availability of food and size of the colony.   Controlling the Rodent Population  To be successful, rodents must have access to three simple things: food, water and shelter. However, combatting a rodent population is not so easy. Getting rid of them involves three different aspects: rodent proofing, sanitation and rodent killing.  Rodent proofing the home means using good sanitary practices like removing trash, and disposing of any junk or food sources that could be eaten by rats and mice. All the openings in the home where water pipes, vents and spouts enter the dwelling will need to be sealed off or filled in. Doors and windows should be secured tightly and any broken screens should be replaced.  Rodent proofing and sanitation are the things that require the most effort; in serious cases of infestation, it’s best to leave these things to the professionals.  For homeowners dealing with a rodent problem, there are traps and poisons available, but these will only offer so much relief. When dealing with a large rodent population, it pays to remember you may catch one or two in a trap, but how many others are still crawling around your home remains to be seen.  It’s a good idea to bring in a professional pest control company to check out the premises when dealing with rodents, because they can be extremely difficult to completely get rid of. If you experience any signs of rodents around your house, don’t hesitate to call the pest control professionals at Sugarland Exterminating .         « The Importance of Commercial Pest Control | Tips to Keep Rodents Out of Your Home This Winter »        No Responses		to “ What You Don’t Know About Rats & Mice Can Hurt You ”   Comments:      Leave a Reply     Name(required)     Mail (will not be published)(required)     Website   XHTML: You can use these tags: <a href="" title=""> <abbr title=""> <acronym title=""> <b> <blockquote cite=""> <cite> <code> <del datetime=""> <em> <i> <q cite=""> <s> <strike> <strong>                  CAPTCHA Code *                   Archived Entry   Post Date :  Thursday, Nov 13th, 2014 at 1:01 pm  Category :  Pest Control  Do More :  You can leave a response , or trackback from your own site.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious respiratory disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva. Humans can contract the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus.  HPS was first recognized in 1993 and has since been identified throughout the United States. Although rare, HPS is potentially deadly.  Who gets Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?  Anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry hantavirus is at risk of HPS. Rodent infestation in and around the home remains the primary risk for hantavirus exposure. Even healthy individuals are at risk for HPS infection if exposed to the virus.  How does the disease spread?  In the United States, Hantavirus infection is usually spread by inhaling the virus, which is in the droppings, urine and saliva of infected rodents. Although uncommon, the virus can also be passed to humans through a rodent bite.       The Deer Mouse is 3-4 inches long with a brown back and white stomach    In Southern Nevada the common deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) appears to be responsible for the spread of the disease at elevations above 5,000 feet. About 12 percent of the Deer mice that have been tested were found to be infected with the virus.  Other rodents including the cactus mouse, pinon mouse, brush mouse, canyon mouse, and western harvest mouse may also be infected with this virus but in much lower numbers.  The virus does not make rodents sick, but people who come into close contact with rodents may get sick. Even though not all rodents have the virus, it is difficult to properly identify mice; so all rodents should be avoided.  People may get sick when they touch or breathe dust from where there are rodent droppings (feces) or urine. Insect bites will not make you sick and you will not get HPS from another person.  What are the symptoms?  People who are sick from HPS may at first think they have the flu. The difference is that with this virus the breathing problems become worse, the lungs fill with fluid which may cause the breathing to stop and the person to die. The fatality rate is approximately 50 percent.  Early symptoms include:   Fatigue  Fever  Muscle aches (especially in the thighs, hips, back and sometimes the shoulders)   About half of HPS patients also experience the following  symptoms:   Nausea  Vomiting  Diarrhea  Abdominal pain  Headache  Dizziness  Chills   Late symptoms begin four to 10 days after initial phase of illness and include:   Coughing  Shortness of breath  Tightness around chest   Less common symptoms include:   Earache  Sore throat  Runny nose  Rash   How soon do symptoms appear?  The incubation period is not well known due to the small number of HPS cases. Based on limited information, it appears symptoms may develop between one and five weeks after exposure.  What is the treatment for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome?  There is no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for HPS. Persons with severe breathing problems are often placed on oxygen and a ventilator. If a person has been around rodents and have symptoms of fever, deep muscle aches and severe shortness of breath they should see a doctor immediately.  What can be done to prevent infection from the virus?  Rodent control in and around the home remains the primary strategy for preventing hantavirus infection.  General Precautions   Reduce the availability of food sources and nesting sites used by rodents inside your home.  Keep food (including pet food) and water covered and stored in rodent-proof metal or thick plastic containers with tight-fitting lids.  Store garbage in rodent-proof metal or thick plastic containers with tight-fitting lids.  Wash dishes and cooking utensils immediately after use and remove all spilled food.  Dispose of trash and clutter.   Activities that should be avoided are:   Farming around rodent-infested areas  Using rodent-inhabited buildings  Cleaning barns or outbuildings infested with rodents  Disturbing rodent nests and burrows while hiking or camping   Prevent rodents from entering the home:   Use steel wool or cement to seal, screen, or otherwise cover all openings into the home that have a diameter of 1/4 inch or larger.  Place metal roof flashing as a rodent barrier around the base of wooden, earthen, or adobe dwellings up to a height of 12 inches and buried in the soil to a depth of 6 inches.  Place 3 inches of gravel under the base of homes or under mobile homes to discourage rodent burrowing.  Reduce rodent shelter and food sources within 100 feet of the home.  Use raised cement foundations in new construction of sheds, barns, outbuildings, or woodpiles.  When possible, place woodpiles 100 feet or more from the house and elevate wood at least 12 inches off the ground.  Store grains and animal feed in rodent-proof containers.  Near buildings, remove food sources that might attract rodents or store food and water in rodent-proof containers.  Store hay on pallets, and use traps or rodenticide continuously to keep hay free of rodents.  Do not leave pet food in feeding dishes.  Dispose of garbage and trash in rodent-proof containers that are elevated at least 12 inches off the ground.  Haul away trash, abandoned vehicles, discarded tires, and other items that may serve as rodent nesting sites.  Cut grass, brush, and dense shrubbery within 100 feet of the home.  Place spring-loaded traps at likely spots for rodent shelter within 100 feet around the home, and use continuously.   Clean-up Procedures   Any area where you see rodent activity such as dead rodents or rodent droppings (feces) and urine should be thoroughly cleaned.   Use wet mopping or wet cleaning methods to carefully remove rodent droppings (feces) and urine from occupied buildings.  Avoid creating dust or aerosol from rodent droppings (feces) and urine.    Wet with disinfectant before cleaning, and use wet mopping or cleaning techniques.  Do not use a vacuum cleaner or a broom because they will create airborne particles and dust.  Wear rubber gloves, long-sleeved clothing, and a dust mask.  Always wash hands with soap and warm water afterward.   Use 3 tablespoons of household chlorine bleach to a gallon of water as a disinfectant.  You may also use Lysol or other cleaners that say disinfectant on the label and have phenol on the list of ingredients.  Apply the disinfectant to the mouse droppings (feces) and urine and all areas where rodents have been at least 30 minutes before cleanup to give it a chance to work.  Dispose of droppings (feces) by burial in double plastic bags.  If droppings have been treated properly with a sanitizer, they can be double bagged and disposed in the regular trash bin.      Do not touch dead rodents.  Wet dead rodents and rodent nests with disinfectant, allowing at least 30 minutes for disinfectant to work before removing.  Dispose of rodent bodies by either picking them up with a tool and placing in a double plastic bag, which is then sealed or placing hand into a double plastic bag, picking up rodents, then reversing the bag back over the rodents and sealing.  Dispose of by burial or in the trash.  Wash gloved hands in a general household disinfectant and then in soap and water.  Wash bare hands after removing gloves.     Guidance for Hikers and Campers   Stay away from rodents and rodent burrows or dens such as pack rat nests.  Do not use cabins or other enclosed shelters that have rodents or rodent droppings (feces) and urine until they have been properly cleaned and disinfected.  Do not pitch tents or place sleeping bags near rodent droppings (feces) or burrows.  Also do not camp near places where rodents may find shelter such as garbage dumps or wood piles.  If possible, do not sleep on the bare ground.    Use a cot with the sleeping surface at least 12 inches above the ground.  Use tents with floors.    Keep food in rodent-proof containers.  Promptly bury  all garbage and trash, or discard in covered trash containers.  Use only bottled water or water that has been disinfected by filtration, boiling, chlorination or iodination for drinking, cooking, washing dishes, and brushing teeth.   Special Precautions  Homes of people infected with HPS or buildings with a great many rodents or a lot of rodent droppings (feces) need to be very carefully cleaned. You should contact your health department for specific instructions.

As far as cockroaches are concerned, common wisdom is less specific, at least from a cursory glance at the results. posted by crunchland at 10:02 PM on November 10, 2004  I so want to know the answer to this question.  I have a big fat lazy cat and a kitchen full of mice, at least judging by the mouse shit I think it's  'full'.  I mean, how much can one mouse poop? On the poop based algorithim I have at least 3287 of them living in my house. The upside is, I got one today and the rest should be running scared (while the cat sleeps). posted by cedar at 11:18 PM on November 10, 2004  I saw one in my laundry room, set a half dozen traps, and spent the next two hours in the living room  listening to SNAP! SNAP! in the back of the house as the death toll mounted.  I wound up bagging about 15 over a few days.  Oddly, I set some traps in the basement under the laundry room, same bait (peanut butter), and so far something(s) have licked the peanut butter out of about a dozen traps without springing them. So, all the stupid/clumsy ones are apparently out of the gene pool, and I'm worried I'm creating a superrace of communicating, tool-using, PhD-having mice.  Anyway, my advice is plug up the mouse entry points before you go killing, because if they can get in, you'll be fighting a never-ending supply of reinforcements. Use steel wool pushed tightly into every little chink. posted by stupidsexyFlanders at 3:26 AM on November 11, 2004  Cedar's mouse is a deer mouse, not a house mouse. You can tell the difference because deer mice are white underneath and have big eyes and ears. Deer mice (and field mice or voles with very short tails) aren't really vermin, they're wildlife. They come into houses this time of year looking for somewhere nice to spend the winter. They won't breed in your house. You'll run into them if you live in a rural/exurban area (deer mice if you're near woods, field mice if near fields). The best way to control them is to seal off your house, which you probably want to do for energy saving purposes anyway. Plug all holes with that spray foam stuff.  House mice are the same color all over and have little beady eyes. They will breed like crazy and my experience is that one means at least several. Or billions.. posted by TimeFactor at 6:52 AM on November 11, 2004  my experience with mice has repeatedly been the same as crash's posted by jessamyn at 7:11 AM on November 11, 2004  So, I've been planning on posting an anti-mouse Q for a while... but this may do just as well.  I live in an urban (read: vermin infested) setting, where there are lots of mice.  Gross, shit-all-over-my-kitchen mice.  I've tried several different types of traps and have killed, so far, about 9 mice (the glue type trap that Cedar used being the most successful) and see one scurry by most nights.  My question is this: How do I eradicate the bastards?  My house is mid-(stalled)-remodel, so my kitchen isn't really "sealable" and I live in the inner-city so I'm sure there's a huge mice population, regardless of what I do.  Should I try poison? Do I just have to live with it? Mouse droppings are so gross. posted by maniactown at 8:45 AM on November 11, 2004  maniactown -- Get a young cat (1-2 y.o.).  The smell cats emit is a natural deterrent to mice, as are their claws.

But to get rid of them, you need to understand what they do and what they like. Following are some of the most frequently asked questions -- and answers -- about mice.                                                               01  of 12            How Do I Know If I Have Mice?         Tom Mareschal/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images     Although the most obvious sign is that you have mice in your house , of course, seeing live or dead mice in your house . But there are plenty of other signs that can tell you that a mouse infestation may be building. These include: gnawed holes in stored foods, piled papers, insulation, etc. food scraps or wrappings left behind, especially in out of the way places (or in a shoe, which this author has actually seen occur!). excreted droppings - 1/4 - 1/8 inch with pointed end or ends. rodent hairs. runw ... MORE ays - narrow pathways where dust and dirt have been swept clean, grease marks are noticeable, or urine trails can be seen under black light. nests or piled nesting materials. skittering on hardwood or laminate floors the rank odor of a large infestation.              02  of 12            How Do I Know If It Is a Mouse or a Rat?             Rats are much larger than mice. Keven Law 2009     Mice are much smaller than rats . Mice are about 2 to 3 1/2 inches in length – plus another 3 to 4 inches of tail. The most common rats in the U.S. are the Norway rat and the roof rat. They will be about 14 to 16 inches in length, with tail length varying by species.              03  of 12            What Do Mice Eat?        Mice most prefer to eat cereal grains and plants, but they will feed on almost anything.              04  of 12            How Long Will a Mouse Live?        A house mouse will rarely live more than a year in the wild, but in a protected environment with food and water (like a house!), it can live up to three years.       Continue to 5 of 12 below.                  05  of 12            Why Do I Keep Finding Shredded Paper and Black Rice-Like Things?             House mouse in its nest. Liz Bomford/Photodisc/Getty Images     It is very likely that you have found a mouse nest. A mouse will build its nest from about any soft material or finely shredded paper. And the little black "rice" is most likely mouse droppings.              06  of 12            Where Should I Put Mouse Traps?        Traps should be placed where the mice are. If you have found any signs of mice – shredded paper or cloth, droppings, urine stains, gnawed items – place the traps in those areas. Traps are available from home and garden stores or even some grocery stores. Many can be reused, while others are intended to hide the trapped mouse from view and be used only once.              07  of 12            I Know I Have Mice, but My Traps Aren't Catching Them!        Mice are very curious and will investigate new things. So, if mice are not caught within the first days of trap placement, the trap is probably in the wrong place and should be moved. Place the trap where any signs of mice are seen, or where food or water is available.              08  of 12            What Is the Best Bait for Mouse Traps?             Contrary to popular belief, cheese is not the best bait for traps. Michael Cogliantry/The Image Bank/Getty Images     Contrary to popular belief, cheese is not the best bait to use in traps. Peanut butter can be very attractive to mice, but it needs to be replaced if it gets too dry or hard. Other good options are bacon, nuts, dried food, and sticky candies. The bait should be securely attached to the trap trigger so the rodent can't simply pluck it off and walk away.       Continue to 9 of 12 below.                  09  of 12            I Think I Have Mice, but I Never See Any. Why?        Mice are nocturnal creatures, so they are most active from dusk up 'til morning light. They don't usually like bright lights, but a mouse may sometimes be seen during the day, especially if its nest has been disturbed, it is seeking food, or there is a large infestation.              10  of 12            Why Are One or Two Mice a Problem?        In a single year, one female mouse can breed up to 10 litters of 5 to 6 young. These 60 offspring can begin to reproduce themselves in as little as six weeks. So within months, you could have a huge population of mice.              11  of 12            How Do Mice Get in My House?        A mouse can slip through holes and gaps as small as 1/4 inch - much smaller than appears possible. And if it's not big enough to squeeze through, the mouse can gnaw it until it is big enough. Mice also can jump 13 inches high and can run along wires, cables, and ropes. Because they are excellent jumpers, swimmers, and climbers, mice can climb even rough, vertical surfaces.              12  of 12            What Can I Do to Get Rid of Mice in My Home?             Eliminate mice by placing traps or bait where they are known to travel.     There are a number of methods of control, including traps, baits, rodenticides , and professional control .

After a little research, I decided to get the classic spring-style mouse traps. I set them with some peanut butter and after a night or two, I woke up to a dead mouse. After that, I cleaned up and set traps again. Things were quiet for a few days but then we got another hit.  A second dead mouse captured.  We were happy up until this point because we figured it was just one mouse but since we got the second one, I had to ask myself "when do I stop setting traps?" and "did the mouse come in because it smelled the peanut butter set trap?". It's sort of a catch 22 now. I am afraid that the mouse got in "because" I had peanut butter out (as part of the set trap).  I'm afraid that if I keep setting traps that I may just be inviting these little guys in.

I'd set traps until you go a few days without catching anything, then stop, but ask the dog to tell you if anyone is mooching his food :-) – Jason  Jun 27 '12 at 22:43            @Jason - Thanks for the comment. I should have mentioned that I stopped leaving food out over night for the dog so that shouldn't be a source any longer. – Brian  Jun 27 '12 at 22:45        4      There is never just one mouse. ;) – DA01  Jun 28 '12 at 5:16        1      At least it sounds like your traps are in an accessible area. I had mice in my attic for the longest time. I'd set the traps out for a few days and catch 2-3 mice. Fast forward a couple weeks later, and there would be scurrying sounds coming from the attic again. Eventually I ended up forgetting I had put the traps in the attic. Three weeks later, I found the maggot-filled corpse of a very unlucky mouse in a trap I had forgotten to check. – Doresoom  Jun 28 '12 at 21:36            I've heard from a pest control expert that they start in your attic, travel down through the basement then meet u in the middle in the living space...& that's when u know u have an infestation! – user7541  Sep 24 '12 at 22:40        |  show 1 more comment          4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  12  down vote  accepted      Setting traps will kill what you have, but you still have the problem of the mice getting in. you need to figure out how they are getting into the house. Mice can get through incredibly tiny holes, so it might be a chore to find them all. But as you find holes, seal them up. Steel wool is useful for this as they don't like chewing through it.     share | improve this answer     answered Jun 28 '12 at 5:17       DA01   20.7k 15 50 109              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      I personally go with 'forever'. I've got a good-size house, on a little bit land, and a garage door that I leave open for fair amounts of time each day in good weather. I'm ALWAYS going to have mice getting in, even though I've patched every hole I can find. It's just sort of inevitable at this point. So I keep the snap-traps under the sink and in the basement. I check them every couple of weeks, change the bait (I like cheese) now and then, and I get a few mice every year.  But no major infestations, and they don't seem to get past my initial trap points, so I don't get them in the pantry or anything.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 25 '12 at 1:14       Michael Kohne   2,711 3 16 26              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      According to the CDC's website, keep putting out the mouse traps and after five straight days of no mice, you should be in the clear.  I did that in our attic and it seemed to do the trick --- and yes, there is always more than one... we caught 5 in 5 days.  Three traps were left with peanut butter and no catches.  After 30 days, I put out two traps again just to make sure and after five days there were no more catches.  I recommend the 5 day rule.  Oh, and my recommendation with the snap traps.  You don't have to touch the trap/mice if you put the trap in a small box (shoe size or smaller) before putting it in your basement/attic.     share | improve this answer      edited Sep 30 '16 at 20:02             answered Sep 30 '16 at 19:52       Mary C   21 2                  Putting the trap in a box, with appropriate baffle and some weight on top of it, is also one way to cat-proof mousetraps. – keshlam  Oct 3 '16 at 0:34        1      Can you provide a link to the CDC website where you found that information? – mmathis  Oct 24 '16 at 22:05        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      For what it's worth, I decided to contract with a pest control company for ongoing service. Periodically they refill the bait containers in the basement, and this has been sufficient to keep any mice from nesting in the attic. I don't like bait a lot -- among other things I worry about a poisoned-but-not-dead-yet mouse being found by a cat -- but it has been effective.  Reportedly, old style snap-the-neck traps are actually the least painful killing trap, but of course those have to be more actively maintained. Nonkilling traps are a nice idea but you have to empty them somewhere before the mice starve; I think what I really want is a nonkilling trap that sends email when it has caught something.  Warning: Mice often carry ticks, and in some areas ticks can carry  things like Lyme disease. Be careful when disposing of carcasses. I've been tempted to put out Daminix as well, though it isn't cheap.     share | improve this answer      edited Sep 30 '16 at 22:00             answered Aug 23 '16 at 0:58       keshlam   14.7k 2 25 52              add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .
