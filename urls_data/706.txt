You are driving a 10 year old SUV that is in OK shape with tags from CA.  2. You average 5 MPH over the speed limit and never drive erratically.  3. You drive for 10 hours and sleep for 8 hours until your destination. So you are driving during the day and night during the trip.  I would guess 25%. Purely based on the fact that most of the country would love to pull over a fruity CA car.         #1   FP ,   Dec 1, 2008                      Jschmuck2  Diamond Member       Joined:  Jul 13, 2005    Messages:  5,624    Likes Received:  1          Renew your license before you go.       #2   Jschmuck2 ,   Dec 1, 2008                      QurazyQuisp  Platinum Member       Joined:  Feb 5, 2003    Messages:  2,555    Likes Received:  0          I would say 1%.

I've driven over 100,000 miles in the last year while on the job, and was never pulled over once. Of course, I was only going between Oregon and California, but lol.       #4   Eli ,   Dec 1, 2008                      glenn1  Elite Member       Joined:  Sep 6, 2000    Messages:  22,412    Likes Received:  423          Agreed, presuming he's using major interstates where the main police presence is state troopers.  If he's using state highways and such, then he'll run into a lot more small town cops, then 25% is probably about right.        #5   glenn1 ,   Dec 1, 2008                      EagleKeeper  Discussion Club Moderator<br>Elite Member   Staff Member      Joined:  Oct 30, 2000    Messages:  42,600    Likes Received:  1          6 trips coast to coast over the past 5 years in sedan -3 in SUV  Stayed no more than 7-8 mph over limit.

Unless you were unlucky enough to roll through a truly dishonest speed trap like one of the towns that gets their entire budget by such things you'd have to be VERY unlucky to be stopped. Cops don't notice 5 over on its own, it takes something else to get their attention.       #7   GagHalfrunt ,   Dec 1, 2008                       vi edit  Elite Member <br> Super Moderator   Super Moderator      Joined:  Oct 28, 1999    Messages:  58,522    Likes Received:  1,623          5% over on major interstates?

Click to expand...   I think this is more important than anything.  Example: Friday I was cruising in the middle lane, with moderate traffic.  We were doing about 73 in a 55, and I  passed four speed traps.  Two staties and two locals.  Neither of which pulled out, because traffic was moving that fast.  But I was in the car with a friend who was pulled over for doing 62 on that very same stretch of road.  Only because we were the only car on the road - and thus the fastest.  =/         #15   BlackTigers ,   Dec 1, 2008                      BoomerD  Lifer       Joined:  Feb 26, 2006    Messages:  49,975    Likes Received:  1,123          We drove from Kahleeforneeya to Wisconsin, then the long way back (through Washington State) (6200 miles)  and the ONLY time we got pulled over was in outside a small town in Iowa. The Expedition was brand new and we didn't have ANY plates on the truck yet. Only took a few minutes to prove to the IHP that we wern't car thieves and that the vehicle was legal... and we were off again.  I really don't think Kahleeforneeya plates should be an issue anywhere unless the cop is just a prick with ears and a badge...and is looking for SOMETHING to fill his quota...        #16   BoomerD ,   Dec 1, 2008                      rezinn  Platinum Member       Joined:  Mar 30, 2004    Messages:  2,421    Likes Received:  0          I'd say zero. You're not special just because you have california plates. Just don't go a lot faster than everyone else and you won't get pulled over.       #17   rezinn ,   Dec 1, 2008                      nerp  Diamond Member       Joined:  Dec 31, 2005    Messages:  9,794    Likes Received:  67          I drove cross country and back in the summer of 2004 and didn't get stopped once. We hit 80-90mph on the 70mph limit freeways in the midwest. Passed cops on the highway. No problems. As long as you're not driving like a maniac and passing other cars liek crazy, you're good.       #18   nerp ,   Dec 1, 2008                      thescreensavers  Diamond Member       Joined:  Aug 3, 2005    Messages:  9,928    Likes Received:  1          less then 1% of speeding tickets are below 10 mph       #19   thescreensavers ,   Dec 1, 2008                      Capt Caveman  Lifer       Joined:  Jan 30, 2005    Messages:  34,278    Likes Received:  466          1%   I've driven back and forth cross country with MA and CA plates.

Or a person driving while texting. And, if we’re honest, maybe we’ve even been that person. Nobody’s perfect. But when you’re trying to avoid being pulled over (which most of us are), it helps to know more about those bad driving habits we’ve all been (admittedly) guilty of at some point. Edmunds.com polled 3 police agencies to get an idea of the most common driving no-no’s that cops encounter . So, in the ongoing interest of helping us all become model motorists, here’s what Johnny Law had to say: Speeding (pulled over because you can’t drive 55 … in a 35 mph zone) In the Edmunds survey, every cop surveyed listed stopping speeding drivers as a main priority. So why do police officers key in on speeders? Well, issuing speeding tickets has a huge impact on safety. For every 100 extra speeding citations given in a month, there are 14.3 fewer crashes and 5.6 fewer injuries. Point is, if your need for speed gets the better of you, be prepared to put your money where your lead foot is — a whopping 34 million speeding tickets are handed out each year in the U.S. Distracted driving (pulled over because you’re texting, emailing, eating, and driving) The police officers surveyed say their main reasons for giving distracted-driving tickets include illegal texting and driving or other dangerous cell phone use. And with good reason, too. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a stunning 40 percent of U.S. teens admit to having been in a car while the driver used a cell phone in an endangering way. We don’t know about you, but it seems this phenomenon can’t get enough police intervention. Equipment violations (pulled over because those windows are just a bit too dark) Equipment offenses are easy bait for tickets because they’re so simple to spot. A police officer doesn’t have to make any judgments about the situation. Rather, he or she can simply see that something isn’t up to code and make a move. According to the cops surveyed, the most glaring violation (pun intended) was illegal window tints. Following that were burned-out lights, broken windshields, and expired license plate tags. Tailgating and improper lane changes (pulled over because you’re bound to cause an accident) These 2 violations ranked as equally important on the Edmunds study. Both are reckless maneuvers that cops said they monitor closely. One police officer even qualified exactly what he thinks is considered a dangerous lane change: cutting someone off or moving without looking. Using the left lane for cruising instead of passing, driving too slowly, and squealing your tires are also high on the list. Use common sense When reviewing these offenses, it’s not exactly a surprise that they attract attention. True, you can’t control what other people will do on the road. But you can control yourself. So next time you notice you’re about to fall into one of these habits, think about the repercussions. Safe driving is good for you and everyone else on the road.

Traffic Stops     On This Page         About this Topic  Data Collections & Surveys  Publications & Products               About this Topic       The most common reason for contact with the police is being a driver in a traffic stop. In 2011, an estimated 42% of face-to-face contacts that U.S. residents had with police occurred for this reason. About half of all traffic stops that year resulted in a traffic ticket. Approximately 3% of all stopped drivers were searched by police during a traffic stop.  These findings are based on the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS), a BJS survey that interviews U.S. residents about their contacts with police during the previous 12 months. Persons who reported more than one instance of face-to-face contact during the year are asked to describe the most recent occurrence. The PPCS has been conducted about every three years since 1996.  Summary findings   An estimated 26.4 million persons age 16 or older indicated that their most recent contact with the police in 2011 was as a driver pulled over in a traffic stop. These drivers represented 12% of the nation's 212 million drivers.  A greater percentage of male drivers (12%) than female drivers (8%) were stopped by police during 2011.  A higher percentage of black drivers (13%) than white (10%) and Hispanic (10%) drivers were stopped by police during 2011.  Stopped drivers reported speeding as the most common reason for being pulled over in 2011.  Approximately 80% of drivers pulled over by police in 2011 felt they had been stopped for a legitimate reason. In 2011, about 68% of black drivers believed police had a legitimate reason for stopping them compared to 84% of white and 74% of Hispanic drivers.  In 2011, about 3% of traffic stops led to a search of the driver, the vehicle, or both. Police were more likely to search male drivers (4%) than female drivers (2%).  A lower percentage of white drivers stopped by police in 2011 were searched (2%) than black (6%) or Hispanic (7%) drivers.

(WhiteHouse.gov)     Last October, President Obama told a gathering of police chiefs in Chicago about one way he had experienced racial bias before coming to the White House — while driving on the road.  "[M]ost of the time I got a ticket, I deserved it. I knew why I was pulled over. But there were times where I didn't," he said . "[T]here are a lot of African-Americans — not just me — who have that same kind of story of being pulled over. ...[T]he data shows that this is not an aberration. It doesn't mean each case is a problem. It means that when you aggregate all the cases and you look at it, you've got to say that there’s some racial bias in the system."  The fact that blacks get pulled over more than whites while on the road has long been a fact of American life. And on Wednesday evening, that reality became deadly when a Minnesota police officer shot and killed a black driver following a routine stop for a broken tail light, just one day after another fatal police shooting in Louisiana. (The violence continued in Dallas Thursday night, when snipers killed five police officers and injured more.)            1 of 58        Full Screen  Autoplay   Close                                                                                                                                          Skip Ad    ×            Protests in Minnesota and D.C. after a black man was fatally shot during a traffic stop       View Photos    Protesters gather in Falcon Heights, a St. Paul suburb, after the killing of 32-year-old Philando Castile.

While Obama is correct in asserting that blacks are disproportionately pulled over, it's actually rather hard to assess how much of the disparity is driven by racial discrimination by police officers. Data on driver race in police records is sparse, and it's hard to capture what's happening on a national scale. But what research has been done reveals a few key trends:  1) A survey released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2014 found that nationwide, 13 percent of black drivers were stopped at least once by police during 2011, the last available data. For white drivers, that figure was 10 percent. Since this only captures whether drivers were stopped once, the disparity could be much bigger if black drivers were stopped more frequently than white drivers.     Though the BJS has not released more recent data, some individual states have these statistics, giving us reason to believe this pattern hasn’t gone away.  A study of Connecticut traffic stops in 2014 and 2015 — among the states with the most recent data — found that 14 percent of traffic stops targeted black drivers, despite them making up only 9 percent of the state’s population. Whites, on the other hand, made up 70 percent of the traffic stops, but about 80 percent of the population.  They also found the racial disparity was larger during the day than at night, when the officer can easily observe their race before turning on the sirens. The analogous statistic was not available for white drivers.  2) The racial disparity isn’t just limited to stops. Other police-driver contact — searches, tickets, arrests and license suspensions — show similar racial skews. A 2015 New York Times analysis found “wide racial differences in measure after measure of police conduct” in Ferguson, Mo., as well as in Connecticut, Illinois, North Carolina and Rhode Island, the states with the most comprehensive traffic stop data.  The Times analysis found that among the largest police departments in each of those four states, black drivers were between 1.5 and 5.2 times more likely to have their cars searched than white drivers.  These searches occur with the consent of the driver, so the officer doesn't need to meet any legal standard, like probable cause, to initiate one. Of course, he would need cause to pull over the driver in the first place, though minor violations like going a few miles over the speed limit or shifting lanes without a turn signal can offer that.       3) These disparities extend to other types of traffic stops. As far as tickets, a study of traffic stops in Bloomfield, N.J., released in April uncovered a high level of discrimination in ticketing. The majority-white town issued more than 80 percent of its tickets to black and Latino drivers from September 2014 to August 2015.  There are limits to what one can infer from one city, but same pattern was found across Connecticut. A 2015 analysis by the Hartford Courant found that black and Hispanic drivers who were stopped were 11 to 41 percent more likely to be ticketed than white offenders, depending on the offense committed.  And suspended licenses tell the same story. A report released earlier this year found that in California, black and Latino drivers are more likely than white drivers to be arrested for driving on a license suspended because of unpaid tickets, and minority neighborhoods have higher rates of license suspension than white ones.  4) While the data show conclusively that blacks have a disproportionate number of encounters with police at traffic stops, it hasn't shed much light on what portion of the disparity in all these metrics is driven by racial discrimination, and what portion is attributable to non-racial factors.  According to the National Institute of Justice , the research arm of the Department of Justice , other factors could include a difference in driving patterns — that is, if black drivers tend to just drive more miles than white drivers in certain jurisdictions, they could be stopped more often in those jurisdictions but have the same number of stops per mile. That would indicate against racial discrimination.  Further, black drivers could disproportionately drive in areas with a larger police presence, so they’re more likely to be pulled over than white drivers in less policed areas even without racial profiling by the police. Of course, if this is the case, it’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. Are blacks pulled over disproportionately because they drive through highly policed areas (not discrimination), or are police highly packed into those areas because there are more black drivers (discrimination)?  The NIJ also cites a possible difference in committing stoppable offenses. Though many  studies find no difference between whites and blacks in driving habits, there is some evidence that seat-belt use is lower among black drivers and passengers, which could prompt disproportionate stops and tickets.  5) The situation gets even more complicated with respect to vehicle searches. In this case, it's less likely that these other factors are at work. It's more likely either statistical discrimination (targeting black people because they're more likely to be carrying contraband) and outright prejudice (targeting black people because of animus toward them). The first would indicate that black people are searched more because they’re more likely to carry contraband, while the latter would say that black people are searched more often because the police have an antagonism toward them.  It’s an important difference — the former is a result of the police maximizing the number of offenders who are caught, whereas the latter is a result of the police seeking to punish black drivers. The former — what people usually mean when they say "racial profiling" — is ethically controversial for literally targeting people of certain skin colors, but sometimes defended as merely an efficient use of resources. The latter, not so much.  In simple terms, the impact of these two types of discrimination can be compared by looking at the rate people of each race are caught with contraband after they’ve been searched. If black drivers are consistently less likely to be caught with contraband  than whites, that means the police are spending their time searching less-suspicious blacks rather than more-suspicious whites, indicating prejudice.  A 2006 study of police searches in Florida found no evidence of prejudice, but evidence of statistical discrimination. More recent figures from 2014 and 2015 published by the New York Times show blacks who are searched are around 20 percent less likely to be carrying contraband than whites who are searched. While that certainly raises the odds that prejudice is playing a role, it can't be said for certain without a more careful study.  To some, however, the distinction between statistical discrimination and outright prejudice isn't so great. “Racial profiling sends the dehumanizing message to our citizens that they are judged by the color of their skin,” reads a fact sheet from the Department of Justice. It cited a “moral obligation” to prohibit the practice. In other words, the department finds both statistical discrimination and prejudice to be unethical.  But others argue that racial discrimination in law enforcement is a cost-effective way to fight crime, a way to apprehend the most guilty people with the fewest officer hours.  New York City, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg,  fought to defend its “stop, question, and frisk” policy in court. Officers disproportionately stopped blacks by a large margin under the policy; that is, the officers statistically discriminated against them. The city's defense in court focused on the policy's impact — how many weapons were confiscated, how much crime had fallen — and less so on the racial disparity. The policy was struck down as an illegal search in federal court in 2013. The city filed an appeal at first, but Mayor Bill DeBlasio withdrew it after he assumed office, ending the practice.  Ethics aside, this is where the research leaves us: Black drivers certainly get more face-time with traffic cops. But to what extent that reflects discrimination, and whether that discrimination is based in racial prejudice, is more of an open question.       The officer who fatally shot Philando Castile, 32, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter.

And for what?  By  Andrew Ba Tran | July 6, 2015  Like Tweet  Email Print  More     More on Crime   Subscribe to Crime            Andrew Ba Tran Data Editor    The day before the Fourth of July produced the fifth-highest daily count of traffic stops last year in Connecticut.  This is according to traffic-stop data from the Office of Policy and Management, which is available because of a law compelling law enforcement agencies to electronically submit their traffic-stop information. Analysts have looked at the data and said they found significant racial disparities in some municipal departments and State Police troops.  But there is still more to discover in such a rich data set.  So TrendCT took a deeper look at the nearly 600,000 tickets issued in Connecticut between October 2013 and September 2014. We’ll be running several stories looking at various parts of the data. But today, we’re looking at when police most often pull drivers over — and for what.  When are you most likely to get pulled over?  We’ll start with the raw totals throughout the year.   It’s easier to see why some days have such a high tally, given their proximity to federal holidays. More people on the road means more opportunities for citations.  But a couple of days in May and September are among the 10 days with the most traffic stops. If anyone knows why those days in particular seem to yield a high number of tickets, let us know in the comments below.     Daily average number of tickets  Based on the first seven days, the last seven days, and the days between of each month.     First week  Middle weeks  Last week      6,333  6,453  6,764     CTData Collaborative   Those high-volume days, plus Memorial Day and Labor Day, make September and May the heaviest months of the year for drivers getting pulled over.  The colder months of February and December are periods when police stop drivers the least.  More stops occur on average during the last seven days of the month versus all other days. In fact, days during the last week of the month yield about 400 more traffic stops on average than days during the first week.  What are drivers most often ticketed for?  More than 25 percent of all drivers getting pulled over in Connecticut were speed-related, making it the top offense.  Interestingly, cell phone use while driving is the category with the fourth-most stops. It was introduced as a violation in 2005 . The state police pulled drivers the most for this violation (15,718 tickets), followed by Danbury and Wallingford (2,465 and 1,339 respectively).   The generic “Other” is the second-most-common reason drivers get stopped. “Other” could refer to things like violating exhaust emission inspection requirements and driving without a license.  But looking more closely, about 48 percent of all “Other” traffic stops were for “ failure to observe parkway or expressway restrictions “. This could be interpreted as a way for officers to ticket drivers for exceeding the speed limit, but without the higher fines and consequences of a speeding ticket.

Here are some ideas to avoid getting pulled over in the first place.   1. Drive the Speed Limit. I know this is obvious, but if you aren’t running late, it might be something to seriously consider.  An additional benefit of following the speed limit (versus speeding) is an increase in gas mileage.  That’s a win-win reason.  2. Middle of the Pack. Need to speed? Find a group of cars going the speed you want and hang out in the middle.  The first car is likely to trigger a cop radar, and the last car is likely to get pulled over first.  Hanging out in the middle is a safer placer to be if you need to speed.  3. Follow a Speeder. Put some distance between you and the speeder and let him trigger the radar.  The distance allows you enough time to slow down when the cop pulls out.     4. Drive a decent car. Speaking from personal experience, if you’re driving a beat-up car with the paint peeling off – cops will find a reason to pull you over.  If you’re driving a decent car that blends in, you won’t draw extra attention to yourself.  5. Relax. Aggressive driving will only draw extra attention to yourself.  So even if some jerk cuts you off or drives 10 under the speed limit, take a deep breath and relax.  When you can safely get around the person, remind yourself to relax and avoid the old, “I’m going to teach him a lesson” philosophy.  6. Pay Attention. If you commute the same way to work every day, start paying attention.  Notice where the cops sit, or where there are turnouts for cops to hide.  Make note of them and slow down accordingly.  7. Leave on time. The biggest reason for speeding is that you are late .  Leave on time, and enjoy your ride to your destination without the anxiety, stress, and pressure to speed.   8. Don’t drive. This is a very great way to avoid getting pulled over.  By taking the bus or riding your bike, you’re helping the environment, saving money on gas, reducing traffic problems, and you’re avoiding potential traffic violations. Another win-win reason.  9. Hang Up. Or get a hands-free device.  If you’re the only one on your cell phone in a pack of speeding vehicles, you just increased your chances of getting pulled over.  10. Keep your registration updated. And put the sticker on!  Don’t let yourself get pulled over because you’re too lazy to put the little sticker on your car.  You’ll feel like a fool when the cop walks up to your car and you have the stickers sitting next to you.  That reason also comes from personal experience.  11. You’re not in the clear. Just because you see someone else pulled over doesn’t mean that you’re in the clear.  Speed traps often come in pairs – it’s part of the setup.  So give yourself a few miles before speeding up again.  12. Easy on the Holidays. Whether it’s Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Labor Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, or any of the other number of holidays, take it easy.  Cops working on holidays are probably not too happy about it.  They’ll be looking for people to punish.  And you don’t want that to be you.  13. Watch your back. While your scanning the road in front of you in search for cops, don’t forget to look back.  You don’t want to be driving for miles with a cop behind you (and lights on).  14. Flashed. If you just got flashed (someone’s brights flashed at you) and you didn’t have your brights on, the driver might be warning you about a speed trap they just passed.  Don’t risk it.  Slow down and play it safe.  The next time you pass a speed trap, pass the favor on.  15. Volunteer. At your local police department.  Get to know the officers, let them know what your car looks like, and enjoy the advantages of your new friends.  Plus you’ll be helping at your community – that will balance out that karma for your speeding and aggressive driving.  16. Seatbelt. Seat belts save lives, and in most places it’s against the law to not wear one.  So be smart – buckling up could save your life and help you avoid getting pulled over.  Another win-win reason.    17. Follow the Law. The BEST way to avoid getting pulled over is to follow the law, which I encourage.  Keep yourself and the rest of us safe on the road by following those annoying laws.  Thank You!

For those of us who have avoided run-ins with law while driving, and have not accrued a mountain of traffic tickets, people often say, “Geez you’re lucky you never get pulled over, I get nailed by the police all the time!”   Well sadly, for all intensive purposes, there is no such thing as luck. Luck is a fanciful idea, similar to hopes, dreams, and wishes. There is no guarantee that luck will be on your side, that your hopes will be met, dreams achieved, or wishes granted. We live in a cold harsh world, which contrary to what many may believe, is filled with absolute certainties. With that in mind, it’s best if we understand that what people refer to as “luck”, is really nothing more than the residue of design. How you design something entirely creates the chance of all possible outcomes.  So when driving, have you considered the residue of your designs? Do you know the things that drastically increase your chance of being pulled over? Because next time you breeze through a red light, coast through a stop sign, or are speeding on your way home and notice a police cruiser that has not turned on its lights to chase you down, that is not attributed to luck. The police officer either didn’t see you, or had something more important to do. There is no luck present in that scenario, if they did notice you and had the time, no doubt they would have pulled you over. So without further ado, lets discuss what you should be aware of when driving to avoid being pulled over.  Driving Over The Speed Limit  Nothing will catch a police officer’s attention more than speeding, and more than that, excessive speeding. With speed cameras often placed around cities and at certain intersections, it’s even more important not to speed because nowadays, a police officer doesn’t even need to be in site for you to receive a speeding ticket.  Illegal Use Of A Phone  Many states currently have anti-texting laws in place, and rightly so. Doing anything but pay attention while you are driving does nothing more than distract you, and focus is certainly required while behind the wheel. But an officer can see you holding your phone or you looking into your lap for a long period of time and assume you are texting or simply fiddling with your phone. Remember, anti-texting laws don’t simply mean you are physically texting. You could be reading a text, Facebook updates, emails, or anything else and would fall under these laws. People are still allowed to talk on their phones, but even that is discouraged. So unless you are at a stop light, keep your phone away. There’s no need to tempt police.  Hazardous Driving  Peeling out at stop lights, swerving, and overall just erratic driving is a huge red flag for police officers. They can assume you are racing, drunk, under the influence of drugs, and any other number of things. And you have to remember that police don’t have to “know” you are racing, drunk, or driving on drugs. They just have to have reason to believe that, and if you’re all over the place on the road driving like Evel Knievel, they have all the right to believe just that.  Equipment Violations  There are reasons we have the laws in place that we do. Headlights allow you to see at night, as well as allow others to see you. Turn signals and brake lights help to alert other drivers of your intentions. A crack in your windshield obstructs your vision. Even overly tinted windows reduce visibility, which is a danger when driving. Bumpers are securely attached to protect you and other drivers in the event of an accident. Rear view mirrors help so you know what is going on around you. In the end, there are numerous reasons for the laws we have in place for properly functioning vehicle equipment, and if any of those seem to be damaged or improperly working, a police officer will pull you over.  Tailgating  The law of the road is for every 10mph you are traveling, you are to provide 1 car length, roughly 15 ft, between you and the vehicle in front of you. Oddly, this seems excessive when you imagine what the highway looks like during rush hour. But if you do not follow this, and follow the vehicle in front of you too closely, you can be pulled over and ticketed. Now, considering there is no real way to determine the exact footage between two vehicles moving, it’s up to the officers discretion. But understand, if you’re traveling 45mph and are around 2 car lengths behind the vehicle in front of you, this is noticeable and knowing the exact footage doesn’t matter for an officer to pull you over.  Improper Lane Changes  When you switch lanes there are a few things to keep in mind. 1. Never change lanes traveling through an intersection. 2. Never change lanes over solid colors road lines. 3. You need to provide 3 seconds of warning, meaning the use of your blinker, before switching lanes to allow other drivers to account for your vehicle moving over. If you go against any of those three points, an officer will notice immediately and pull you over.  Driving Too Slowly  Most people are in a rush to get where they are going. So it is extremely suspicious when an officer sees a vehicle driving too far below the speed limit. They can assume something is wrong, you’re drunk or high, and any other number of possible problems. It is also illegal to travel too slow on some roads, mainly the highway. If you’re in the left lane in a 65 mph area, and are only going 45 mph, you are putting other drivers at risk for driving too slowly. The extra 20 mph may not be accounted for when a vehicle is approaching or changing lanes and can cause driver to become erratic due to being impatient. It’s an odd law, because you would think the slower the safer, but on certain roadways this is not the case.  Using The Left Lane Without Having To Pass  You shouldn’t continually use the left lane unless you are passing other vehicles. In fact, that is the only reason there left lanes, which are meant to be used in passing. What it has turned into is a lane for those that want to go faster, but that was not its purpose. Unless you have a turn coming up, or are passing a person in the right lane, stay in the right lane. The left lane is closest to the left lane of the oncoming direction, and to keep everyone safer, those lanes are intended to stay open unless needed. If you are all alone on the road, and have been driving in the left lane for a while, albeit even going the speed limit, it gives police officers a reason to at least take note of you. And when trying to avoid being pulled over all together, being noticed for any reason is unwanted.  Failure To Wear A Seatbelt  Click it or ticket! We’ve all heard that slogan before and the bark of it is much better than the bite. There is no worse feeling than being pulled over, and when asked if you know why you were pulled over, while not knowing, the police officer mentions they noticed you didn’t have your seatbelt on. The fine associated with this is often steep as well. So to avoid being given a ticket because you weren’t protecting yourself, do yourself a favor. Wear your seatbelt, protect yourself, and protect your hard earned cash as well. It takes 4 seconds to put your seatbelt on, which is better than brain damage or a $160 ticket.  Questionable Activities  If you are driving around, there could be many things going on in your car which to an outsider may look much different. Smoking a cigarette may look like a joint of marijuana, drinking a bottled soda may look like a beer. Asking your kid to get something out of the backseat may look like your allowing your child to romp all over the vehicle without wearing a seatbelt. Point being, there are a number of things to be self-aware of, and though you will certainly feel it’s not fair you were pulled over, from the police officers perspective, it was a vastly different story.

What Are the Odds of Getting Pulled Over By the Cops?

Hispanic and black drivers are more likely than their white counterparts to be searched and ticketed when they are pulled over. According to the statistics, though, force is not used as often as you might think.  Police use force in traffic stops 1.2% of the time. That’s a lot less than you might think because of constant news stories about excessive force. Even drivers upon whom force was used typically think it was necessary in hindsight, according to survey results.  The prison population is another story, though. Whereas your odds of being pulled over vary according to your race by 4 or 5 percentage points, blacks and Hispanics are considerably more likely than their white counterparts to spend time in prison.

You are driving a 10 year old SUV that is in OK shape with tags from CA.  2. You average 5 MPH over the speed limit and never drive erratically.  3. You drive for 10 hours and sleep for 8 hours until your destination. So you are driving during the day and night during the trip.  I would guess 25%. Purely based on the fact that most of the country would love to pull over a fruity CA car.         #1   FP ,   Dec 1, 2008                      Jschmuck2  Diamond Member       Joined:  Jul 13, 2005    Messages:  5,624    Likes Received:  1          Renew your license before you go.       #2   Jschmuck2 ,   Dec 1, 2008                      QurazyQuisp  Platinum Member       Joined:  Feb 5, 2003    Messages:  2,555    Likes Received:  0          I would say 1%.

If he's using state highways and such, then he'll run into a lot more small town cops, then 25% is probably about right.        #5   glenn1 ,   Dec 1, 2008                      EagleKeeper  Discussion Club Moderator<br>Elite Member   Staff Member      Joined:  Oct 30, 2000    Messages:  42,600    Likes Received:  1          6 trips coast to coast over the past 5 years in sedan -3 in SUV  Stayed no more than 7-8 mph over limit.

Unless you were unlucky enough to roll through a truly dishonest speed trap like one of the towns that gets their entire budget by such things you'd have to be VERY unlucky to be stopped. Cops don't notice 5 over on its own, it takes something else to get their attention.       #7   GagHalfrunt ,   Dec 1, 2008                       vi edit  Elite Member <br> Super Moderator   Super Moderator      Joined:  Oct 28, 1999    Messages:  58,522    Likes Received:  1,623          5% over on major interstates?

Just make sure that you drive sensibly, and are never the fastest guy on the road.       #12   arrfep ,   Dec 1, 2008                      Farang  Lifer       Joined:  Jul 7, 2003    Messages:  10,922    Likes Received:  1          I haven't been pulled over for around 20,000 miles so I'd say 0.1%. I usually go 10 over and have done over 100 hours of long distance driving (300+ miles) and countless miles on state highways during that time.       #13   Farang ,   Dec 1, 2008                      zzuupp  Lifer       Joined:  Jul 6, 2008    Messages:  12,889    Likes Received:  1,333          On the interstates, more like 0%.       #14   zzuupp ,   Dec 1, 2008                      BlackTigers  Diamond Member       Joined:  Jan 15, 2006    Messages:  4,493    Likes Received:  1             Originally posted by: arrfep Just make sure that you drive sensibly, and are never the fastest guy on the road. Click to expand...   I think this is more important than anything.  Example: Friday I was cruising in the middle lane, with moderate traffic.  We were doing about 73 in a 55, and I  passed four speed traps.  Two staties and two locals.  Neither of which pulled out, because traffic was moving that fast.  But I was in the car with a friend who was pulled over for doing 62 on that very same stretch of road.  Only because we were the only car on the road - and thus the fastest.  =/         #15   BlackTigers ,   Dec 1, 2008                      BoomerD  Lifer       Joined:  Feb 26, 2006    Messages:  49,975    Likes Received:  1,123          We drove from Kahleeforneeya to Wisconsin, then the long way back (through Washington State) (6200 miles)  and the ONLY time we got pulled over was in outside a small town in Iowa. The Expedition was brand new and we didn't have ANY plates on the truck yet. Only took a few minutes to prove to the IHP that we wern't car thieves and that the vehicle was legal... and we were off again.  I really don't think Kahleeforneeya plates should be an issue anywhere unless the cop is just a prick with ears and a badge...and is looking for SOMETHING to fill his quota...        #16   BoomerD ,   Dec 1, 2008                      rezinn  Platinum Member       Joined:  Mar 30, 2004    Messages:  2,421    Likes Received:  0          I'd say zero. You're not special just because you have california plates. Just don't go a lot faster than everyone else and you won't get pulled over.       #17   rezinn ,   Dec 1, 2008                      nerp  Diamond Member       Joined:  Dec 31, 2005    Messages:  9,794    Likes Received:  67          I drove cross country and back in the summer of 2004 and didn't get stopped once. We hit 80-90mph on the 70mph limit freeways in the midwest. Passed cops on the highway. No problems. As long as you're not driving like a maniac and passing other cars liek crazy, you're good.       #18   nerp ,   Dec 1, 2008                      thescreensavers  Diamond Member       Joined:  Aug 3, 2005    Messages:  9,928    Likes Received:  1          less then 1% of speeding tickets are below 10 mph       #19   thescreensavers ,   Dec 1, 2008                      Capt Caveman  Lifer       Joined:  Jan 30, 2005    Messages:  34,278    Likes Received:  466          1%   I've driven back and forth cross country with MA and CA plates.

Or a person driving while texting. And, if we’re honest, maybe we’ve even been that person. Nobody’s perfect. But when you’re trying to avoid being pulled over (which most of us are), it helps to know more about those bad driving habits we’ve all been (admittedly) guilty of at some point. Edmunds.com polled 3 police agencies to get an idea of the most common driving no-no’s that cops encounter . So, in the ongoing interest of helping us all become model motorists, here’s what Johnny Law had to say: Speeding (pulled over because you can’t drive 55 … in a 35 mph zone) In the Edmunds survey, every cop surveyed listed stopping speeding drivers as a main priority. So why do police officers key in on speeders? Well, issuing speeding tickets has a huge impact on safety. For every 100 extra speeding citations given in a month, there are 14.3 fewer crashes and 5.6 fewer injuries. Point is, if your need for speed gets the better of you, be prepared to put your money where your lead foot is — a whopping 34 million speeding tickets are handed out each year in the U.S. Distracted driving (pulled over because you’re texting, emailing, eating, and driving) The police officers surveyed say their main reasons for giving distracted-driving tickets include illegal texting and driving or other dangerous cell phone use. And with good reason, too. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a stunning 40 percent of U.S. teens admit to having been in a car while the driver used a cell phone in an endangering way. We don’t know about you, but it seems this phenomenon can’t get enough police intervention. Equipment violations (pulled over because those windows are just a bit too dark) Equipment offenses are easy bait for tickets because they’re so simple to spot. A police officer doesn’t have to make any judgments about the situation. Rather, he or she can simply see that something isn’t up to code and make a move. According to the cops surveyed, the most glaring violation (pun intended) was illegal window tints. Following that were burned-out lights, broken windshields, and expired license plate tags. Tailgating and improper lane changes (pulled over because you’re bound to cause an accident) These 2 violations ranked as equally important on the Edmunds study. Both are reckless maneuvers that cops said they monitor closely. One police officer even qualified exactly what he thinks is considered a dangerous lane change: cutting someone off or moving without looking. Using the left lane for cruising instead of passing, driving too slowly, and squealing your tires are also high on the list. Use common sense When reviewing these offenses, it’s not exactly a surprise that they attract attention. True, you can’t control what other people will do on the road. But you can control yourself. So next time you notice you’re about to fall into one of these habits, think about the repercussions. Safe driving is good for you and everyone else on the road.

Traffic Stops     On This Page         About this Topic  Data Collections & Surveys  Publications & Products               About this Topic       The most common reason for contact with the police is being a driver in a traffic stop. In 2011, an estimated 42% of face-to-face contacts that U.S. residents had with police occurred for this reason. About half of all traffic stops that year resulted in a traffic ticket. Approximately 3% of all stopped drivers were searched by police during a traffic stop.  These findings are based on the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS), a BJS survey that interviews U.S. residents about their contacts with police during the previous 12 months. Persons who reported more than one instance of face-to-face contact during the year are asked to describe the most recent occurrence. The PPCS has been conducted about every three years since 1996.  Summary findings   An estimated 26.4 million persons age 16 or older indicated that their most recent contact with the police in 2011 was as a driver pulled over in a traffic stop. These drivers represented 12% of the nation's 212 million drivers.  A greater percentage of male drivers (12%) than female drivers (8%) were stopped by police during 2011.  A higher percentage of black drivers (13%) than white (10%) and Hispanic (10%) drivers were stopped by police during 2011.  Stopped drivers reported speeding as the most common reason for being pulled over in 2011.  Approximately 80% of drivers pulled over by police in 2011 felt they had been stopped for a legitimate reason. In 2011, about 68% of black drivers believed police had a legitimate reason for stopping them compared to 84% of white and 74% of Hispanic drivers.  In 2011, about 3% of traffic stops led to a search of the driver, the vehicle, or both. Police were more likely to search male drivers (4%) than female drivers (2%).  A lower percentage of white drivers stopped by police in 2011 were searched (2%) than black (6%) or Hispanic (7%) drivers.

(WhiteHouse.gov)     Last October, President Obama told a gathering of police chiefs in Chicago about one way he had experienced racial bias before coming to the White House — while driving on the road.  "[M]ost of the time I got a ticket, I deserved it. I knew why I was pulled over. But there were times where I didn't," he said . "[T]here are a lot of African-Americans — not just me — who have that same kind of story of being pulled over. ...[T]he data shows that this is not an aberration. It doesn't mean each case is a problem. It means that when you aggregate all the cases and you look at it, you've got to say that there’s some racial bias in the system."  The fact that blacks get pulled over more than whites while on the road has long been a fact of American life. And on Wednesday evening, that reality became deadly when a Minnesota police officer shot and killed a black driver following a routine stop for a broken tail light, just one day after another fatal police shooting in Louisiana. (The violence continued in Dallas Thursday night, when snipers killed five police officers and injured more.)            1 of 58        Full Screen  Autoplay   Close                                                                                                                                          Skip Ad    ×            Protests in Minnesota and D.C. after a black man was fatally shot during a traffic stop       View Photos    Protesters gather in Falcon Heights, a St. Paul suburb, after the killing of 32-year-old Philando Castile.

Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post   Buy Photo           Wait 1 second to continue.          While Obama is correct in asserting that blacks are disproportionately pulled over, it's actually rather hard to assess how much of the disparity is driven by racial discrimination by police officers. Data on driver race in police records is sparse, and it's hard to capture what's happening on a national scale. But what research has been done reveals a few key trends:  1) A survey released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2014 found that nationwide, 13 percent of black drivers were stopped at least once by police during 2011, the last available data. For white drivers, that figure was 10 percent. Since this only captures whether drivers were stopped once, the disparity could be much bigger if black drivers were stopped more frequently than white drivers.     Though the BJS has not released more recent data, some individual states have these statistics, giving us reason to believe this pattern hasn’t gone away.  A study of Connecticut traffic stops in 2014 and 2015 — among the states with the most recent data — found that 14 percent of traffic stops targeted black drivers, despite them making up only 9 percent of the state’s population. Whites, on the other hand, made up 70 percent of the traffic stops, but about 80 percent of the population.  They also found the racial disparity was larger during the day than at night, when the officer can easily observe their race before turning on the sirens. The analogous statistic was not available for white drivers.  2) The racial disparity isn’t just limited to stops. Other police-driver contact — searches, tickets, arrests and license suspensions — show similar racial skews. A 2015 New York Times analysis found “wide racial differences in measure after measure of police conduct” in Ferguson, Mo., as well as in Connecticut, Illinois, North Carolina and Rhode Island, the states with the most comprehensive traffic stop data.  The Times analysis found that among the largest police departments in each of those four states, black drivers were between 1.5 and 5.2 times more likely to have their cars searched than white drivers.  These searches occur with the consent of the driver, so the officer doesn't need to meet any legal standard, like probable cause, to initiate one. Of course, he would need cause to pull over the driver in the first place, though minor violations like going a few miles over the speed limit or shifting lanes without a turn signal can offer that.       3) These disparities extend to other types of traffic stops. As far as tickets, a study of traffic stops in Bloomfield, N.J., released in April uncovered a high level of discrimination in ticketing. The majority-white town issued more than 80 percent of its tickets to black and Latino drivers from September 2014 to August 2015.  There are limits to what one can infer from one city, but same pattern was found across Connecticut. A 2015 analysis by the Hartford Courant found that black and Hispanic drivers who were stopped were 11 to 41 percent more likely to be ticketed than white offenders, depending on the offense committed.  And suspended licenses tell the same story. A report released earlier this year found that in California, black and Latino drivers are more likely than white drivers to be arrested for driving on a license suspended because of unpaid tickets, and minority neighborhoods have higher rates of license suspension than white ones.  4) While the data show conclusively that blacks have a disproportionate number of encounters with police at traffic stops, it hasn't shed much light on what portion of the disparity in all these metrics is driven by racial discrimination, and what portion is attributable to non-racial factors.  According to the National Institute of Justice , the research arm of the Department of Justice , other factors could include a difference in driving patterns — that is, if black drivers tend to just drive more miles than white drivers in certain jurisdictions, they could be stopped more often in those jurisdictions but have the same number of stops per mile. That would indicate against racial discrimination.  Further, black drivers could disproportionately drive in areas with a larger police presence, so they’re more likely to be pulled over than white drivers in less policed areas even without racial profiling by the police. Of course, if this is the case, it’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. Are blacks pulled over disproportionately because they drive through highly policed areas (not discrimination), or are police highly packed into those areas because there are more black drivers (discrimination)?  The NIJ also cites a possible difference in committing stoppable offenses. Though many  studies find no difference between whites and blacks in driving habits, there is some evidence that seat-belt use is lower among black drivers and passengers, which could prompt disproportionate stops and tickets.  5) The situation gets even more complicated with respect to vehicle searches. In this case, it's less likely that these other factors are at work. It's more likely either statistical discrimination (targeting black people because they're more likely to be carrying contraband) and outright prejudice (targeting black people because of animus toward them). The first would indicate that black people are searched more because they’re more likely to carry contraband, while the latter would say that black people are searched more often because the police have an antagonism toward them.  It’s an important difference — the former is a result of the police maximizing the number of offenders who are caught, whereas the latter is a result of the police seeking to punish black drivers. The former — what people usually mean when they say "racial profiling" — is ethically controversial for literally targeting people of certain skin colors, but sometimes defended as merely an efficient use of resources. The latter, not so much.  In simple terms, the impact of these two types of discrimination can be compared by looking at the rate people of each race are caught with contraband after they’ve been searched. If black drivers are consistently less likely to be caught with contraband  than whites, that means the police are spending their time searching less-suspicious blacks rather than more-suspicious whites, indicating prejudice.  A 2006 study of police searches in Florida found no evidence of prejudice, but evidence of statistical discrimination. More recent figures from 2014 and 2015 published by the New York Times show blacks who are searched are around 20 percent less likely to be carrying contraband than whites who are searched. While that certainly raises the odds that prejudice is playing a role, it can't be said for certain without a more careful study.  To some, however, the distinction between statistical discrimination and outright prejudice isn't so great. “Racial profiling sends the dehumanizing message to our citizens that they are judged by the color of their skin,” reads a fact sheet from the Department of Justice. It cited a “moral obligation” to prohibit the practice. In other words, the department finds both statistical discrimination and prejudice to be unethical.  But others argue that racial discrimination in law enforcement is a cost-effective way to fight crime, a way to apprehend the most guilty people with the fewest officer hours.  New York City, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg,  fought to defend its “stop, question, and frisk” policy in court. Officers disproportionately stopped blacks by a large margin under the policy; that is, the officers statistically discriminated against them. The city's defense in court focused on the policy's impact — how many weapons were confiscated, how much crime had fallen — and less so on the racial disparity. The policy was struck down as an illegal search in federal court in 2013. The city filed an appeal at first, but Mayor Bill DeBlasio withdrew it after he assumed office, ending the practice.  Ethics aside, this is where the research leaves us: Black drivers certainly get more face-time with traffic cops. But to what extent that reflects discrimination, and whether that discrimination is based in racial prejudice, is more of an open question.       The officer who fatally shot Philando Castile, 32, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Here's what you need to know about the traffic stop gone wrong, which ended up live-streamed on Facebook. (Editor's note: This video has been updated.)

And for what?  By  Andrew Ba Tran | July 6, 2015  Like Tweet  Email Print  More     More on Crime   Subscribe to Crime            Andrew Ba Tran Data Editor    The day before the Fourth of July produced the fifth-highest daily count of traffic stops last year in Connecticut.  This is according to traffic-stop data from the Office of Policy and Management, which is available because of a law compelling law enforcement agencies to electronically submit their traffic-stop information. Analysts have looked at the data and said they found significant racial disparities in some municipal departments and State Police troops.  But there is still more to discover in such a rich data set.  So TrendCT took a deeper look at the nearly 600,000 tickets issued in Connecticut between October 2013 and September 2014. We’ll be running several stories looking at various parts of the data. But today, we’re looking at when police most often pull drivers over — and for what.  When are you most likely to get pulled over?  We’ll start with the raw totals throughout the year.   It’s easier to see why some days have such a high tally, given their proximity to federal holidays. More people on the road means more opportunities for citations.  But a couple of days in May and September are among the 10 days with the most traffic stops. If anyone knows why those days in particular seem to yield a high number of tickets, let us know in the comments below.     Daily average number of tickets  Based on the first seven days, the last seven days, and the days between of each month.     First week  Middle weeks  Last week      6,333  6,453  6,764     CTData Collaborative   Those high-volume days, plus Memorial Day and Labor Day, make September and May the heaviest months of the year for drivers getting pulled over.  The colder months of February and December are periods when police stop drivers the least.  More stops occur on average during the last seven days of the month versus all other days. In fact, days during the last week of the month yield about 400 more traffic stops on average than days during the first week.  What are drivers most often ticketed for?  More than 25 percent of all drivers getting pulled over in Connecticut were speed-related, making it the top offense.  Interestingly, cell phone use while driving is the category with the fourth-most stops. It was introduced as a violation in 2005 . The state police pulled drivers the most for this violation (15,718 tickets), followed by Danbury and Wallingford (2,465 and 1,339 respectively).   The generic “Other” is the second-most-common reason drivers get stopped. “Other” could refer to things like violating exhaust emission inspection requirements and driving without a license.  But looking more closely, about 48 percent of all “Other” traffic stops were for “ failure to observe parkway or expressway restrictions “. This could be interpreted as a way for officers to ticket drivers for exceeding the speed limit, but without the higher fines and consequences of a speeding ticket.

Here are some ideas to avoid getting pulled over in the first place.   1. Drive the Speed Limit. I know this is obvious, but if you aren’t running late, it might be something to seriously consider.  An additional benefit of following the speed limit (versus speeding) is an increase in gas mileage.  That’s a win-win reason.  2. Middle of the Pack. Need to speed? Find a group of cars going the speed you want and hang out in the middle.  The first car is likely to trigger a cop radar, and the last car is likely to get pulled over first.  Hanging out in the middle is a safer placer to be if you need to speed.  3. Follow a Speeder. Put some distance between you and the speeder and let him trigger the radar.  The distance allows you enough time to slow down when the cop pulls out.     4. Drive a decent car. Speaking from personal experience, if you’re driving a beat-up car with the paint peeling off – cops will find a reason to pull you over.  If you’re driving a decent car that blends in, you won’t draw extra attention to yourself.  5. Relax. Aggressive driving will only draw extra attention to yourself.  So even if some jerk cuts you off or drives 10 under the speed limit, take a deep breath and relax.  When you can safely get around the person, remind yourself to relax and avoid the old, “I’m going to teach him a lesson” philosophy.  6. Pay Attention. If you commute the same way to work every day, start paying attention.  Notice where the cops sit, or where there are turnouts for cops to hide.  Make note of them and slow down accordingly.  7. Leave on time. The biggest reason for speeding is that you are late .  Leave on time, and enjoy your ride to your destination without the anxiety, stress, and pressure to speed.   8. Don’t drive. This is a very great way to avoid getting pulled over.  By taking the bus or riding your bike, you’re helping the environment, saving money on gas, reducing traffic problems, and you’re avoiding potential traffic violations. Another win-win reason.  9. Hang Up. Or get a hands-free device.  If you’re the only one on your cell phone in a pack of speeding vehicles, you just increased your chances of getting pulled over.  10. Keep your registration updated. And put the sticker on!  Don’t let yourself get pulled over because you’re too lazy to put the little sticker on your car.  You’ll feel like a fool when the cop walks up to your car and you have the stickers sitting next to you.  That reason also comes from personal experience.  11. You’re not in the clear. Just because you see someone else pulled over doesn’t mean that you’re in the clear.  Speed traps often come in pairs – it’s part of the setup.  So give yourself a few miles before speeding up again.  12. Easy on the Holidays. Whether it’s Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Labor Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, or any of the other number of holidays, take it easy.  Cops working on holidays are probably not too happy about it.  They’ll be looking for people to punish.  And you don’t want that to be you.  13. Watch your back. While your scanning the road in front of you in search for cops, don’t forget to look back.  You don’t want to be driving for miles with a cop behind you (and lights on).  14. Flashed. If you just got flashed (someone’s brights flashed at you) and you didn’t have your brights on, the driver might be warning you about a speed trap they just passed.  Don’t risk it.  Slow down and play it safe.  The next time you pass a speed trap, pass the favor on.  15. Volunteer. At your local police department.  Get to know the officers, let them know what your car looks like, and enjoy the advantages of your new friends.  Plus you’ll be helping at your community – that will balance out that karma for your speeding and aggressive driving.  16. Seatbelt. Seat belts save lives, and in most places it’s against the law to not wear one.  So be smart – buckling up could save your life and help you avoid getting pulled over.  Another win-win reason.    17. Follow the Law. The BEST way to avoid getting pulled over is to follow the law, which I encourage.  Keep yourself and the rest of us safe on the road by following those annoying laws.  Thank You!

For those of us who have avoided run-ins with law while driving, and have not accrued a mountain of traffic tickets, people often say, “Geez you’re lucky you never get pulled over, I get nailed by the police all the time!”   Well sadly, for all intensive purposes, there is no such thing as luck. Luck is a fanciful idea, similar to hopes, dreams, and wishes. There is no guarantee that luck will be on your side, that your hopes will be met, dreams achieved, or wishes granted. We live in a cold harsh world, which contrary to what many may believe, is filled with absolute certainties. With that in mind, it’s best if we understand that what people refer to as “luck”, is really nothing more than the residue of design. How you design something entirely creates the chance of all possible outcomes.  So when driving, have you considered the residue of your designs? Do you know the things that drastically increase your chance of being pulled over? Because next time you breeze through a red light, coast through a stop sign, or are speeding on your way home and notice a police cruiser that has not turned on its lights to chase you down, that is not attributed to luck. The police officer either didn’t see you, or had something more important to do. There is no luck present in that scenario, if they did notice you and had the time, no doubt they would have pulled you over. So without further ado, lets discuss what you should be aware of when driving to avoid being pulled over.  Driving Over The Speed Limit  Nothing will catch a police officer’s attention more than speeding, and more than that, excessive speeding. With speed cameras often placed around cities and at certain intersections, it’s even more important not to speed because nowadays, a police officer doesn’t even need to be in site for you to receive a speeding ticket.  Illegal Use Of A Phone  Many states currently have anti-texting laws in place, and rightly so. Doing anything but pay attention while you are driving does nothing more than distract you, and focus is certainly required while behind the wheel. But an officer can see you holding your phone or you looking into your lap for a long period of time and assume you are texting or simply fiddling with your phone. Remember, anti-texting laws don’t simply mean you are physically texting. You could be reading a text, Facebook updates, emails, or anything else and would fall under these laws. People are still allowed to talk on their phones, but even that is discouraged. So unless you are at a stop light, keep your phone away. There’s no need to tempt police.  Hazardous Driving  Peeling out at stop lights, swerving, and overall just erratic driving is a huge red flag for police officers. They can assume you are racing, drunk, under the influence of drugs, and any other number of things. And you have to remember that police don’t have to “know” you are racing, drunk, or driving on drugs. They just have to have reason to believe that, and if you’re all over the place on the road driving like Evel Knievel, they have all the right to believe just that.  Equipment Violations  There are reasons we have the laws in place that we do. Headlights allow you to see at night, as well as allow others to see you. Turn signals and brake lights help to alert other drivers of your intentions. A crack in your windshield obstructs your vision. Even overly tinted windows reduce visibility, which is a danger when driving. Bumpers are securely attached to protect you and other drivers in the event of an accident. Rear view mirrors help so you know what is going on around you. In the end, there are numerous reasons for the laws we have in place for properly functioning vehicle equipment, and if any of those seem to be damaged or improperly working, a police officer will pull you over.  Tailgating  The law of the road is for every 10mph you are traveling, you are to provide 1 car length, roughly 15 ft, between you and the vehicle in front of you. Oddly, this seems excessive when you imagine what the highway looks like during rush hour. But if you do not follow this, and follow the vehicle in front of you too closely, you can be pulled over and ticketed. Now, considering there is no real way to determine the exact footage between two vehicles moving, it’s up to the officers discretion. But understand, if you’re traveling 45mph and are around 2 car lengths behind the vehicle in front of you, this is noticeable and knowing the exact footage doesn’t matter for an officer to pull you over.  Improper Lane Changes  When you switch lanes there are a few things to keep in mind. 1. Never change lanes traveling through an intersection. 2. Never change lanes over solid colors road lines. 3. You need to provide 3 seconds of warning, meaning the use of your blinker, before switching lanes to allow other drivers to account for your vehicle moving over. If you go against any of those three points, an officer will notice immediately and pull you over.  Driving Too Slowly  Most people are in a rush to get where they are going. So it is extremely suspicious when an officer sees a vehicle driving too far below the speed limit. They can assume something is wrong, you’re drunk or high, and any other number of possible problems. It is also illegal to travel too slow on some roads, mainly the highway. If you’re in the left lane in a 65 mph area, and are only going 45 mph, you are putting other drivers at risk for driving too slowly. The extra 20 mph may not be accounted for when a vehicle is approaching or changing lanes and can cause driver to become erratic due to being impatient. It’s an odd law, because you would think the slower the safer, but on certain roadways this is not the case.  Using The Left Lane Without Having To Pass  You shouldn’t continually use the left lane unless you are passing other vehicles. In fact, that is the only reason there left lanes, which are meant to be used in passing. What it has turned into is a lane for those that want to go faster, but that was not its purpose. Unless you have a turn coming up, or are passing a person in the right lane, stay in the right lane. The left lane is closest to the left lane of the oncoming direction, and to keep everyone safer, those lanes are intended to stay open unless needed. If you are all alone on the road, and have been driving in the left lane for a while, albeit even going the speed limit, it gives police officers a reason to at least take note of you. And when trying to avoid being pulled over all together, being noticed for any reason is unwanted.  Failure To Wear A Seatbelt  Click it or ticket! We’ve all heard that slogan before and the bark of it is much better than the bite. There is no worse feeling than being pulled over, and when asked if you know why you were pulled over, while not knowing, the police officer mentions they noticed you didn’t have your seatbelt on. The fine associated with this is often steep as well. So to avoid being given a ticket because you weren’t protecting yourself, do yourself a favor. Wear your seatbelt, protect yourself, and protect your hard earned cash as well. It takes 4 seconds to put your seatbelt on, which is better than brain damage or a $160 ticket.  Questionable Activities  If you are driving around, there could be many things going on in your car which to an outsider may look much different. Smoking a cigarette may look like a joint of marijuana, drinking a bottled soda may look like a beer. Asking your kid to get something out of the backseat may look like your allowing your child to romp all over the vehicle without wearing a seatbelt. Point being, there are a number of things to be self-aware of, and though you will certainly feel it’s not fair you were pulled over, from the police officers perspective, it was a vastly different story.

What Are the Odds of Getting Pulled Over By the Cops? Published on May 3, 2016 Brian Wallace, Infographic Expert Follow Following Unfollow Brian Wallace, Infographic Expert Sign in to follow this author Founder, NowSourcing | Google Board Member | 2,000+ Infographics Created | Featured: NYT, Forbes, Entrepreneur, Mashable Did you know your odds of getting pulled over by the police are different according to your race and gender? Hispanic and black drivers are more likely than their white counterparts to be searched and ticketed when they are pulled over. According to the statistics, though, force is not used as often as you might think.  Police use force in traffic stops 1.2% of the time. That’s a lot less than you might think because of constant news stories about excessive force. Even drivers upon whom force was used typically think it was necessary in hindsight, according to survey results.  The prison population is another story, though. Whereas your odds of being pulled over vary according to your race by 4 or 5 percentage points, blacks and Hispanics are considerably more likely than their white counterparts to spend time in prison.
