There are almost as many ways of choosing lottery numbers as there are chances of winning it.  With a must-win £24.7 million jackpot up for grabs this week , picking the right numbers could change your life.  However, the first thing to realise is that the odds are stacked against you.  The chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 (or approximately 1 in 14 million), while there is a 1 in 2,330,636 chance of getting five numbers plus the bonus ball.  There is a one in 55,000 chance of five of your numbers being selected by the lottery machine.  To win the Euromillions jackpot there is a one in 116.5 million of all your numbers being drawn.       Changes to the National Lottery        T he chance winning any of the lottery prizes, however small,  is approximately 54 to 1. So an average of one million people per draw will likely win a prize.  But is there a way of narrowing these odds? Let's take a look at some of the options:  Picking the most commonly drawn numbers  One approach would be to choose the numbers that come up most often. At the moment the most frequently drawn ball is the number 44 .  Since the National Lottery began in 1994, it has been drawn 253 times.  The other most common numbers are:   38 – 251 times  40 – 249 times  23 – 248 times  39 – 246 times  33 – 245 times   However, their frequency of appearance is no indication that they will be drawn together. In fact, the chance of these numbers cropping up in a winning combination is the same as any other set of six.           1. Choosing the birthdays of family or friends  F or those who use birthdays, five of the most commonly drawn numbers are more than 31, meaning they are not likely to have picked them.  Sticking to birthdays certainly limits the range of numbers you can choose and this is a common system, so more people are likely to pick those numbers, meaning you may have to share your prize.                 And the winner is...   Credit: PA          2. Picking overdue numbers  A nother approach that is commonly used is to look for numbers that have not come up in a while.  Human intuition tells us that if something has not happened in a while, then it is probably overdue.  Currently the most overdue number is 48 – it has not been picked in nearly 81 days. Similarly, the numbers 23 and 46 last appeared 77 days ago.  The 21 ball came up 63 days ago while number 14 was selected 60 days ago and number 2 emerged 56 days ago.  The least picked numbers are 20, 13, 21, 41, 16, and 37.  However, while the concept that things which are overdue will eventually happen makes sense, it does not mean they will when it comes to the National Lottery .                 In it to win it   Credit: Paul Grover          D r John Haigh, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Sussex who has written a paper on the statistics underlying the National Lottery, said: “Just because a number has not come up for a while does not mean it will in the next draw.  “Just as you flip a coin, if you get five heads in a row, it does not mean the next time it is more likely to be tails. The odds are still 50/50.           “So with the lottery, they remain one in 14 million.”  3. Lucky numbers  L ike birthdays, this is a common approach, steeped more in superstition than any real logic. But some people are naturally drawn to certain numbers in the same way they may have a favourite colour.  Interestingly the most commonly chosen numbers are those that end in a 7 according to work done by experimental physicist Jonathan Clarke .  The key here is having enough lucky numbers to fill an entire lottery ticket – if you have to borrow numbers from someone else then they are not really lucky any more are they?  And if you win, are you going to share the jackpot with them?  4. Picking previous winning numbers  Analysis of the Swiss lottery revealed has revealed a surprising trend – people tend to choose their numbers based on the previous week’s winning numbers.  Others were found to use the jackpot numbers from two weeks before and some further back than that.  Does this make any difference? Sadly, Dr Haigh tells us the odds remain the same. But it does make picking the numbers easier.  5. Pick the best-ever performing ticket  If you had selected the ticket 03 06 13 23 27 49 in every draw since the National Lottery started you would have won £2,017,671 according to analyst Richard Lloyd .  He has found that this ticket has been the best performing in the history of the lottery so far in terms of the number of prize winning matches.           H owever, the odds of that combination coming up again remain the same.  6. The appliance of science  There is a multitude of reading material giving advice about how win the lottery.  For upwards of £20 of your hard -earned money, you too can learn how to use complicated maths or systems like wheeling to pick your numbers.  Wheeling, which is one of the most popular systems, involves buying multiple tickets and using seven numbers rather six across those, for example.  Prediction software is also widely available on the internet with accompanying claims of great accuracy.  In fact, none of these have ever been proven to be effective and experts say those that with enough people using these systems, simple statistics says some people will win using them.  Indeed, perhaps the only people who really win from these approaches are the people who pocket the cash being paid for the books in the first place.  7. The random selection  Surprisingly, this is seen as the best approach by experts.  Not because it increases your chance of winning, but because it increases your chance of winning MORE.  By selecting numbers that use systems employed by others, it is more likely that other people will also have picked those numbers too.  If your numbers were to win the jackpot, then you would have to share more of your prize with those other people.  Randomly plucking numbers means the combination is least likely to have been selected by someone else.  “If you pick the least popular numbers and win, then you will probably share your jackpot with fewer people,” explains Dr Haigh.           8. Try the aesthetic approach  I n the ninth ever draw of the National Lottery in 1995, there were a record breaking 133 winners who shared the £16 million jackpot.  Analysis of the numbers revealed an interesting phenomenon – all of the numbers were contained within the three inside columns of the playing slip at the time.  There were also no two numbers on the same row nor adjacent to each other. It appears the numbers were selected randomly for the way they looked on the slip.  Dr Haigh says: “This is a really lazy way of choosing numbers as it is an easy thing to do.  “People do like to make pretty patterns on their playing slip.  “Research on the Swiss lottery has also shown that a lot of people select numbers that go diagonally across or down the slip, for example.”  However, Dr Haigh has some final words of wisdom that may help you decide which of these methods to use.  He says: “Whatever method you chose, the chances of your six numbers coming up remain the same. It is ridiculous to think otherwise.”  But remember, if any of these tips actually do result in a jackpot win, I’m more than happy to share some of the prize.

Lustig Talent Enterprises        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Saturday's Powerball drawing is a staggering $320 million. With such an enormous sum at stake, who better to turn to then Richard Lustig  seven-time lottery grand prize winner and author of "Learn How To Increase Your Chances of Winning The Lottery"  for tips on how to win.  Lustig says he's been playing the lottery for about 25 years. He claims to play every day, but in the first few years, he says he was not winning very much.    So Lustig decided to come up with a method, which he claims has helped him win seven grand prizes, including his last jackpot of $98,000 two-and-a-half years ago.  $320M jackpot up for grabs in Saturday's Powerball  Powerball to the people  Trekking to try hand at Powerball   Lustig says a guaranteed way to increase your chances of winning the lottery is simply by picking your own numbers versus using the "quick-pick" ticket option.  "It doesn't matter how you pick your numbers, once you pick your set of numbers, research them to know if it's a good set of numbers and stick with them. There's no magic method to picking your numbers, I get emails every day asking. One number doesn't win the jackpot, a set of numbers does," says Lustig.    "The lazy way out is to buy quick-picks. The computer picks out the numbers. Don't play quick-picks. Quick-picks are the worst thing you can do, you are playing with the worst odds," he says.  Lustig believes that what matters is whether the set of numbers people pick is a good one or not. To know this out however, one has to research the numbers in a method only taught in his book, which, as we found out, he guards very closely ... unless you buy the book.  "The research is not that easy, it takes some time. Anything in life that's worth having takes time," says Lustig.  Another important part of playing the lottery, Lustig cautions, is setting a budget of how much you can afford on tickets.    "Don't get lottery fever- don't use your grocery money, or your rent money. Remember one thing, if there is one winner on Saturday night, there will be millions of losers, don't be that person Sunday morning worrying about how you can pay back the money you spent," says Lustig.  One secret Lustig will share is that he believes picking the same numbers regularly, even if you are losing, gives you more edge in the next drawing.    Lustig says he will absolutely be playing Saturday's Powerball. But when asked what numbers he'll be playing, he wouldn't share.  "Not telling. Good try though," said Lustig.   © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

So how do you increase your chances of winning? Well, usually, by chance. The more tickets you purchase for a specific drawing, the better your chances. But there are a few people who believe there's more to it than that.         Steps    Method  1   Implement Strategies           1   Purchase more than one ticket. The more tickets purchased will increase your odds of winning.  Consider that an average state lottery has jackpot odds of about 100,000,000 to 1 -- it's often even worse: The multi-state "Powerball" lottery has jackpot odds of about 185,000,000 to 1. Holding fifty tickets only would improve your odds to 100,000,000 to 50.            2   Join a lottery pool. Get a group together at your office, school, church, activity center or any place where others are willing to share a winning ticket.  The payout that you receive will be less because you will be sharing it, but your chances of winning are slightly increased.           3   Understand that the other tickets do not affect your tickets in most lotteries.   Many people erroneously think that they have better chances of winning when fewer people play, but this is not true unless you are entering a raffle wherein a winning ticket is pulled from all the entries.  The odds of the lottery's random numbers matching your ticket's numbers are not affected by the number of people who have tickets. Think of it this way: If only one person bought just one ticket for the lottery is that person guaranteed to win? No.  However, the fewer people who play, the lower the odds of multiple winners are.           4   Play less often, but buy more. This increases your chances for that specific play.  This strategy does not affect your odds of winning in your lifetime but can affect what jackpot you win, if you win.  Instead of buying a ticket every week save up the money you would spend and use it to buy tickets when the jackpot reaches large amounts. This maximizes the return without increasing your financial risk.  You don't need to use the same numbers every time - it does not increase your odds of winning. Previous draws have no effect on future draws - each draw is a clean slate - so feel free to change your numbers each time.  People who play the same numbers every week can become 'addicted' to the lottery over fears that their usual numbers will come up if they do not buy a ticket. Using different numbers each week can help you stay in control of your gambling, and does not affect your odds of winning.  In lotteries where a winner is drawn from a raffle, you increase your odds of winning by playing the week after a huge jackpot - as typically fewer people play the lottery after a big cash prize has been won.           5   Check and double-check your tickets. Sometimes, there are several ways to win. Make sure not to assume you lost and thoroughly look over your tickets.         6   Quit while you're ahead. Getting a series of winners will only add up if you cease buying.  Set a budget and stick with it. If possible, use the lottery money you've won to purchase future tickets. That way, you dip less frequently into your main income.                 Method  2   Decide on Quick Picks vs Self Picks          1   Weigh your odds. The jury is still out. More people win via quick picks (in Powerball)-- but more people use quick picks . Statistically, the odds are the same that any combination of numbers will be picked. So, it doesn’t matter if you choose lucky numbers or let the machine choose for you. [1]   Though it may seem illogical, 1-2-3-4-5-6 is just as likely as a random selection of 6 numbers.  The only drawback of self picks is that humans are all generally programmed the same. That is, your favorite numbers are probably someone else's favorite numbers. So, if you win on 7-14-21-28-35-42, you may have to share.  Richard Lustig, 7-time lottery winner, highly advises against quick picks. [2] He argues that picking your own numbers keeps you from getting combinations of recent winners (so long as you've done your research!), thus increasing your chances. [3] .  If you are playing your state's lottery, don't bother checking to see if old winning numbers are available online. Just because a number recently came up, that doesn't alter the odds of it coming up again. Today's randomly selected numbers aren't affected by any other day's randomly selected number.              Method  3   Buy Scratchcards          1   Invest in smaller payouts. Smaller reward — more likely to win? Maybe. Mohan Srivastava, a statistician living in Toronto, says he broke the code. His story certainly involves a lot of time for a rather small payout. [4]   A typical scratchcard has odds between 1:5 and 1:2.5. Consider this when picking out your scratchers.  Ask the clerk which ones have been bought the most and returned the most winners. Pick a game that has seen mostly losses -- that way, a win should be coming up. If the odds are 1:5, purchasing 5 cards should allot you 1 winner.

Define to yourself what you mean by 'win'. If you wish to win the jackpot only, then your chances are as given above -- i.e. 'n' tickets purchased will give you 'n' more chances of winning. However, if there are smaller prizes (e.g. three numbers out of six as in UK Lotto), then you should structure your entry to ensure that no three numbers are repeated in any selection on any of your tickets. 6C3=10 -- i.e. there are ten combinations of three from 6 on one ticket. If you purchase ten tickets, and ensure no three numbers repeat on any, your chances of winning a small prize increase from 10 to 60; however, your chances of winning the jackpot remain unaltered (improving by a factor of ten for ten tickets).  If the jackpot is very large, you may wish to contact a lawyer to help you redeem your ticket.  If you join an office pool, make sure that you receive a photocopy of all the tickets purchased from the person buying the tickets. Be sure that this person is trustworthy. Be sure to check your photocopies against the published winning numbers.  Get your winning ticket to the claims center as quick as possible. If you mail your ticket do it via certified and insured mail. Better yet, if possible, hand deliver your winning ticket to the claims center.  If you're in the UK, you need to be at least 16 to play the National Lottery and claim any prizes.       Warnings    Never spend more than you can afford on the lottery, it will only leave you worse off.  If you're in the United States, you need to be at least 18 or older to play the lottery and claim your prize.

What would you buy if you had millions of dollars? And what if you could have millions of dollars by just spending a couple dollars? That's the lure of the lottery … A lottery is a gambling game that's used to raise money. At its most basic level, a lottery involves paying a small amount of money — to purchase a lottery ticket, for example — for the chance to win a prize, such as a large sum of money . Lotteries don't involve skill. Since lotteries are determined purely by chance, all you need to be is lucky ...VERY lucky! Today, there are many different types of lotteries: from simple “50/50" drawings at local events (the winner gets 50% of the proceeds from tickets sold) to multi-state lotteries with jackpots of several million dollars. So what are your odds of winning the jackpot ? As it turns out, they're not so good. Although the exact odds depend upon many factors, let's look at a couple of examples. In a lottery in which you pick 6 numbers from a possible pool of 49 numbers, your chances of winning the jackpot (correctly choosing all 6 numbers drawn) are 1 in 13,983,816. That's 1 shot in almost 14 million. If you were to buy one lottery ticket each week in such a scenario, you could expect to win once every 269,000 years. Unfortunately, many lotteries have even worse odds than the scenario just described. For example, the popular Mega Millions multi-state lottery has odds of approximately 1 in 175,711,536. That's right — 1 in almost 176 million! If the odds are so bad, why do so many people spend money on lottery tickets? That's a great question. For most, it appears to be the entertainment factor of taking a chance and indulging the fantasy of getting rich quickly. So should you spend money on lottery tickets? There are, after all, people who win big money. In 2007, two people split a $390 million Mega Millions jackpot , the world's largest jackpot ever. However, the odds against that happening to you are astronomical…literally. According to figures from the National Weather Service, you're over 20,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning at some point in your lifetime than you are to win the Mega Millions jackpot . An alternative to spending money on lottery tickets is investing that money. For example, if you would normally spend $150 each year on lottery tickets, consider putting that money instead in an investment that yields an 8% return . Over the course of 40 years, that yearly investment could be worth more than $38,000. Some might consider that a lottery  win in itself!

I learned that the chances of winning a lottery in which you must pick six numbers out of 49 is 1 in 13,989,816.  I also learned that you are 20,000 times more likely to get struck by lightning in some point in your life than winning the Mega Millions jackpot.  Have you ever won the lottery?  I learned that if you were to buy 1 lottery ticket each week you could expect to win every 269,000 years.  I really liked this wonder.

We haven't won any lotteries, but we like hearing stories about people who do!  We like hearing how some people who win large sums of money use their winnings to make the world a better place and help others.  Those are our favorite kinds of lottery stories!  :-)   Reply  cancel           the duke  Sep 20, 2011    We like interesting facts about how the lottery isn't so much a skill but more of luck.  We learned that it's 176,000,000 of a chance of winning.    That's crazy and amazing!  The chances of winning is very small. I don't think I will play.

Tweet This     on Saturday night, someone could win the largest Powerball lottery ever, $700 million    Every time you buy a quick pick, you get a different set of numbers; therefore, your odds are always going to be at their worst in that particular game,      I defy you to find anyone who has never fantasized about winning the lottery. The house! The travel! The help for loved ones and favorite charities! Someone to deliver a single, perfect piece of chocolate to your door every day! (OK, maybe that's just me.)  While most of us will never see that kind of money dumped in our laps, a select few lottery winners do actually get to realize their fantasy—and  on Saturday night, someone could win the largest Powerball lottery ever, $700 million .         Richard Lustig of Orlando, FL, has won seven lottery grand prizes through a system he developed.        One of the “luckiest” people in the nation is Richard Lustig, author of Learn How To Increase Your Chances of Winning the Lottery , who has won seven lottery grand prizes and perfected his strategy though trial and error. “When the lottery came to Florida, I was like everybody else: ‘Wow, buy lottery tickets, win a lot of money, retire, buy a big fancy yacht, whatever, blah, blah, blah,’” he said. “Like everybody else, I was running out and buying haphazardly, buying quick picks, I mean buying tickets with no plan, or no method, or whatever. Like everybody else, I was losing all the time.”  Then Lustig realized there had to be a way to increase his chances. Every time something worked, he’d write it down. Eventually, he had a “formula” that worked for him and others. His main tips--which don't all follow strict mathematical logic, and have been discounted by some as nonsense --for those playing lotteries are below:    Don’t use the “quick-pick” numbers generated from the store’s computer. Even though it seems like every number has an equal amount of “luck,” certain number sets are better than others. “  Every time you buy a quick pick, you get a different set of numbers; therefore, your odds are always going to be at their worst in that particular game, whatever game you're playing. In this case, the hype, of course, is all about the Powerball right now,” Lustig says.  Go beyond the birthdays. The spread is important—if you always choose birth month and dates, like most people do, you’re relegating yourself to less than half the numbers available, 1 through 31. Equally important about including bigger numbers: “If you pick your own numbers and only play birthdays and anniversaries, you’re splitting the pot with 20-40 people. If you spread the numbers out across the whole track, you’ll either be the only winner or will split it with only one or two people,” Lustig says.  Don’t change the numbers. Once you’ve determined which numbers are “good,” (he recommends a specific way to find these in his book) don’t switch them, play them every time. If you buy more than one card, use a different set of numbers. “Remember, a set of numbers wins the grand prize, not individual numbers,” Lustig says. He says it’s OK to repeat a number or two, but be sure each group of numbers is mostly different so you increase your odds. (Though, if you're looking at this in a solid math sense, in a fair lottery, every number has the same probability of being drawn.)  Play consistently. “Never miss a drawing in the game you’re playing. Every Saturday, every Wednesday, every week,” Lustig says.  Understand the odds, but know your limits : If you play 100 cards, you’ll have a better chance than if you pay just 10—but only play what you can afford to lose. It’s not a regular investment, as in an IRA or a stock. “One of the things that I preach to people all the time is budget, budget, budget,” Lustig says. “Set a budget of what you're going to spend. Do not get caught up in what's called lottery fever. Don't spend grocery money. Don't spend rent money. Figure out what you can afford to spend. Don't worry about how much Joe Blow down the street is spending. … Figure out what your budget is, what you can comfortably afford to spend, and stay within that budget."    Richer In 7 Hours: An eBook From Forbes   Cut your expenses, boost your net worth and secure your financial future in a day.   Does it really pay to play?  Of course, plenty of financial professionals say it's never worth it to play the lottery. Even though there's a lot to be gained, in general, playing Powerball is still a bad decision because you never get the full jackpot, and chances are  you'll be splitting it, says Paul Dreyer, a mathematician for the RAND Corporation (who, for the record, fully disagrees with the logic of Lustig's method).

        Photo: Martin Barraud/Getty Images       By  Kimberly Amadeo     Updated November 07, 2017     The biggest lottery jackpot ever was $1.6 billion on January 13, 2016. Authorities announced three winning Powerball tickets in California, Tennessee, and Florida. That beats the Mega Millions on March 31, 2012. Three winners split a $656 million jackpot. The winning tickets were sold in Illinois, Maryland, and Kansas. Those states don't have to reveal the names of the winners. The prior largest Powerball payout was close behind, at $590.5 million.           Gloria C. Mackenzie, an 84-year old Floridian, won on June 5, 2013. The odds of winning either the Powerball or Mega Millions were roughly the same: 175 million to one . Despite those odds, one-third of Americans believe that winning the lottery is the only way they will ever retire. But how likely is it? Here's a humorous look comparing the odds of winning the lottery to some other lucky and unlucky events. That's followed by strategies that are more likely to win you a bountiful retirement . Things That Are More Likely Than Winning the Lottery If you believe in the odds of winning the lottery, then you should never fly or drive. That because you are more apt to be killed in a plane crash, where the odds are 25 million to one, and far more likely to die in a car accident, where the odds are only 5,000 to one. Similarly, you should start sleeping on the floor and taking showers. That's because the odds of being killed by falling out of bed are 2 million to one, while the odds of drowning while taking a bath are 840,000 to one.     But don't think you can improve your chances by avoiding cleanliness altogether. The odds of dying from a flesh-eating bacteria are only 1 million to one. Maybe you'll have better luck outside. Not! The odds of being killed by lightning are 2 million to one while being mauled to death by a dog are 700,000 to one.           Bring your anti-venom kit, because you are even more likely to die from a snake bite or bee sting, where the odds are 100,000 to one. If these statistics have you feeling a little paranoid, cheer up. Many good things are also more likely than winning the lottery. For example, the odds of becoming a movie star are only 1.5 million to one, while the odds of getting a royal flush in the first hand of poker are just 649,740 to one. Even better (guys), the odds of dating a supermodel are a measly 88,000 to one. To put it all into perspective, consider this. Scientists have calculated that there is just a 300 to one chance that asteroid 2004 MN4 will strike the Earth on April 13, 2029. The asteroid is about a quarter mile (400 meters) wide. That is larger than the asteroid that carved out Meteor Crater in Arizona, and the one that flattened thousands of square miles of forest in Siberia in 1908. Things You No Longer Have to Worry About OK, time for a little cheering up again. Many bad things are less likely than winning the lottery. For example, it's safe to go back into the water. The odds of dying from a shark attack are 300 million to one, only half as likely as winning the lottery. Swimming with the sharks is much safer than petting a dog, driving your car, or sleeping in your bed.            How to Improve Your Odds If you've read all these statistics, and still want to play the lottery, here are some ways to improve your chances. First, use the computer-generated numbers, they tend to be the luckiest. That's because there is less chance of someone else picking a duplicate number. Furthermore, only 30 percent of the winning numbers were the players' "lucky" numbers. Whatever you do, don't pick "lucky" seven, 11, or a birthday. You can be sure that someone else will have also picked those numbers. Second, be sure to play the $1 million or $2 million second prize in the Powerball. There, you only have to match five of the six numbers. Those odds are one out of 5 million. You get even better odds if you just play in the state lotteries instead of the national one. How to Improve Your Chances of Attaining Retirement Perhaps you are one of those who consider the lottery their best chance of retiring.  Well, consider this comparison instead. Let's say you currently buy a $2 lottery ticket every week for the next 17 years (before the 300 to one chance the asteroid hits Earth). There is little likelihood, based on the odds, that you would have won. If you instead invested that $2 a week in securities and got a 5 percent return, you would have accumulated $2,926. Doesn't sound like much, does it? Let's say you invested $2 a day instead. You would wind up with $20,5361 by 2029. Your return will probably be greater than that. Before the 2008 financial crisis , the average stock market return was 10 percent a year. If you get that return over the next 17 years, then your $2 a day would become $33,287. True, that's not enough to retire on. But what if you increased it to $5 a day. You'd wind up with $83,220. Or doubled that, and invested $10 a day, you'd get $166,436. Now you're talking. The point is that you do have better odds for a successful retirement if you plan for it than by playing the lottery. You don't have to depend on fate, chance or luck. You can take matters into your own hands, starting today.

Common-Sense Lottery-Winning Tips        Share       Flip       Pin       Email        By  Sandra Grauschopf     Updated March 18, 2018      If you read books or search the internet for how to win the lottery, you'll find a lot of tips that don't work. Lottery frequency schemes (every number has an equal chance of winning, no matter how recently it was drawn), software that's supposed to be better at picking numbers, and other forms of wishful thinking abound. There is no way to predict the numbers that will come up in the lottery. The drawings are completely random, so the best you can do is try to pick unusual numbers so you won't have to split in case there's a tie. That doesn't mean that there's no way of increasing your odds of winning, though. Here are some common-sense tips that really will help you win the lottery .      01   Improve Your Chances of Winning the Lottery by Playing the Right Games           •••  Different Lottery Games Have Different Odds and Payouts. Choose Wisely.
        Image (c) Scott Olson / Getty Images      People talk about winning the lottery as if it were just one game. But every state has a selection of lottery games with different odds of winning. Read the odds before you spend your money to ensure you're maximizing your chances of winning. Remember that lottery games like Powerball and MegaMillions are national lotteries, so they have a much broader entry pool. State lotteries, where players have to physically be in that state to buy a ticket, usually have better odds. And don't write off scratch-off games, which might have smaller prizes but higher chances of winning overall.               02   Get More Entries Without Spending More Money with Lottery Pools           •••  A Lottery Pool Can Give You Better Chances of Winning for the Same Price.
        Image (c) Achim Sass / Getty Images      The easiest way to boost your odds of winning lotteries is simply to buy more tickets. But of course, that costs money, and even if you invest a lot of money in tickets, your odds of winning are still poor. But lottery pools give you the opportunity to improve your odds without spending more money. Consider join your office lottery pool or starting one of your own to get better chances of winning without breaking your budget.               03   Don't Miss a Lottery Win: Double-Check Your Numbers!           •••  Double-Check Your Lottery Tickets So You Don't Miss a Win.
        Saturated / Getty Images      Imagine actually winning a big jackpot... but missing out on your money because you forgot to double-check your numbers. It happens more often than you think. For example, one MegaMillions lottery ticket worth nearly $300,000 went unclaimed. Don't let that happen to you. When you buy a lottery ticket, keep it somewhere where you can find it again easily. Jot down the drawing date and time in your calendar if you're afraid you might forget it. Check the numbers against your ticket, and double-check them, just to be sure. Also, make sure that you are looking at the numbers for the correct date. Some people like to have convenience store clerks verify their tickets to be sure they don't make a mistake while checking their numbers. If you decide to do this, make sure you follow the tips below to avoid a scam. If you miss your lottery announcement, check out this state-by-state listing of winning lottery results .               04  Multiply Your Chances of Winning the Lottery with Second-Chance Games          •••  Don't Pass Up Another Chance to Win the Lottery.
        Image (c) Tetra Images / Getty Images      OK, so your numbers didn't come up in the drawing. That means it's time to toss your lottery ticket, right? Wrong! On June 8, 2010, an About.com Sweepstakes Forum member going by the name KentuckyBell reported a big lottery win. But she didn't win because of the numbers she played when she bought the ticket, but because she entered the second-chance game in the Kentucky Lottery. Her name was randomly drawn as the winner, and she took home $120,610.70 after taxes. So don't give up just because you didn't win the first time. If your lottery game includes a second-chance drawing, entering could be your ticket to winning.      05  Someone Else's Loss Might Be Your Lottery Ticket Win          •••  Keeping Your Eyes Open Could Score You a Lottery Win.
        Image (c) Image Source / Getty Images      A lot of people throw out their lottery tickets after a drawing, but that doesn't mean that the tickets are worthless. Perhaps they didn't bother to check the numbers, or they checked the wrong drawing or misread the winning numbers. If you find a discarded lottery ticket, it's worth taking the time to double-check. Even if the discarded ticket is a loser, there's a chance you could still win with it. If there's a second-chance drawing associated with the lottery game, you can use found tickets to enter, giving you more chances to win.      06  Take Steps to Secure Winning Lottery Tickets          •••  Keep Your Winning Lottery Ticket Secure.
        Image (c) Janet Kimber / Getty Images      If you are lucky enough to win the lottery, the last thing you want to do is let the prize slip through your fingers. To protect yourself, the very first thing you should do after you receive a lottery ticket, even before you know whether it's a winner or not, is to sign it. Your signature on the back of a lottery ticket can help prove it's yours if it gets lost or stolen. Also, never hand over a ticket to a clerk at a lottery location and ask if you've won. Use a computer terminal to determine if you're a winner, ask the clerk for the winning numbers and verify them yourself, or check online or in newspapers to find the winning numbers. It's easy for an unscrupulous clerk to pocket your ticket and tell you it was a loser. If you intend to cash a lottery ticket by mail, make sure you make copies of both sides of the ticket, in case it gets lost in transit.      07  Win a Bigger Payout by Choosing Rarer Numbers          •••  Choosing These Types of Lottery Numbers Has an Advantage.
        Image (c) Jonathan Kitchen / Getty Images      While it's not possible to predict which numbers will be chosen in any given lottery drawing, picking certain numbers might have a slight advantage, not for your chances of winning, but for your payout. If you win a lottery jackpot, there's a chance you might have to split the payout with other people who picked the same numbers. So all things being equal (in that all numbers are equally likely to be picked), you might as well try to select rarer numbers to improve your odds of keeping more of the pot for yourself. So how do you know which numbers are rare? Some people try to use statistics like those offered by Powerball to find out which numbers are chosen least often. Others look at combinations that other people tend to avoid, like consecutive numbers. Using a lottery app might help you select and remember numbers to play.      08   Beware of Lottery Scams           •••  Beware of Fake Lottery Wins.
        Image (c) Gary Waters / Getty Images      Sometimes, winning the lottery isn't as important as not losing it. Unfortunately, many scammers try to take advantage of people's dream of winning the lottery. Here are a few tips to protect yourself and avoid lottery scams: Only buy tickets from authorized lottery retailers. It's not legal to sell lottery tickets across national borders. You can usually buy tickets if you are located in the country, but offers to sell international lottery tickets by mail or through the internet are usually illegal. If you didn't buy a lottery ticket or participate in a second-chance lottery game, you didn't win. The lottery doesn't notify you when you win; you are responsible for checking your winning tickets. You're never required to pay money up-front to receive a winning lottery prize. For more tips, see Warning Signs of Sweepstakes Scams .

What are your odds of winning the lottery? Is playing the lottery a wise financial decision? How much was the largest jackpot in world history?

What would you buy if you had millions of dollars? And what if you could have millions of dollars by just spending a couple dollars? That's the lure of the lottery … A lottery is a gambling game that's used to raise money. At its most basic level, a lottery involves paying a small amount of money — to purchase a lottery ticket, for example — for the chance to win a prize, such as a large sum of money . Lotteries don't involve skill. Since lotteries are determined purely by chance, all you need to be is lucky ...VERY lucky! Today, there are many different types of lotteries: from simple “50/50" drawings at local events (the winner gets 50% of the proceeds from tickets sold) to multi-state lotteries with jackpots of several million dollars. So what are your odds of winning the jackpot ? As it turns out, they're not so good. Although the exact odds depend upon many factors, let's look at a couple of examples. In a lottery in which you pick 6 numbers from a possible pool of 49 numbers, your chances of winning the jackpot (correctly choosing all 6 numbers drawn) are 1 in 13,983,816. That's 1 shot in almost 14 million. If you were to buy one lottery ticket each week in such a scenario, you could expect to win once every 269,000 years. Unfortunately, many lotteries have even worse odds than the scenario just described. For example, the popular Mega Millions multi-state lottery has odds of approximately 1 in 175,711,536. That's right — 1 in almost 176 million! If the odds are so bad, why do so many people spend money on lottery tickets? That's a great question. For most, it appears to be the entertainment factor of taking a chance and indulging the fantasy of getting rich quickly. So should you spend money on lottery tickets? There are, after all, people who win big money. In 2007, two people split a $390 million Mega Millions jackpot , the world's largest jackpot ever. However, the odds against that happening to you are astronomical…literally. According to figures from the National Weather Service, you're over 20,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning at some point in your lifetime than you are to win the Mega Millions jackpot . An alternative to spending money on lottery tickets is investing that money. For example, if you would normally spend $150 each year on lottery tickets, consider putting that money instead in an investment that yields an 8% return . Over the course of 40 years, that yearly investment could be worth more than $38,000. Some might consider that a lottery  win in itself!

I know the chances are slim but I watch tv shows about people who win the lottery buying houses. There is many shows like this.   Reply  cancel           Wonderopolis  Mar 14, 2017    Well, it does happen.  The thing about tv is that it can make it appear that these events are more likely to happen, since you're viewing real people who have experienced them.  Still, in the real world, the odds are really low on these things ever happening to you.  Interesting question, though!

So how do you increase your chances of winning? Well, usually, by chance. The more tickets you purchase for a specific drawing, the better your chances. But there are a few people who believe there's more to it than that.         Steps    Method  1   Implement Strategies           1   Purchase more than one ticket. The more tickets purchased will increase your odds of winning.  Consider that an average state lottery has jackpot odds of about 100,000,000 to 1 -- it's often even worse: The multi-state "Powerball" lottery has jackpot odds of about 185,000,000 to 1. Holding fifty tickets only would improve your odds to 100,000,000 to 50.            2   Join a lottery pool. Get a group together at your office, school, church, activity center or any place where others are willing to share a winning ticket.  The payout that you receive will be less because you will be sharing it, but your chances of winning are slightly increased.           3   Understand that the other tickets do not affect your tickets in most lotteries.   Many people erroneously think that they have better chances of winning when fewer people play, but this is not true unless you are entering a raffle wherein a winning ticket is pulled from all the entries.  The odds of the lottery's random numbers matching your ticket's numbers are not affected by the number of people who have tickets. Think of it this way: If only one person bought just one ticket for the lottery is that person guaranteed to win? No.  However, the fewer people who play, the lower the odds of multiple winners are.           4   Play less often, but buy more. This increases your chances for that specific play.  This strategy does not affect your odds of winning in your lifetime but can affect what jackpot you win, if you win.  Instead of buying a ticket every week save up the money you would spend and use it to buy tickets when the jackpot reaches large amounts. This maximizes the return without increasing your financial risk.  You don't need to use the same numbers every time - it does not increase your odds of winning. Previous draws have no effect on future draws - each draw is a clean slate - so feel free to change your numbers each time.  People who play the same numbers every week can become 'addicted' to the lottery over fears that their usual numbers will come up if they do not buy a ticket. Using different numbers each week can help you stay in control of your gambling, and does not affect your odds of winning.  In lotteries where a winner is drawn from a raffle, you increase your odds of winning by playing the week after a huge jackpot - as typically fewer people play the lottery after a big cash prize has been won.           5   Check and double-check your tickets. Sometimes, there are several ways to win. Make sure not to assume you lost and thoroughly look over your tickets.         6   Quit while you're ahead. Getting a series of winners will only add up if you cease buying.  Set a budget and stick with it. If possible, use the lottery money you've won to purchase future tickets. That way, you dip less frequently into your main income.                 Method  2   Decide on Quick Picks vs Self Picks          1   Weigh your odds. The jury is still out. More people win via quick picks (in Powerball)-- but more people use quick picks . Statistically, the odds are the same that any combination of numbers will be picked. So, it doesn’t matter if you choose lucky numbers or let the machine choose for you. [1]   Though it may seem illogical, 1-2-3-4-5-6 is just as likely as a random selection of 6 numbers.  The only drawback of self picks is that humans are all generally programmed the same. That is, your favorite numbers are probably someone else's favorite numbers. So, if you win on 7-14-21-28-35-42, you may have to share.  Richard Lustig, 7-time lottery winner, highly advises against quick picks. [2] He argues that picking your own numbers keeps you from getting combinations of recent winners (so long as you've done your research!), thus increasing your chances. [3] .  If you are playing your state's lottery, don't bother checking to see if old winning numbers are available online. Just because a number recently came up, that doesn't alter the odds of it coming up again. Today's randomly selected numbers aren't affected by any other day's randomly selected number.              Method  3   Buy Scratchcards          1   Invest in smaller payouts. Smaller reward — more likely to win? Maybe. Mohan Srivastava, a statistician living in Toronto, says he broke the code. His story certainly involves a lot of time for a rather small payout. [4]   A typical scratchcard has odds between 1:5 and 1:2.5. Consider this when picking out your scratchers.  Ask the clerk which ones have been bought the most and returned the most winners. Pick a game that has seen mostly losses -- that way, a win should be coming up. If the odds are 1:5, purchasing 5 cards should allot you 1 winner.

However, if the lottery has a "Sum Up" bonus feature, pick any combination of numbers that adds up to 13 or 14. This gives you a 1 in 13 chance of winning the Sum Up bonus.   Thanks!

Submit       Already answered  Not a question  Bad question  Other                Tips    Keep your tickets in a safe place that is protected against moisture, heat, and creatures like bugs or rodents.  Define to yourself what you mean by 'win'. If you wish to win the jackpot only, then your chances are as given above -- i.e. 'n' tickets purchased will give you 'n' more chances of winning. However, if there are smaller prizes (e.g. three numbers out of six as in UK Lotto), then you should structure your entry to ensure that no three numbers are repeated in any selection on any of your tickets. 6C3=10 -- i.e. there are ten combinations of three from 6 on one ticket. If you purchase ten tickets, and ensure no three numbers repeat on any, your chances of winning a small prize increase from 10 to 60; however, your chances of winning the jackpot remain unaltered (improving by a factor of ten for ten tickets).  If the jackpot is very large, you may wish to contact a lawyer to help you redeem your ticket.  If you join an office pool, make sure that you receive a photocopy of all the tickets purchased from the person buying the tickets. Be sure that this person is trustworthy. Be sure to check your photocopies against the published winning numbers.  Get your winning ticket to the claims center as quick as possible. If you mail your ticket do it via certified and insured mail. Better yet, if possible, hand deliver your winning ticket to the claims center.  If you're in the UK, you need to be at least 16 to play the National Lottery and claim any prizes.       Warnings    Never spend more than you can afford on the lottery, it will only leave you worse off.  If you're in the United States, you need to be at least 18 or older to play the lottery and claim your prize.

          Updated Dec 29, 2017 2:14 PM EST   'Tis the season to start dreaming: Prizes for the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries have climbed past $300 million , with drawings set for Friday and Saturday. But don't quit your day job just yet. The odds of winning one of the jackpots is roughly one in 259 million for Mega Millions and one in 292 million for Powerball. And the chances of winning both, for those of you thinking really big? Roughly one in 75 quadrillion -- that's 15 zeros -- according to data scientists at Allstate. To understand how unlikely those odds are, it's worth comparing them to the probability of other unlikely events. Americans are much more likely to get struck by lightning (odds of one in 13,500) or to die in a car accident (one in 645). While the old lottery campaign "You've got to be in it to win it" holds true, the real value in buying a ticket may simply be to enjoy the dream of winning.     The Powerball website announced Thursday that no winning tickets had been sold. The estimated top prize for the next drawing on Saturday night is $384 million, or a cash prize of $242.9 million. The estimated Mega Millions jackpot is $306 million (or a cash option of $191 million), with the next drawing set for Friday at 11 p.m. Eastern time. Tickets cost $2. Sales time cut-offs vary by state but are usually one to two hours before the drawing. The average American spends about $200 a year on lottery tickets , though residents of some states spend far more. According to a study by LendEDU, the average Massachusetts resident spends $735 annually on lottery tickets . Rhode Islanders plop down $514 a year. And if you live in Delaware or New York, you're likely spending about $400 a year, or $33 per month (see map below). The odds of winning "scratchers" -- those little instant winning tickets that you can buy for prices ranging from $1 to $50 -- are better, but it's still no way to get rich. LendEDU experimented with determining "a return on investment" with scratchers by buying $1,000 worth of tickets. The good news: The site won with 68 of the 314 tickets -- indicating that you have a near 22 percent chance of a positive return with lottery scratchers. And, in fact, a big win ($500) on a $20 ticket helped the lending site recover the bulk of its investment. The bad news: Like most players, LendEDU lost money in the end, recovering just $974 of its $1,000. That amounts to an average return on investment of -2.6 percent. So who does make out in lottery sales? Convenience stores. Big jackpots tend to bring customers into gas stations and convenience stores, said Jeff Lenard, vice president of strategic industry initiatives at the National Association of Convenience Stores. Its members sell about two-thirds of all lottery tickets in the U.S. The giant Powerball and Mega Million jackpots are feeding on each other, with customers coming into stores to buy a ticket for one and noticing the other jackpot, he said.     "The key thing for awareness is really, once you go into the store to buy one, there's that screen that shows that there's another big jackpot," Lenard said. "It's that digital signage inside the store that's driving that double interest." Convenience stores make about a dime on a $2 ticket, or about 5 percent to 6 percent on each dollar spent. Winning stores also earn a commission, although the amount varies by state. Following are the odds of winning the jackpots, as calculated by Allstate, along with the chances of other unlikely events: Being a victim of identity theft by the age of 40 : 1 in 6 Getting bitten by a dog while out for a jog : 1 in 133 Getting a hole in one on your birthday : 1 in 25,000 Having all of the above happen to one person : 1 in 19,900,000 Winning Powerball: 1 in 292,201,338 Winning Mega Millions : 1 in 258,890,850 Winning both Powerball and Mega Millions : 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

If you do, DON  T PLAY THE LOTTERY. YOUR ODDS OF WINNING ARE AWFUL! This page will calculate your odds of winning. Here are some things to think about:  You have better chances of getting into a car accident, plane accident, or struck my lightning, than to win your lottery.  1/3 of people in the United States think winning the lottery is the only way to become financially secure in life.     How many correct numbers must you choose in order to win? (e.g. how many numbered balls or tokens are drawn for each lottery?)      What is the lowest number you can choose?    What is the highest number you can choose?         Note:
This calculation assumes that only one of each possible number will appear in the "winning numbers."  That is,
a given number, say 10, can only appear ONCE in the winning combination (most work this way).        Quick! I need help with:  Choose Math Help Item ...

There are almost as many ways of choosing lottery numbers as there are chances of winning it.  With a must-win £24.7 million jackpot up for grabs this week , picking the right numbers could change your life.  However, the first thing to realise is that the odds are stacked against you.  The chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 (or approximately 1 in 14 million), while there is a 1 in 2,330,636 chance of getting five numbers plus the bonus ball.  There is a one in 55,000 chance of five of your numbers being selected by the lottery machine.  To win the Euromillions jackpot there is a one in 116.5 million of all your numbers being drawn.       Changes to the National Lottery        T he chance winning any of the lottery prizes, however small,  is approximately 54 to 1. So an average of one million people per draw will likely win a prize.  But is there a way of narrowing these odds? Let's take a look at some of the options:  Picking the most commonly drawn numbers  One approach would be to choose the numbers that come up most often. At the moment the most frequently drawn ball is the number 44 .  Since the National Lottery began in 1994, it has been drawn 253 times.  The other most common numbers are:   38 – 251 times  40 – 249 times  23 – 248 times  39 – 246 times  33 – 245 times   However, their frequency of appearance is no indication that they will be drawn together. In fact, the chance of these numbers cropping up in a winning combination is the same as any other set of six.           1. Choosing the birthdays of family or friends  F or those who use birthdays, five of the most commonly drawn numbers are more than 31, meaning they are not likely to have picked them.  Sticking to birthdays certainly limits the range of numbers you can choose and this is a common system, so more people are likely to pick those numbers, meaning you may have to share your prize.                 And the winner is...   Credit: PA          2. Picking overdue numbers  A nother approach that is commonly used is to look for numbers that have not come up in a while.  Human intuition tells us that if something has not happened in a while, then it is probably overdue.  Currently the most overdue number is 48 – it has not been picked in nearly 81 days. Similarly, the numbers 23 and 46 last appeared 77 days ago.  The 21 ball came up 63 days ago while number 14 was selected 60 days ago and number 2 emerged 56 days ago.  The least picked numbers are 20, 13, 21, 41, 16, and 37.  However, while the concept that things which are overdue will eventually happen makes sense, it does not mean they will when it comes to the National Lottery .                 In it to win it   Credit: Paul Grover          D r John Haigh, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Sussex who has written a paper on the statistics underlying the National Lottery, said: “Just because a number has not come up for a while does not mean it will in the next draw.  “Just as you flip a coin, if you get five heads in a row, it does not mean the next time it is more likely to be tails. The odds are still 50/50.           “So with the lottery, they remain one in 14 million.”  3. Lucky numbers  L ike birthdays, this is a common approach, steeped more in superstition than any real logic. But some people are naturally drawn to certain numbers in the same way they may have a favourite colour.  Interestingly the most commonly chosen numbers are those that end in a 7 according to work done by experimental physicist Jonathan Clarke .  The key here is having enough lucky numbers to fill an entire lottery ticket – if you have to borrow numbers from someone else then they are not really lucky any more are they?  And if you win, are you going to share the jackpot with them?  4. Picking previous winning numbers  Analysis of the Swiss lottery revealed has revealed a surprising trend – people tend to choose their numbers based on the previous week’s winning numbers.  Others were found to use the jackpot numbers from two weeks before and some further back than that.  Does this make any difference? Sadly, Dr Haigh tells us the odds remain the same. But it does make picking the numbers easier.  5. Pick the best-ever performing ticket  If you had selected the ticket 03 06 13 23 27 49 in every draw since the National Lottery started you would have won £2,017,671 according to analyst Richard Lloyd .  He has found that this ticket has been the best performing in the history of the lottery so far in terms of the number of prize winning matches.           H owever, the odds of that combination coming up again remain the same.  6. The appliance of science  There is a multitude of reading material giving advice about how win the lottery.  For upwards of £20 of your hard -earned money, you too can learn how to use complicated maths or systems like wheeling to pick your numbers.  Wheeling, which is one of the most popular systems, involves buying multiple tickets and using seven numbers rather six across those, for example.  Prediction software is also widely available on the internet with accompanying claims of great accuracy.  In fact, none of these have ever been proven to be effective and experts say those that with enough people using these systems, simple statistics says some people will win using them.  Indeed, perhaps the only people who really win from these approaches are the people who pocket the cash being paid for the books in the first place.  7. The random selection  Surprisingly, this is seen as the best approach by experts.  Not because it increases your chance of winning, but because it increases your chance of winning MORE.  By selecting numbers that use systems employed by others, it is more likely that other people will also have picked those numbers too.  If your numbers were to win the jackpot, then you would have to share more of your prize with those other people.  Randomly plucking numbers means the combination is least likely to have been selected by someone else.  “If you pick the least popular numbers and win, then you will probably share your jackpot with fewer people,” explains Dr Haigh.           8. Try the aesthetic approach  I n the ninth ever draw of the National Lottery in 1995, there were a record breaking 133 winners who shared the £16 million jackpot.  Analysis of the numbers revealed an interesting phenomenon – all of the numbers were contained within the three inside columns of the playing slip at the time.  There were also no two numbers on the same row nor adjacent to each other. It appears the numbers were selected randomly for the way they looked on the slip.  Dr Haigh says: “This is a really lazy way of choosing numbers as it is an easy thing to do.  “People do like to make pretty patterns on their playing slip.  “Research on the Swiss lottery has also shown that a lot of people select numbers that go diagonally across or down the slip, for example.”  However, Dr Haigh has some final words of wisdom that may help you decide which of these methods to use.  He says: “Whatever method you chose, the chances of your six numbers coming up remain the same. It is ridiculous to think otherwise.”  But remember, if any of these tips actually do result in a jackpot win, I’m more than happy to share some of the prize.

Interested in Lottery?  Add Lottery as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Lottery news, video, and analysis from ABC News.    Lottery Add Interest The winning numbers will be chosen tonight in Tallahassee, Florida. Some experts from Powerball gave " GMA " a little insight on the odds of taking home the grand prize. If there are no winners tonight, the jackpot will jump to $1 billion, according to an official with DC Lottery. Powerball officials have added numbers to the mix — which they said makes it easier for players to win smaller prizes. But more numbers have reduced the odds of winning the top prize to 1 in 292 million, from 1 in 175 million. "More play happens at the higher level, so your odds of sharing it are greater at the greater jackpot levels," Powerball Chairman Charlie McIntyre told ABC News. There has not been a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket since June 14, when it was $40 million.  No Powerball winner in Saturday's drawing, jackpot jumps to $650 million   7 lottery jackpot winners who lost big   Powerball Lottery: Benefits and drawbacks of office pools  Powerball officials told ABC News they expect to sell 170 million tickets between last Saturday and tonight's drawing. Buying more tickets may seem like the secret to success, but McIntyre reiterated that is not necessarily the case. "Your odds are just as good as anyone else," he said. "I've paid winners who bought one ticket. I've paid winners who bought 100 tickets. So it doesn't matter — you just have to have one ticket, at least." "It's a completely random event," he added. McIntyre also said luck can strike anywhere. "I've paid them from stores that sold 10 tickets in a day ... and millions in a year, so it's completely random." Tracey Cohen, the executive director of the DC Lottery, told ABC News that players should remember one very important detail when they purchase a ticket. "Immediately sign the back of it," she said. "If you are in a group pool, make copies of the ticket, decide who will sign it and what will happen if you have a winning ticket." Even if no one wins the jackpot, prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million are still a possibility, Cohen said. "There's a 1 in 38.2 chance that you could win something," she said. Experts suggest that players use the full range of numbers available and not limit their chances by playing just numbers such as birthdays, since months have no more than 31 days and Powerball numbers go up to 69. If there is a winner, he or she could choose an annuity to receive 30 payments over 29 years or take a lump sum, which would be $443.3 million at the current jackpot, according to Powerball. The biggest Powerball jackpot was $1.6 billion in January 2016. People in California, Florida and Tennessee split the prize. Powerball is played in 44 states, the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands .    0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

There are almost as many ways of choosing lottery numbers as there are chances of winning it.  With a must-win £24.7 million jackpot up for grabs this week , picking the right numbers could change your life.  However, the first thing to realise is that the odds are stacked against you.  The chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 (or approximately 1 in 14 million), while there is a 1 in 2,330,636 chance of getting five numbers plus the bonus ball.  There is a one in 55,000 chance of five of your numbers being selected by the lottery machine.  To win the Euromillions jackpot there is a one in 116.5 million of all your numbers being drawn.       Changes to the National Lottery        T he chance winning any of the lottery prizes, however small,  is approximately 54 to 1. So an average of one million people per draw will likely win a prize.  But is there a way of narrowing these odds? Let's take a look at some of the options:  Picking the most commonly drawn numbers  One approach would be to choose the numbers that come up most often. At the moment the most frequently drawn ball is the number 44 .  Since the National Lottery began in 1994, it has been drawn 253 times.  The other most common numbers are:   38 – 251 times  40 – 249 times  23 – 248 times  39 – 246 times  33 – 245 times   However, their frequency of appearance is no indication that they will be drawn together. In fact, the chance of these numbers cropping up in a winning combination is the same as any other set of six.           1. Choosing the birthdays of family or friends  F or those who use birthdays, five of the most commonly drawn numbers are more than 31, meaning they are not likely to have picked them.  Sticking to birthdays certainly limits the range of numbers you can choose and this is a common system, so more people are likely to pick those numbers, meaning you may have to share your prize.                 And the winner is...   Credit: PA          2. Picking overdue numbers  A nother approach that is commonly used is to look for numbers that have not come up in a while.  Human intuition tells us that if something has not happened in a while, then it is probably overdue.  Currently the most overdue number is 48 – it has not been picked in nearly 81 days. Similarly, the numbers 23 and 46 last appeared 77 days ago.  The 21 ball came up 63 days ago while number 14 was selected 60 days ago and number 2 emerged 56 days ago.  The least picked numbers are 20, 13, 21, 41, 16, and 37.  However, while the concept that things which are overdue will eventually happen makes sense, it does not mean they will when it comes to the National Lottery .                 In it to win it   Credit: Paul Grover          D r John Haigh, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Sussex who has written a paper on the statistics underlying the National Lottery, said: “Just because a number has not come up for a while does not mean it will in the next draw.  “Just as you flip a coin, if you get five heads in a row, it does not mean the next time it is more likely to be tails. The odds are still 50/50.           “So with the lottery, they remain one in 14 million.”  3. Lucky numbers  L ike birthdays, this is a common approach, steeped more in superstition than any real logic. But some people are naturally drawn to certain numbers in the same way they may have a favourite colour.  Interestingly the most commonly chosen numbers are those that end in a 7 according to work done by experimental physicist Jonathan Clarke .  The key here is having enough lucky numbers to fill an entire lottery ticket – if you have to borrow numbers from someone else then they are not really lucky any more are they?  And if you win, are you going to share the jackpot with them?  4. Picking previous winning numbers  Analysis of the Swiss lottery revealed has revealed a surprising trend – people tend to choose their numbers based on the previous week’s winning numbers.  Others were found to use the jackpot numbers from two weeks before and some further back than that.  Does this make any difference? Sadly, Dr Haigh tells us the odds remain the same. But it does make picking the numbers easier.  5. Pick the best-ever performing ticket  If you had selected the ticket 03 06 13 23 27 49 in every draw since the National Lottery started you would have won £2,017,671 according to analyst Richard Lloyd .  He has found that this ticket has been the best performing in the history of the lottery so far in terms of the number of prize winning matches.           H owever, the odds of that combination coming up again remain the same.  6. The appliance of science  There is a multitude of reading material giving advice about how win the lottery.  For upwards of £20 of your hard -earned money, you too can learn how to use complicated maths or systems like wheeling to pick your numbers.  Wheeling, which is one of the most popular systems, involves buying multiple tickets and using seven numbers rather six across those, for example.  Prediction software is also widely available on the internet with accompanying claims of great accuracy.  In fact, none of these have ever been proven to be effective and experts say those that with enough people using these systems, simple statistics says some people will win using them.  Indeed, perhaps the only people who really win from these approaches are the people who pocket the cash being paid for the books in the first place.  7. The random selection  Surprisingly, this is seen as the best approach by experts.  Not because it increases your chance of winning, but because it increases your chance of winning MORE.  By selecting numbers that use systems employed by others, it is more likely that other people will also have picked those numbers too.  If your numbers were to win the jackpot, then you would have to share more of your prize with those other people.  Randomly plucking numbers means the combination is least likely to have been selected by someone else.  “If you pick the least popular numbers and win, then you will probably share your jackpot with fewer people,” explains Dr Haigh.           8. Try the aesthetic approach  I n the ninth ever draw of the National Lottery in 1995, there were a record breaking 133 winners who shared the £16 million jackpot.  Analysis of the numbers revealed an interesting phenomenon – all of the numbers were contained within the three inside columns of the playing slip at the time.  There were also no two numbers on the same row nor adjacent to each other. It appears the numbers were selected randomly for the way they looked on the slip.  Dr Haigh says: “This is a really lazy way of choosing numbers as it is an easy thing to do.  “People do like to make pretty patterns on their playing slip.  “Research on the Swiss lottery has also shown that a lot of people select numbers that go diagonally across or down the slip, for example.”  However, Dr Haigh has some final words of wisdom that may help you decide which of these methods to use.  He says: “Whatever method you chose, the chances of your six numbers coming up remain the same. It is ridiculous to think otherwise.”  But remember, if any of these tips actually do result in a jackpot win, I’m more than happy to share some of the prize.

Lustig Talent Enterprises        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     Saturday's Powerball drawing is a staggering $320 million. With such an enormous sum at stake, who better to turn to then Richard Lustig  seven-time lottery grand prize winner and author of "Learn How To Increase Your Chances of Winning The Lottery"  for tips on how to win.  Lustig says he's been playing the lottery for about 25 years. He claims to play every day, but in the first few years, he says he was not winning very much.    So Lustig decided to come up with a method, which he claims has helped him win seven grand prizes, including his last jackpot of $98,000 two-and-a-half years ago.  $320M jackpot up for grabs in Saturday's Powerball  Powerball to the people  Trekking to try hand at Powerball   Lustig says a guaranteed way to increase your chances of winning the lottery is simply by picking your own numbers versus using the "quick-pick" ticket option.  "It doesn't matter how you pick your numbers, once you pick your set of numbers, research them to know if it's a good set of numbers and stick with them. There's no magic method to picking your numbers, I get emails every day asking. One number doesn't win the jackpot, a set of numbers does," says Lustig.    "The lazy way out is to buy quick-picks. The computer picks out the numbers. Don't play quick-picks. Quick-picks are the worst thing you can do, you are playing with the worst odds," he says.  Lustig believes that what matters is whether the set of numbers people pick is a good one or not. To know this out however, one has to research the numbers in a method only taught in his book, which, as we found out, he guards very closely ... unless you buy the book.  "The research is not that easy, it takes some time. Anything in life that's worth having takes time," says Lustig.  Another important part of playing the lottery, Lustig cautions, is setting a budget of how much you can afford on tickets.    "Don't get lottery fever- don't use your grocery money, or your rent money. Remember one thing, if there is one winner on Saturday night, there will be millions of losers, don't be that person Sunday morning worrying about how you can pay back the money you spent," says Lustig.  One secret Lustig will share is that he believes picking the same numbers regularly, even if you are losing, gives you more edge in the next drawing.    Lustig says he will absolutely be playing Saturday's Powerball. But when asked what numbers he'll be playing, he wouldn't share.  "Not telling. Good try though," said Lustig.   © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

So how do you increase your chances of winning? Well, usually, by chance. The more tickets you purchase for a specific drawing, the better your chances. But there are a few people who believe there's more to it than that.         Steps    Method  1   Implement Strategies           1   Purchase more than one ticket. The more tickets purchased will increase your odds of winning.  Consider that an average state lottery has jackpot odds of about 100,000,000 to 1 -- it's often even worse: The multi-state "Powerball" lottery has jackpot odds of about 185,000,000 to 1. Holding fifty tickets only would improve your odds to 100,000,000 to 50.            2   Join a lottery pool. Get a group together at your office, school, church, activity center or any place where others are willing to share a winning ticket.  The payout that you receive will be less because you will be sharing it, but your chances of winning are slightly increased.           3   Understand that the other tickets do not affect your tickets in most lotteries.   Many people erroneously think that they have better chances of winning when fewer people play, but this is not true unless you are entering a raffle wherein a winning ticket is pulled from all the entries.  The odds of the lottery's random numbers matching your ticket's numbers are not affected by the number of people who have tickets. Think of it this way: If only one person bought just one ticket for the lottery is that person guaranteed to win? No.  However, the fewer people who play, the lower the odds of multiple winners are.           4   Play less often, but buy more. This increases your chances for that specific play.  This strategy does not affect your odds of winning in your lifetime but can affect what jackpot you win, if you win.  Instead of buying a ticket every week save up the money you would spend and use it to buy tickets when the jackpot reaches large amounts. This maximizes the return without increasing your financial risk.  You don't need to use the same numbers every time - it does not increase your odds of winning. Previous draws have no effect on future draws - each draw is a clean slate - so feel free to change your numbers each time.  People who play the same numbers every week can become 'addicted' to the lottery over fears that their usual numbers will come up if they do not buy a ticket. Using different numbers each week can help you stay in control of your gambling, and does not affect your odds of winning.  In lotteries where a winner is drawn from a raffle, you increase your odds of winning by playing the week after a huge jackpot - as typically fewer people play the lottery after a big cash prize has been won.           5   Check and double-check your tickets. Sometimes, there are several ways to win. Make sure not to assume you lost and thoroughly look over your tickets.         6   Quit while you're ahead. Getting a series of winners will only add up if you cease buying.  Set a budget and stick with it. If possible, use the lottery money you've won to purchase future tickets. That way, you dip less frequently into your main income.                 Method  2   Decide on Quick Picks vs Self Picks          1   Weigh your odds. The jury is still out. More people win via quick picks (in Powerball)-- but more people use quick picks . Statistically, the odds are the same that any combination of numbers will be picked. So, it doesn’t matter if you choose lucky numbers or let the machine choose for you. [1]   Though it may seem illogical, 1-2-3-4-5-6 is just as likely as a random selection of 6 numbers.  The only drawback of self picks is that humans are all generally programmed the same. That is, your favorite numbers are probably someone else's favorite numbers. So, if you win on 7-14-21-28-35-42, you may have to share.  Richard Lustig, 7-time lottery winner, highly advises against quick picks. [2] He argues that picking your own numbers keeps you from getting combinations of recent winners (so long as you've done your research!), thus increasing your chances. [3] .  If you are playing your state's lottery, don't bother checking to see if old winning numbers are available online. Just because a number recently came up, that doesn't alter the odds of it coming up again. Today's randomly selected numbers aren't affected by any other day's randomly selected number.              Method  3   Buy Scratchcards          1   Invest in smaller payouts. Smaller reward — more likely to win? Maybe. Mohan Srivastava, a statistician living in Toronto, says he broke the code. His story certainly involves a lot of time for a rather small payout. [4]   A typical scratchcard has odds between 1:5 and 1:2.5. Consider this when picking out your scratchers.  Ask the clerk which ones have been bought the most and returned the most winners. Pick a game that has seen mostly losses -- that way, a win should be coming up. If the odds are 1:5, purchasing 5 cards should allot you 1 winner.

However, if the lottery has a "Sum Up" bonus feature, pick any combination of numbers that adds up to 13 or 14. This gives you a 1 in 13 chance of winning the Sum Up bonus.   Thanks!

Define to yourself what you mean by 'win'. If you wish to win the jackpot only, then your chances are as given above -- i.e. 'n' tickets purchased will give you 'n' more chances of winning. However, if there are smaller prizes (e.g. three numbers out of six as in UK Lotto), then you should structure your entry to ensure that no three numbers are repeated in any selection on any of your tickets. 6C3=10 -- i.e. there are ten combinations of three from 6 on one ticket. If you purchase ten tickets, and ensure no three numbers repeat on any, your chances of winning a small prize increase from 10 to 60; however, your chances of winning the jackpot remain unaltered (improving by a factor of ten for ten tickets).  If the jackpot is very large, you may wish to contact a lawyer to help you redeem your ticket.  If you join an office pool, make sure that you receive a photocopy of all the tickets purchased from the person buying the tickets. Be sure that this person is trustworthy. Be sure to check your photocopies against the published winning numbers.  Get your winning ticket to the claims center as quick as possible. If you mail your ticket do it via certified and insured mail. Better yet, if possible, hand deliver your winning ticket to the claims center.  If you're in the UK, you need to be at least 16 to play the National Lottery and claim any prizes.       Warnings    Never spend more than you can afford on the lottery, it will only leave you worse off.  If you're in the United States, you need to be at least 18 or older to play the lottery and claim your prize.

What would you buy if you had millions of dollars? And what if you could have millions of dollars by just spending a couple dollars? That's the lure of the lottery … A lottery is a gambling game that's used to raise money. At its most basic level, a lottery involves paying a small amount of money — to purchase a lottery ticket, for example — for the chance to win a prize, such as a large sum of money . Lotteries don't involve skill. Since lotteries are determined purely by chance, all you need to be is lucky ...VERY lucky! Today, there are many different types of lotteries: from simple “50/50" drawings at local events (the winner gets 50% of the proceeds from tickets sold) to multi-state lotteries with jackpots of several million dollars. So what are your odds of winning the jackpot ? As it turns out, they're not so good. Although the exact odds depend upon many factors, let's look at a couple of examples. In a lottery in which you pick 6 numbers from a possible pool of 49 numbers, your chances of winning the jackpot (correctly choosing all 6 numbers drawn) are 1 in 13,983,816. That's 1 shot in almost 14 million. If you were to buy one lottery ticket each week in such a scenario, you could expect to win once every 269,000 years. Unfortunately, many lotteries have even worse odds than the scenario just described. For example, the popular Mega Millions multi-state lottery has odds of approximately 1 in 175,711,536. That's right — 1 in almost 176 million! If the odds are so bad, why do so many people spend money on lottery tickets? That's a great question. For most, it appears to be the entertainment factor of taking a chance and indulging the fantasy of getting rich quickly. So should you spend money on lottery tickets? There are, after all, people who win big money. In 2007, two people split a $390 million Mega Millions jackpot , the world's largest jackpot ever. However, the odds against that happening to you are astronomical…literally. According to figures from the National Weather Service, you're over 20,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning at some point in your lifetime than you are to win the Mega Millions jackpot . An alternative to spending money on lottery tickets is investing that money. For example, if you would normally spend $150 each year on lottery tickets, consider putting that money instead in an investment that yields an 8% return . Over the course of 40 years, that yearly investment could be worth more than $38,000. Some might consider that a lottery  win in itself!

I know the chances are slim but I watch tv shows about people who win the lottery buying houses. There is many shows like this.   Reply  cancel           Wonderopolis  Mar 14, 2017    Well, it does happen.  The thing about tv is that it can make it appear that these events are more likely to happen, since you're viewing real people who have experienced them.  Still, in the real world, the odds are really low on these things ever happening to you.  Interesting question, though!

I learned that the chances of winning a lottery in which you must pick six numbers out of 49 is 1 in 13,989,816.  I also learned that you are 20,000 times more likely to get struck by lightning in some point in your life than winning the Mega Millions jackpot.  Have you ever won the lottery?  I learned that if you were to buy 1 lottery ticket each week you could expect to win every 269,000 years.  I really liked this wonder.

Tweet This     on Saturday night, someone could win the largest Powerball lottery ever, $700 million    Every time you buy a quick pick, you get a different set of numbers; therefore, your odds are always going to be at their worst in that particular game,      I defy you to find anyone who has never fantasized about winning the lottery. The house! The travel! The help for loved ones and favorite charities! Someone to deliver a single, perfect piece of chocolate to your door every day! (OK, maybe that's just me.)  While most of us will never see that kind of money dumped in our laps, a select few lottery winners do actually get to realize their fantasy—and  on Saturday night, someone could win the largest Powerball lottery ever, $700 million .         Richard Lustig of Orlando, FL, has won seven lottery grand prizes through a system he developed.        One of the “luckiest” people in the nation is Richard Lustig, author of Learn How To Increase Your Chances of Winning the Lottery , who has won seven lottery grand prizes and perfected his strategy though trial and error. “When the lottery came to Florida, I was like everybody else: ‘Wow, buy lottery tickets, win a lot of money, retire, buy a big fancy yacht, whatever, blah, blah, blah,’” he said. “Like everybody else, I was running out and buying haphazardly, buying quick picks, I mean buying tickets with no plan, or no method, or whatever. Like everybody else, I was losing all the time.”  Then Lustig realized there had to be a way to increase his chances. Every time something worked, he’d write it down. Eventually, he had a “formula” that worked for him and others. His main tips--which don't all follow strict mathematical logic, and have been discounted by some as nonsense --for those playing lotteries are below:    Don’t use the “quick-pick” numbers generated from the store’s computer. Even though it seems like every number has an equal amount of “luck,” certain number sets are better than others. “  Every time you buy a quick pick, you get a different set of numbers; therefore, your odds are always going to be at their worst in that particular game, whatever game you're playing. In this case, the hype, of course, is all about the Powerball right now,” Lustig says.  Go beyond the birthdays. The spread is important—if you always choose birth month and dates, like most people do, you’re relegating yourself to less than half the numbers available, 1 through 31. Equally important about including bigger numbers: “If you pick your own numbers and only play birthdays and anniversaries, you’re splitting the pot with 20-40 people. If you spread the numbers out across the whole track, you’ll either be the only winner or will split it with only one or two people,” Lustig says.  Don’t change the numbers. Once you’ve determined which numbers are “good,” (he recommends a specific way to find these in his book) don’t switch them, play them every time. If you buy more than one card, use a different set of numbers. “Remember, a set of numbers wins the grand prize, not individual numbers,” Lustig says. He says it’s OK to repeat a number or two, but be sure each group of numbers is mostly different so you increase your odds. (Though, if you're looking at this in a solid math sense, in a fair lottery, every number has the same probability of being drawn.)  Play consistently. “Never miss a drawing in the game you’re playing. Every Saturday, every Wednesday, every week,” Lustig says.  Understand the odds, but know your limits : If you play 100 cards, you’ll have a better chance than if you pay just 10—but only play what you can afford to lose. It’s not a regular investment, as in an IRA or a stock. “One of the things that I preach to people all the time is budget, budget, budget,” Lustig says. “Set a budget of what you're going to spend. Do not get caught up in what's called lottery fever. Don't spend grocery money. Don't spend rent money. Figure out what you can afford to spend. Don't worry about how much Joe Blow down the street is spending. … Figure out what your budget is, what you can comfortably afford to spend, and stay within that budget."    Richer In 7 Hours: An eBook From Forbes   Cut your expenses, boost your net worth and secure your financial future in a day.   Does it really pay to play?  Of course, plenty of financial professionals say it's never worth it to play the lottery. Even though there's a lot to be gained, in general, playing Powerball is still a bad decision because you never get the full jackpot, and chances are  you'll be splitting it, says Paul Dreyer, a mathematician for the RAND Corporation (who, for the record, fully disagrees with the logic of Lustig's method).

        Photo: Martin Barraud/Getty Images       By  Kimberly Amadeo     Updated November 07, 2017     The biggest lottery jackpot ever was $1.6 billion on January 13, 2016. Authorities announced three winning Powerball tickets in California, Tennessee, and Florida. That beats the Mega Millions on March 31, 2012. Three winners split a $656 million jackpot. The winning tickets were sold in Illinois, Maryland, and Kansas. Those states don't have to reveal the names of the winners. The prior largest Powerball payout was close behind, at $590.5 million.           Gloria C. Mackenzie, an 84-year old Floridian, won on June 5, 2013. The odds of winning either the Powerball or Mega Millions were roughly the same: 175 million to one . Despite those odds, one-third of Americans believe that winning the lottery is the only way they will ever retire. But how likely is it? Here's a humorous look comparing the odds of winning the lottery to some other lucky and unlucky events. That's followed by strategies that are more likely to win you a bountiful retirement . Things That Are More Likely Than Winning the Lottery If you believe in the odds of winning the lottery, then you should never fly or drive. That because you are more apt to be killed in a plane crash, where the odds are 25 million to one, and far more likely to die in a car accident, where the odds are only 5,000 to one. Similarly, you should start sleeping on the floor and taking showers. That's because the odds of being killed by falling out of bed are 2 million to one, while the odds of drowning while taking a bath are 840,000 to one.     But don't think you can improve your chances by avoiding cleanliness altogether. The odds of dying from a flesh-eating bacteria are only 1 million to one. Maybe you'll have better luck outside. Not! The odds of being killed by lightning are 2 million to one while being mauled to death by a dog are 700,000 to one.           Bring your anti-venom kit, because you are even more likely to die from a snake bite or bee sting, where the odds are 100,000 to one. If these statistics have you feeling a little paranoid, cheer up. Many good things are also more likely than winning the lottery. For example, the odds of becoming a movie star are only 1.5 million to one, while the odds of getting a royal flush in the first hand of poker are just 649,740 to one. Even better (guys), the odds of dating a supermodel are a measly 88,000 to one. To put it all into perspective, consider this. Scientists have calculated that there is just a 300 to one chance that asteroid 2004 MN4 will strike the Earth on April 13, 2029. The asteroid is about a quarter mile (400 meters) wide. That is larger than the asteroid that carved out Meteor Crater in Arizona, and the one that flattened thousands of square miles of forest in Siberia in 1908. Things You No Longer Have to Worry About OK, time for a little cheering up again. Many bad things are less likely than winning the lottery. For example, it's safe to go back into the water. The odds of dying from a shark attack are 300 million to one, only half as likely as winning the lottery. Swimming with the sharks is much safer than petting a dog, driving your car, or sleeping in your bed.            How to Improve Your Odds If you've read all these statistics, and still want to play the lottery, here are some ways to improve your chances. First, use the computer-generated numbers, they tend to be the luckiest. That's because there is less chance of someone else picking a duplicate number. Furthermore, only 30 percent of the winning numbers were the players' "lucky" numbers. Whatever you do, don't pick "lucky" seven, 11, or a birthday. You can be sure that someone else will have also picked those numbers. Second, be sure to play the $1 million or $2 million second prize in the Powerball. There, you only have to match five of the six numbers. Those odds are one out of 5 million. You get even better odds if you just play in the state lotteries instead of the national one. How to Improve Your Chances of Attaining Retirement Perhaps you are one of those who consider the lottery their best chance of retiring.  Well, consider this comparison instead. Let's say you currently buy a $2 lottery ticket every week for the next 17 years (before the 300 to one chance the asteroid hits Earth). There is little likelihood, based on the odds, that you would have won. If you instead invested that $2 a week in securities and got a 5 percent return, you would have accumulated $2,926. Doesn't sound like much, does it? Let's say you invested $2 a day instead. You would wind up with $20,5361 by 2029. Your return will probably be greater than that. Before the 2008 financial crisis , the average stock market return was 10 percent a year. If you get that return over the next 17 years, then your $2 a day would become $33,287. True, that's not enough to retire on. But what if you increased it to $5 a day. You'd wind up with $83,220. Or doubled that, and invested $10 a day, you'd get $166,436. Now you're talking. The point is that you do have better odds for a successful retirement if you plan for it than by playing the lottery. You don't have to depend on fate, chance or luck. You can take matters into your own hands, starting today.

Common-Sense Lottery-Winning Tips        Share       Flip       Pin       Email        By  Sandra Grauschopf     Updated March 18, 2018      If you read books or search the internet for how to win the lottery, you'll find a lot of tips that don't work. Lottery frequency schemes (every number has an equal chance of winning, no matter how recently it was drawn), software that's supposed to be better at picking numbers, and other forms of wishful thinking abound. There is no way to predict the numbers that will come up in the lottery. The drawings are completely random, so the best you can do is try to pick unusual numbers so you won't have to split in case there's a tie. That doesn't mean that there's no way of increasing your odds of winning, though. Here are some common-sense tips that really will help you win the lottery .      01   Improve Your Chances of Winning the Lottery by Playing the Right Games           •••  Different Lottery Games Have Different Odds and Payouts. Choose Wisely.
        Image (c) Scott Olson / Getty Images      People talk about winning the lottery as if it were just one game. But every state has a selection of lottery games with different odds of winning. Read the odds before you spend your money to ensure you're maximizing your chances of winning. Remember that lottery games like Powerball and MegaMillions are national lotteries, so they have a much broader entry pool. State lotteries, where players have to physically be in that state to buy a ticket, usually have better odds. And don't write off scratch-off games, which might have smaller prizes but higher chances of winning overall.               02   Get More Entries Without Spending More Money with Lottery Pools           •••  A Lottery Pool Can Give You Better Chances of Winning for the Same Price.
        Image (c) Achim Sass / Getty Images      The easiest way to boost your odds of winning lotteries is simply to buy more tickets. But of course, that costs money, and even if you invest a lot of money in tickets, your odds of winning are still poor. But lottery pools give you the opportunity to improve your odds without spending more money. Consider join your office lottery pool or starting one of your own to get better chances of winning without breaking your budget.               03   Don't Miss a Lottery Win: Double-Check Your Numbers!           •••  Double-Check Your Lottery Tickets So You Don't Miss a Win.
        Saturated / Getty Images      Imagine actually winning a big jackpot... but missing out on your money because you forgot to double-check your numbers. It happens more often than you think. For example, one MegaMillions lottery ticket worth nearly $300,000 went unclaimed. Don't let that happen to you. When you buy a lottery ticket, keep it somewhere where you can find it again easily. Jot down the drawing date and time in your calendar if you're afraid you might forget it. Check the numbers against your ticket, and double-check them, just to be sure. Also, make sure that you are looking at the numbers for the correct date. Some people like to have convenience store clerks verify their tickets to be sure they don't make a mistake while checking their numbers. If you decide to do this, make sure you follow the tips below to avoid a scam. If you miss your lottery announcement, check out this state-by-state listing of winning lottery results .               04  Multiply Your Chances of Winning the Lottery with Second-Chance Games          •••  Don't Pass Up Another Chance to Win the Lottery.
        Image (c) Tetra Images / Getty Images      OK, so your numbers didn't come up in the drawing. That means it's time to toss your lottery ticket, right? Wrong! On June 8, 2010, an About.com Sweepstakes Forum member going by the name KentuckyBell reported a big lottery win. But she didn't win because of the numbers she played when she bought the ticket, but because she entered the second-chance game in the Kentucky Lottery. Her name was randomly drawn as the winner, and she took home $120,610.70 after taxes. So don't give up just because you didn't win the first time. If your lottery game includes a second-chance drawing, entering could be your ticket to winning.      05  Someone Else's Loss Might Be Your Lottery Ticket Win          •••  Keeping Your Eyes Open Could Score You a Lottery Win.
        Image (c) Image Source / Getty Images      A lot of people throw out their lottery tickets after a drawing, but that doesn't mean that the tickets are worthless. Perhaps they didn't bother to check the numbers, or they checked the wrong drawing or misread the winning numbers. If you find a discarded lottery ticket, it's worth taking the time to double-check. Even if the discarded ticket is a loser, there's a chance you could still win with it. If there's a second-chance drawing associated with the lottery game, you can use found tickets to enter, giving you more chances to win.      06  Take Steps to Secure Winning Lottery Tickets          •••  Keep Your Winning Lottery Ticket Secure.
        Image (c) Janet Kimber / Getty Images      If you are lucky enough to win the lottery, the last thing you want to do is let the prize slip through your fingers. To protect yourself, the very first thing you should do after you receive a lottery ticket, even before you know whether it's a winner or not, is to sign it. Your signature on the back of a lottery ticket can help prove it's yours if it gets lost or stolen. Also, never hand over a ticket to a clerk at a lottery location and ask if you've won. Use a computer terminal to determine if you're a winner, ask the clerk for the winning numbers and verify them yourself, or check online or in newspapers to find the winning numbers. It's easy for an unscrupulous clerk to pocket your ticket and tell you it was a loser. If you intend to cash a lottery ticket by mail, make sure you make copies of both sides of the ticket, in case it gets lost in transit.      07  Win a Bigger Payout by Choosing Rarer Numbers          •••  Choosing These Types of Lottery Numbers Has an Advantage.
        Image (c) Jonathan Kitchen / Getty Images      While it's not possible to predict which numbers will be chosen in any given lottery drawing, picking certain numbers might have a slight advantage, not for your chances of winning, but for your payout. If you win a lottery jackpot, there's a chance you might have to split the payout with other people who picked the same numbers. So all things being equal (in that all numbers are equally likely to be picked), you might as well try to select rarer numbers to improve your odds of keeping more of the pot for yourself. So how do you know which numbers are rare? Some people try to use statistics like those offered by Powerball to find out which numbers are chosen least often. Others look at combinations that other people tend to avoid, like consecutive numbers. Using a lottery app might help you select and remember numbers to play.      08   Beware of Lottery Scams           •••  Beware of Fake Lottery Wins.
        Image (c) Gary Waters / Getty Images      Sometimes, winning the lottery isn't as important as not losing it. Unfortunately, many scammers try to take advantage of people's dream of winning the lottery. Here are a few tips to protect yourself and avoid lottery scams: Only buy tickets from authorized lottery retailers. It's not legal to sell lottery tickets across national borders. You can usually buy tickets if you are located in the country, but offers to sell international lottery tickets by mail or through the internet are usually illegal. If you didn't buy a lottery ticket or participate in a second-chance lottery game, you didn't win. The lottery doesn't notify you when you win; you are responsible for checking your winning tickets. You're never required to pay money up-front to receive a winning lottery prize. For more tips, see Warning Signs of Sweepstakes Scams .

What are your odds of winning the lottery? Is playing the lottery a wise financial decision? How much was the largest jackpot in world history?

What would you buy if you had millions of dollars? And what if you could have millions of dollars by just spending a couple dollars? That's the lure of the lottery … A lottery is a gambling game that's used to raise money. At its most basic level, a lottery involves paying a small amount of money — to purchase a lottery ticket, for example — for the chance to win a prize, such as a large sum of money . Lotteries don't involve skill. Since lotteries are determined purely by chance, all you need to be is lucky ...VERY lucky! Today, there are many different types of lotteries: from simple “50/50" drawings at local events (the winner gets 50% of the proceeds from tickets sold) to multi-state lotteries with jackpots of several million dollars. So what are your odds of winning the jackpot ? As it turns out, they're not so good. Although the exact odds depend upon many factors, let's look at a couple of examples. In a lottery in which you pick 6 numbers from a possible pool of 49 numbers, your chances of winning the jackpot (correctly choosing all 6 numbers drawn) are 1 in 13,983,816. That's 1 shot in almost 14 million. If you were to buy one lottery ticket each week in such a scenario, you could expect to win once every 269,000 years. Unfortunately, many lotteries have even worse odds than the scenario just described. For example, the popular Mega Millions multi-state lottery has odds of approximately 1 in 175,711,536. That's right — 1 in almost 176 million! If the odds are so bad, why do so many people spend money on lottery tickets? That's a great question. For most, it appears to be the entertainment factor of taking a chance and indulging the fantasy of getting rich quickly. So should you spend money on lottery tickets? There are, after all, people who win big money. In 2007, two people split a $390 million Mega Millions jackpot , the world's largest jackpot ever. However, the odds against that happening to you are astronomical…literally. According to figures from the National Weather Service, you're over 20,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning at some point in your lifetime than you are to win the Mega Millions jackpot . An alternative to spending money on lottery tickets is investing that money. For example, if you would normally spend $150 each year on lottery tickets, consider putting that money instead in an investment that yields an 8% return . Over the course of 40 years, that yearly investment could be worth more than $38,000. Some might consider that a lottery  win in itself!

I know the chances are slim but I watch tv shows about people who win the lottery buying houses. There is many shows like this.   Reply  cancel           Wonderopolis  Mar 14, 2017    Well, it does happen.  The thing about tv is that it can make it appear that these events are more likely to happen, since you're viewing real people who have experienced them.  Still, in the real world, the odds are really low on these things ever happening to you.  Interesting question, though!

I learned that the chances of winning a lottery in which you must pick six numbers out of 49 is 1 in 13,989,816.  I also learned that you are 20,000 times more likely to get struck by lightning in some point in your life than winning the Mega Millions jackpot.  Have you ever won the lottery?  I learned that if you were to buy 1 lottery ticket each week you could expect to win every 269,000 years.  I really liked this wonder.

We learned that it's 176,000,000 of a chance of winning.    That's crazy and amazing!  The chances of winning is very small. I don't think I will play.

So how do you increase your chances of winning? Well, usually, by chance. The more tickets you purchase for a specific drawing, the better your chances. But there are a few people who believe there's more to it than that.         Steps    Method  1   Implement Strategies           1   Purchase more than one ticket. The more tickets purchased will increase your odds of winning.  Consider that an average state lottery has jackpot odds of about 100,000,000 to 1 -- it's often even worse: The multi-state "Powerball" lottery has jackpot odds of about 185,000,000 to 1. Holding fifty tickets only would improve your odds to 100,000,000 to 50.            2   Join a lottery pool. Get a group together at your office, school, church, activity center or any place where others are willing to share a winning ticket.  The payout that you receive will be less because you will be sharing it, but your chances of winning are slightly increased.           3   Understand that the other tickets do not affect your tickets in most lotteries.   Many people erroneously think that they have better chances of winning when fewer people play, but this is not true unless you are entering a raffle wherein a winning ticket is pulled from all the entries.  The odds of the lottery's random numbers matching your ticket's numbers are not affected by the number of people who have tickets. Think of it this way: If only one person bought just one ticket for the lottery is that person guaranteed to win? No.  However, the fewer people who play, the lower the odds of multiple winners are.           4   Play less often, but buy more. This increases your chances for that specific play.  This strategy does not affect your odds of winning in your lifetime but can affect what jackpot you win, if you win.  Instead of buying a ticket every week save up the money you would spend and use it to buy tickets when the jackpot reaches large amounts. This maximizes the return without increasing your financial risk.  You don't need to use the same numbers every time - it does not increase your odds of winning. Previous draws have no effect on future draws - each draw is a clean slate - so feel free to change your numbers each time.  People who play the same numbers every week can become 'addicted' to the lottery over fears that their usual numbers will come up if they do not buy a ticket. Using different numbers each week can help you stay in control of your gambling, and does not affect your odds of winning.  In lotteries where a winner is drawn from a raffle, you increase your odds of winning by playing the week after a huge jackpot - as typically fewer people play the lottery after a big cash prize has been won.           5   Check and double-check your tickets. Sometimes, there are several ways to win. Make sure not to assume you lost and thoroughly look over your tickets.         6   Quit while you're ahead. Getting a series of winners will only add up if you cease buying.  Set a budget and stick with it. If possible, use the lottery money you've won to purchase future tickets. That way, you dip less frequently into your main income.                 Method  2   Decide on Quick Picks vs Self Picks          1   Weigh your odds. The jury is still out. More people win via quick picks (in Powerball)-- but more people use quick picks . Statistically, the odds are the same that any combination of numbers will be picked. So, it doesn’t matter if you choose lucky numbers or let the machine choose for you. [1]   Though it may seem illogical, 1-2-3-4-5-6 is just as likely as a random selection of 6 numbers.  The only drawback of self picks is that humans are all generally programmed the same. That is, your favorite numbers are probably someone else's favorite numbers. So, if you win on 7-14-21-28-35-42, you may have to share.  Richard Lustig, 7-time lottery winner, highly advises against quick picks. [2] He argues that picking your own numbers keeps you from getting combinations of recent winners (so long as you've done your research!), thus increasing your chances. [3] .  If you are playing your state's lottery, don't bother checking to see if old winning numbers are available online. Just because a number recently came up, that doesn't alter the odds of it coming up again. Today's randomly selected numbers aren't affected by any other day's randomly selected number.              Method  3   Buy Scratchcards          1   Invest in smaller payouts. Smaller reward — more likely to win? Maybe. Mohan Srivastava, a statistician living in Toronto, says he broke the code. His story certainly involves a lot of time for a rather small payout. [4]   A typical scratchcard has odds between 1:5 and 1:2.5. Consider this when picking out your scratchers.  Ask the clerk which ones have been bought the most and returned the most winners. Pick a game that has seen mostly losses -- that way, a win should be coming up. If the odds are 1:5, purchasing 5 cards should allot you 1 winner.

Define to yourself what you mean by 'win'. If you wish to win the jackpot only, then your chances are as given above -- i.e. 'n' tickets purchased will give you 'n' more chances of winning. However, if there are smaller prizes (e.g. three numbers out of six as in UK Lotto), then you should structure your entry to ensure that no three numbers are repeated in any selection on any of your tickets. 6C3=10 -- i.e. there are ten combinations of three from 6 on one ticket. If you purchase ten tickets, and ensure no three numbers repeat on any, your chances of winning a small prize increase from 10 to 60; however, your chances of winning the jackpot remain unaltered (improving by a factor of ten for ten tickets).  If the jackpot is very large, you may wish to contact a lawyer to help you redeem your ticket.  If you join an office pool, make sure that you receive a photocopy of all the tickets purchased from the person buying the tickets. Be sure that this person is trustworthy. Be sure to check your photocopies against the published winning numbers.  Get your winning ticket to the claims center as quick as possible. If you mail your ticket do it via certified and insured mail. Better yet, if possible, hand deliver your winning ticket to the claims center.  If you're in the UK, you need to be at least 16 to play the National Lottery and claim any prizes.       Warnings    Never spend more than you can afford on the lottery, it will only leave you worse off.  If you're in the United States, you need to be at least 18 or older to play the lottery and claim your prize.

          Updated Dec 29, 2017 2:14 PM EST   'Tis the season to start dreaming: Prizes for the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries have climbed past $300 million , with drawings set for Friday and Saturday. But don't quit your day job just yet. The odds of winning one of the jackpots is roughly one in 259 million for Mega Millions and one in 292 million for Powerball. And the chances of winning both, for those of you thinking really big? Roughly one in 75 quadrillion -- that's 15 zeros -- according to data scientists at Allstate. To understand how unlikely those odds are, it's worth comparing them to the probability of other unlikely events. Americans are much more likely to get struck by lightning (odds of one in 13,500) or to die in a car accident (one in 645). While the old lottery campaign "You've got to be in it to win it" holds true, the real value in buying a ticket may simply be to enjoy the dream of winning.     The Powerball website announced Thursday that no winning tickets had been sold. The estimated top prize for the next drawing on Saturday night is $384 million, or a cash prize of $242.9 million. The estimated Mega Millions jackpot is $306 million (or a cash option of $191 million), with the next drawing set for Friday at 11 p.m. Eastern time. Tickets cost $2. Sales time cut-offs vary by state but are usually one to two hours before the drawing. The average American spends about $200 a year on lottery tickets , though residents of some states spend far more. According to a study by LendEDU, the average Massachusetts resident spends $735 annually on lottery tickets . Rhode Islanders plop down $514 a year. And if you live in Delaware or New York, you're likely spending about $400 a year, or $33 per month (see map below). The odds of winning "scratchers" -- those little instant winning tickets that you can buy for prices ranging from $1 to $50 -- are better, but it's still no way to get rich. LendEDU experimented with determining "a return on investment" with scratchers by buying $1,000 worth of tickets. The good news: The site won with 68 of the 314 tickets -- indicating that you have a near 22 percent chance of a positive return with lottery scratchers. And, in fact, a big win ($500) on a $20 ticket helped the lending site recover the bulk of its investment. The bad news: Like most players, LendEDU lost money in the end, recovering just $974 of its $1,000. That amounts to an average return on investment of -2.6 percent. So who does make out in lottery sales? Convenience stores. Big jackpots tend to bring customers into gas stations and convenience stores, said Jeff Lenard, vice president of strategic industry initiatives at the National Association of Convenience Stores. Its members sell about two-thirds of all lottery tickets in the U.S. The giant Powerball and Mega Million jackpots are feeding on each other, with customers coming into stores to buy a ticket for one and noticing the other jackpot, he said.     "The key thing for awareness is really, once you go into the store to buy one, there's that screen that shows that there's another big jackpot," Lenard said. "It's that digital signage inside the store that's driving that double interest." Convenience stores make about a dime on a $2 ticket, or about 5 percent to 6 percent on each dollar spent. Winning stores also earn a commission, although the amount varies by state. Following are the odds of winning the jackpots, as calculated by Allstate, along with the chances of other unlikely events: Being a victim of identity theft by the age of 40 : 1 in 6 Getting bitten by a dog while out for a jog : 1 in 133 Getting a hole in one on your birthday : 1 in 25,000 Having all of the above happen to one person : 1 in 19,900,000 Winning Powerball: 1 in 292,201,338 Winning Mega Millions : 1 in 258,890,850 Winning both Powerball and Mega Millions : 1 in 75,648,252,765,957,300   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

If you do, DON  T PLAY THE LOTTERY. YOUR ODDS OF WINNING ARE AWFUL! This page will calculate your odds of winning. Here are some things to think about:  You have better chances of getting into a car accident, plane accident, or struck my lightning, than to win your lottery.  1/3 of people in the United States think winning the lottery is the only way to become financially secure in life.     How many correct numbers must you choose in order to win? (e.g. how many numbered balls or tokens are drawn for each lottery?)      What is the lowest number you can choose?    What is the highest number you can choose?         Note:
This calculation assumes that only one of each possible number will appear in the "winning numbers."  That is,
a given number, say 10, can only appear ONCE in the winning combination (most work this way).        Quick! I need help with:  Choose Math Help Item ...

There are almost as many ways of choosing lottery numbers as there are chances of winning it.  With a must-win £24.7 million jackpot up for grabs this week , picking the right numbers could change your life.  However, the first thing to realise is that the odds are stacked against you.  The chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816 (or approximately 1 in 14 million), while there is a 1 in 2,330,636 chance of getting five numbers plus the bonus ball.  There is a one in 55,000 chance of five of your numbers being selected by the lottery machine.  To win the Euromillions jackpot there is a one in 116.5 million of all your numbers being drawn.       Changes to the National Lottery        T he chance winning any of the lottery prizes, however small,  is approximately 54 to 1. So an average of one million people per draw will likely win a prize.  But is there a way of narrowing these odds? Let's take a look at some of the options:  Picking the most commonly drawn numbers  One approach would be to choose the numbers that come up most often. At the moment the most frequently drawn ball is the number 44 .  Since the National Lottery began in 1994, it has been drawn 253 times.  The other most common numbers are:   38 – 251 times  40 – 249 times  23 – 248 times  39 – 246 times  33 – 245 times   However, their frequency of appearance is no indication that they will be drawn together. In fact, the chance of these numbers cropping up in a winning combination is the same as any other set of six.           1. Choosing the birthdays of family or friends  F or those who use birthdays, five of the most commonly drawn numbers are more than 31, meaning they are not likely to have picked them.  Sticking to birthdays certainly limits the range of numbers you can choose and this is a common system, so more people are likely to pick those numbers, meaning you may have to share your prize.                 And the winner is...   Credit: PA          2. Picking overdue numbers  A nother approach that is commonly used is to look for numbers that have not come up in a while.  Human intuition tells us that if something has not happened in a while, then it is probably overdue.  Currently the most overdue number is 48 – it has not been picked in nearly 81 days. Similarly, the numbers 23 and 46 last appeared 77 days ago.  The 21 ball came up 63 days ago while number 14 was selected 60 days ago and number 2 emerged 56 days ago.  The least picked numbers are 20, 13, 21, 41, 16, and 37.  However, while the concept that things which are overdue will eventually happen makes sense, it does not mean they will when it comes to the National Lottery .                 In it to win it   Credit: Paul Grover          D r John Haigh, an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Sussex who has written a paper on the statistics underlying the National Lottery, said: “Just because a number has not come up for a while does not mean it will in the next draw.  “Just as you flip a coin, if you get five heads in a row, it does not mean the next time it is more likely to be tails. The odds are still 50/50.           “So with the lottery, they remain one in 14 million.”  3. Lucky numbers  L ike birthdays, this is a common approach, steeped more in superstition than any real logic. But some people are naturally drawn to certain numbers in the same way they may have a favourite colour.  Interestingly the most commonly chosen numbers are those that end in a 7 according to work done by experimental physicist Jonathan Clarke .  The key here is having enough lucky numbers to fill an entire lottery ticket – if you have to borrow numbers from someone else then they are not really lucky any more are they?  And if you win, are you going to share the jackpot with them?  4. Picking previous winning numbers  Analysis of the Swiss lottery revealed has revealed a surprising trend – people tend to choose their numbers based on the previous week’s winning numbers.  Others were found to use the jackpot numbers from two weeks before and some further back than that.  Does this make any difference? Sadly, Dr Haigh tells us the odds remain the same. But it does make picking the numbers easier.  5. Pick the best-ever performing ticket  If you had selected the ticket 03 06 13 23 27 49 in every draw since the National Lottery started you would have won £2,017,671 according to analyst Richard Lloyd .  He has found that this ticket has been the best performing in the history of the lottery so far in terms of the number of prize winning matches.           H owever, the odds of that combination coming up again remain the same.  6. The appliance of science  There is a multitude of reading material giving advice about how win the lottery.  For upwards of £20 of your hard -earned money, you too can learn how to use complicated maths or systems like wheeling to pick your numbers.  Wheeling, which is one of the most popular systems, involves buying multiple tickets and using seven numbers rather six across those, for example.  Prediction software is also widely available on the internet with accompanying claims of great accuracy.  In fact, none of these have ever been proven to be effective and experts say those that with enough people using these systems, simple statistics says some people will win using them.  Indeed, perhaps the only people who really win from these approaches are the people who pocket the cash being paid for the books in the first place.  7. The random selection  Surprisingly, this is seen as the best approach by experts.  Not because it increases your chance of winning, but because it increases your chance of winning MORE.  By selecting numbers that use systems employed by others, it is more likely that other people will also have picked those numbers too.  If your numbers were to win the jackpot, then you would have to share more of your prize with those other people.  Randomly plucking numbers means the combination is least likely to have been selected by someone else.  “If you pick the least popular numbers and win, then you will probably share your jackpot with fewer people,” explains Dr Haigh.           8. Try the aesthetic approach  I n the ninth ever draw of the National Lottery in 1995, there were a record breaking 133 winners who shared the £16 million jackpot.  Analysis of the numbers revealed an interesting phenomenon – all of the numbers were contained within the three inside columns of the playing slip at the time.  There were also no two numbers on the same row nor adjacent to each other. It appears the numbers were selected randomly for the way they looked on the slip.  Dr Haigh says: “This is a really lazy way of choosing numbers as it is an easy thing to do.  “People do like to make pretty patterns on their playing slip.  “Research on the Swiss lottery has also shown that a lot of people select numbers that go diagonally across or down the slip, for example.”  However, Dr Haigh has some final words of wisdom that may help you decide which of these methods to use.  He says: “Whatever method you chose, the chances of your six numbers coming up remain the same. It is ridiculous to think otherwise.”  But remember, if any of these tips actually do result in a jackpot win, I’m more than happy to share some of the prize.

Breaking down the odds of winning Powerball's $700M jackpot     By Kelly McCarthy  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Kelly   Aug 23, 2017, 9:37 AM ET   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play G-Jun Yam/AP WATCH How did Powerball jackpot grow to $700M?  0 Shares               Email      The second-biggest Powerball drawing in U.S. history has reached $700 million, and that number could rise as more people buy tickets.   Interested in Lottery?  Add Lottery as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Lottery news, video, and analysis from ABC News.    Lottery Add Interest The winning numbers will be chosen tonight in Tallahassee, Florida. Some experts from Powerball gave " GMA " a little insight on the odds of taking home the grand prize. If there are no winners tonight, the jackpot will jump to $1 billion, according to an official with DC Lottery. Powerball officials have added numbers to the mix — which they said makes it easier for players to win smaller prizes. But more numbers have reduced the odds of winning the top prize to 1 in 292 million, from 1 in 175 million. "More play happens at the higher level, so your odds of sharing it are greater at the greater jackpot levels," Powerball Chairman Charlie McIntyre told ABC News. There has not been a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket since June 14, when it was $40 million.  No Powerball winner in Saturday's drawing, jackpot jumps to $650 million   7 lottery jackpot winners who lost big   Powerball Lottery: Benefits and drawbacks of office pools  Powerball officials told ABC News they expect to sell 170 million tickets between last Saturday and tonight's drawing. Buying more tickets may seem like the secret to success, but McIntyre reiterated that is not necessarily the case. "Your odds are just as good as anyone else," he said. "I've paid winners who bought one ticket. I've paid winners who bought 100 tickets. So it doesn't matter — you just have to have one ticket, at least." "It's a completely random event," he added. McIntyre also said luck can strike anywhere. "I've paid them from stores that sold 10 tickets in a day ... and millions in a year, so it's completely random." Tracey Cohen, the executive director of the DC Lottery, told ABC News that players should remember one very important detail when they purchase a ticket. "Immediately sign the back of it," she said. "If you are in a group pool, make copies of the ticket, decide who will sign it and what will happen if you have a winning ticket." Even if no one wins the jackpot, prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million are still a possibility, Cohen said. "There's a 1 in 38.2 chance that you could win something," she said. Experts suggest that players use the full range of numbers available and not limit their chances by playing just numbers such as birthdays, since months have no more than 31 days and Powerball numbers go up to 69. If there is a winner, he or she could choose an annuity to receive 30 payments over 29 years or take a lump sum, which would be $443.3 million at the current jackpot, according to Powerball. The biggest Powerball jackpot was $1.6 billion in January 2016. People in California, Florida and Tennessee split the prize. Powerball is played in 44 states, the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands .    0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.
