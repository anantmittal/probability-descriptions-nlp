The end of treatment can be both stressful and exciting. You may be relieved to finish treatment, but yet it’s hard not to worry about cancer coming back. This is very common if you’ve had cancer.  For others , the cancer might never go away completely. Some people may get  treatments  to try and help keep the cancer in check or ease problems it's causing. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful.  Life after vulvar cancer means returning to some familiar things and also making some new choices.  Follow-up care  When treatment ends, your doctors will still want to watch you closely. It's very important to go to all of your follow-up appointments. During these visits, your doctors will ask questions about any problems you may have and may do exams and lab tests or x-rays and scans to look for signs of cancer or treatment side effects. Almost any cancer treatment can have side effects . Some may last for a few weeks to months, but others can last the rest of your life. This is the time for you to talk to your cancer care team about any changes or problems you notice and any questions or concerns you have.  Lymphedema is a common side effect when lymph nodes are removed as part of surgery for vulvar cancer. Your doctor will talk to you about lymphedema and what you can do to try to keep it from starting . 
    Be sure to tell your doctor about any swelling, heaviness, pain, or skin changes you notice in your genitals or your legs.  Ask your doctor for a survivorship care plan  Talk with your doctor about developing a survivorship care plan for you. This plan might include:   A suggested schedule for follow-up exams and tests  A schedule for other tests you might need in the future, such as early detection (screening) tests for other types of cancer, or tests to look for long-term health effects from your cancer or its treatment  A list of possible late- or long-term side effects from your treatment, including what to watch for and when you should contact your doctor  Diet and physical activity suggestions  Reminders to keep your appointments with your primary care provider (PCP), who will monitor your general health care   Keeping health insurance and copies of your medical records  Even after treatment, it’s very important to keep health insurance. Tests and doctor visits cost a lot, and even though no one wants to think of their cancer coming back, this could happen.  At some point after your cancer treatment, you might find yourself seeing a new doctor who doesn’t know about your medical history. It’s important to keep copies of your medical records to give your new doctor the details of your diagnosis and treatment. Learn more in Keeping Copies of Important Medical Records .  Can I lower my risk of vulvar  cancer progressing or coming back?  If you have (or have had) vulvar cancer, you probably want to know if there are things you can do that might lower your risk of the cancer growing or coming back, such as exercising, eating a certain type of diet, or taking nutritional supplements. Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear if there are things you can do that will help.  Adopting healthy behaviors such as not smoking , eating well , getting regular physical activity , and staying at a healthy weight might help, but no one knows for sure. However, we do know that these types of changes can have positive effects on your health that can extend beyond your risk of vulvar  cancer or other cancers.  About dietary supplements  So far, no dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbal products) have been shown to clearly help lower the risk of vulvar  cancer progressing or coming back. This doesn’t mean that no supplements will help, but it’s important to know that none have been proven to do so.  Dietary supplements are not regulated like medicines in the United States – they do not have to be proven effective (or even safe) before being sold, although there are limits on what they’re allowed to claim they can do. If you’re thinking about taking any type of nutritional supplement, talk to your health care team. They can help you decide which ones you can use safely while avoiding those that might be harmful.  If the cancer comes back  If the cancer does recur at some point, your treatment options will depend on where the cancer is located, what treatments you’ve had before, and your overall health. For general information on recurrence, you may want to see Understanding Recurrence .  Could I get a second cancer after treatment?  Women who’ve had vulvar  cancer can still get other cancers. In fact, vulvar cancer survivors are at higher risk for getting some other types of cancer. Learn more in ﻿﻿ Second Cancers After Vulvar Cancer .  Getting emotional support  Some  feelings of depression, anxiety, or worriy are normal when cancer is a part of your life. Some people are affected more than others. But everyone can benefit from help and support from other people, whether friends and family, religious groups, support groups, professional counselors, or others.

Other factors that affect this decision include the exact location of the cancer on the vulva, the type of vulvar cancer , your age, your preferences, and your overall health.  Because vulvar cancer is rare, it's hard to study it well. Most experts agree that treatment in a clinical trial should be considered. This way women can get the best treatment available now and may also get the treatments that are thought to be even better.  Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)  Treatment options for carcinoma in situ and for small pre-cancerous changes ( vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia , or VIN) are the same. If left untreated, nearly all will progress to invasive vulvar cancer. Surgery , such as laser surgery, wide local excision, or a skinning vulvectomy may be used, depending on the size and location of the cancer. A topical therapy such as fluorouracil (5-FU) ointment or imiquimod cream may be applied to the abnormal areas. Even if treated, stage 0 cancers may recur (come back) or new stage 0 cancers may form on other areas of the vulva, so good follow-up care is important.  Stage I  Treatment options depend on the size and depth of the cancer and whether the patient also has VIN. If the depth of invasion is 1 mm or less (stage IA) and there are no other areas of cancer or VIN, the cancer is surgically removed along with a 1 cm (less than half an inch) rim (margin) of normal tissue around it.  For stage IB cancers, treatment may include a partial radical vulvectomy and inguinal lymph node dissection (removal of nearby groin lymph nodes). Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done instead of the lymph node dissection. If cancer is found in the lymph nodes, radiation with chemotherapy may be given.  Another option rarely used for cancers that are larger and quite extensive is a complete radical vulvectomy and removal of the groin lymph nodes.  If the lymph nodes are not removed because the patient is not healthy enough to have the surgery, radiation therapy may be given to the groin areas. If the lymph nodes are enlarged, a needle biopsy may be done before treatment to see if the nodes contain cancer cells.  Patients who are not healthy enough to have any surgery may be treated with just radiation therapy alone.  Stage II  Stage II cancers have spread to structures near the vulva, such as the anus, the lower vagina, and/or the lower  urethra. One option for treatment is partial radical vulvectomy (removal of the tumor, nearby parts of the vulva, and other tissues containing cancer). Surgery may also include removal of the lymph nodes in the groin on both sides of the body (or sentinel node biopsies). Radiation therapy may be given after surgery if cancer cells are at or near the margins (edges of the tissue removed by surgery).  For women who are too sick or weak from other medical problems to have surgery, radiation (with or without chemotherapy) may be used as the main treatment.  Stage III  Stage III cancers have spread to nearby lymph nodes . Treatment may include surgery to remove the cancer (either a radical wide local incision or partial or complete radical vulvectomy) and lymph nodes in the groin. This may be followed by radiation therapy . Sometimes chemotherapy (chemo) is given along with the radiation to help it work better.  These cancers may also be treated with radiation (with or without chemo) first, followed by surgery to remove any remaining cancer. This is often done to try to preserve normal structures such as the vagina, urethra and anus.  Radiation and chemo (without surgery) may be used as the main treatment for patients who cannot have surgery due to other medical problems.  Stage IVA  These cancers have spread more extensively to organs and tissues in the pelvis, such as the rectum (above the anus), the bladder, the pelvic bone, the upper part of the vagina, and the upper part of the urethra. When treated with surgery , the goal is to remove as much of the cancer as possible. The extent of the surgery  depends on what organs contain cancer cells. Pelvic exenteration is an option, but it's rarely used.  The standard approach is to combine surgery, radiation, and chemo. Radiation therapy may be done before or after surgery. Chemo may also be given before surgery.  Radiation and possibly chemo can also be given to women who can't have surgery because of other medical problems.  Stage IVA also includes tumors with less spread to nearby organs, but spread to nearby lymph nodes that has caused the lymph nodes to become fixed (stuck to the underlying tissue) or ulcerated (become open sores). These cancers are often treated with radical vulvectomy and removal of the groin lymph nodes . Radiation (often with chemo) may be given either before or after surgery.  Stage IVB  These cancers have spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis or to organs and tissues outside the pelvis (like the lungs or liver). There is no standard treatment for them. Surgery is not expected to cure these cancers, but may be helpful in relieving symptoms, such as bowel or bladder blockages. Radiation may also be helpful in shrinking the cancer and improving symptoms. Chemo may also be an option. Experts recommend that these women enroll in a clinical trial .  Recurrent vulvar cancer  When cancer comes back after treatment, it's called recurrent cancer . Treatment options depend on how soon the cancer comes back and whether the recurrence is local (in the vulva), regional (in nearby lymph nodes), or distant (has spread to organs such as the lungs or bones).  If the recurrence is local, it may still be possible to remove the cancer by surgery or by using combinations of chemo , radiation therapy , and surgery.  When the cancer has grown too large or spread too far to be surgically removed (it's unresectable), chemo and/or radiation therapy may be used to help relieve symptoms such as pain, or to shrink the tumor so that surgery may become an option. If treatment is given only to relieve pain or bleeding, it's called palliative (symptom relief) therapy.  It's very important to understand that palliative treatment is not expected to cure a cancer. Women with advanced vulvar cancer are encouraged to enter a clinical trial where they may get new treatments that might be helpful but are as yet unproven.

Author information 1 University of Miami, Jackson Memorial Hospital, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, 1611 NW 12 Avenue, East Tower, Room 3003, Miami, FL 33136, USA. Abstract Recurrent vulvar cancer occurs in an average of 24% of cases after primary treatment after surgery with or without radiation. The relatively few primary vulvar cancers, combined with the low proportion of recurrences, has made it difficult to perform randomized studies to document the most appropriate therapeutic modalities. Most reports are small retrospective studies and anecdotal reviews that have emphasized the importance of surgery and have led to new approaches with respect to chemoradiation. Traditionally, the most accepted treatment of vulvar cancer has been and continues to be surgery. Recently, radiation and chemotherapy have been combined with very encouraging results. The therapeutic modality used depends on the location and extent of the recurrence. Most recurrences occur locally near the original resection margins or at the ipsilateral inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes. Lateralized local vulvar recurrences treated with a wide radical local excision with inguinal lymphadectomy results in an excellent cure rate of 70%. With a central pelvic recurrence with antecedent radiotherapy involving the urethra, upper vagina, and rectum, total pelvic exenteration is indicated in a select group of patients with curative intent. Radiotherapy or chemoradiation concomitantly with wide radical local excision of an advanced vulvar has proven successful in avoiding an exenteration, with improved survival and less morbidity. Prospective and retrospective studies have shown excellent results using radiation or chemoradiation with wide radical local excision in patients with locally advanced disease in whom adequate resection margins are difficult to achieve (with a central lesion requiring exenteration) or with debilitating medical conditions that preclude surgery. In these patients, chemoradiation has shown favorable results when used before a wide local resection. In patients with advanced local disease, external beam and interstitial radiation has been used for palliative and curative intent with encouraging results. Regional recurrences to the inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes have been shown to have a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate. We recommend that inguinal recurrences without prior radiation therapy undergo excision followed by radiotherapy with chemosensitization. In patients with previous radiation to the inguinal lymph nodes, we try to avoid any excisional procedures because of the high rate of complications. We offer these patients brachytherapy for palliation. With pelvic recurrences, we recommended chemoradiation as the treatment modality. In the subset of patients with distant metastasis, chemotherapy may be offered; however, few studies have been performed to advocate any single combination. The literature supports the use of 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin as single agents or in combination to have sensitivity against squamous cells. There are few studies revealing improvement in 5-year survival, thus these patients may benefit from recruitment into research protocols.

Decisions about treatment of recurrent VSCC mainly depend on the location of the recurrence and previous treatment, resulting in individualized and consensus-based approaches. Most recurrences (40–80%) occur within 2 years after initial treatment. Currently, wide local excision is the treatment of choice for local recurrences. Isolated local recurrence of VSCC has a good prognosis, with reported 5-year survival rates of up to 60%. Groin recurrences and distant recurrences are less common and have an extremely poor prognosis. For groin recurrences, surgery with or without (chemo) radiotherapy is a treatment option, depending on prior treatment. For distant recurrences, there are only palliative treatment options. In this review, we give an overview of the available literature and discuss epidemiology, risk factors, and prognostic factors for the different types of recurrent VSCC and we describe treatment options and clinical outcome.

Return To Main Article :   Cancer of the Vulva  What Is A Recurrence?  A recurrence means that cancer has returned after the initial treatment. It can come back to the vulva or to another part of the body. There is no clear timeline as to what qualifies as a recurrence but there is a difference between recurrence and progression. A progression is where the original cancer continues to grow after treatment, although symptoms may not be immediately apparent. Recurrence is where the original cancer is considered ‘cleared’, and a new one has formed. If a woman undergoes vulva cancer treatment and cancer recurs after a few months, doctors will question - is it recurrence or was it ever really gone (progression)? It may be difficult to say. However there is a consensus among medical experts that if cancer comes back within 12 months of treatment, then it is progression and not recurrence. It may be that the original treatment was not completely successful and some tiny cancer cells remained behind but were too small to pick up by imaging and blood tests. Those cells then grow back and eventually cause symptoms to return. If cancer comes back after 12 months it is considered a recurrence. Most recurrences of cancer of the vulva occur within the first 2 years. See, also what does cancer remission mean?    What Is The Prognosis?  Vulva cancer survival rates give the statistical probability of a person surviving the disease. This is also known as prognosis or outcome. Vulva cancer returns in about 24 percent of women after primary treatment (although some studies indicate as few as 10 percent). The prognosis for the patient will depend on the extent of the recurrence and their overall general health and age. Very likely the woman will need to go through the vulva cancer diagnosis process again and her doctors will want to stage the tumor(s) (see vulva cancer staging ) so that they can learn as much as possible about it. One study by the Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Jackson Memorial Hospital (2002) reported an excellent cure rate (70 percent) for patients with local recurrences confined to the vulva area. The prognosis was not as fortunate for those with regional recurrences where cancer had spread to pelvic lymph nodes (higher mortality rates were reported). The sooner the recurrence is diagnosed, the better the prognosis. This is why follow-up care after primary (original) treatment is so important.    What Are The Signs Of A Recurrence?  The symptoms will depend on what stage of cancer is present. Some patients may even be asymptomatic (no symptoms) and the first warning sign could be elevated levels of CA 125 found in a blood test. Most women who undergo cancer treatments will have their blood checked regularly afterwards for the tumor marker CA 125. Rising levels can indicate the return of a tumor. If a recurrence is local, then any of the following symptoms of vulva cancer can return:  • Changes in the texture or color of the vulva skin. • Persistent itching of the vulva. • Burning sensation when passing urine. • White raised patches of skin or warts on the vulva. • An ulceration or sore that will not heal.  Advanced Stages  Most patients with advanced stages of the disease will experience pain that can significantly reduce their quality of life. Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is sudden and does not last; once the cause of the pain is identified it can usually be successfully managed. Chronic pain on the other hand is persistent and normally lasts longer than 3 months. This sort of pain can be caused by the progression of the disease or the result of treatment. It may cause depression and insomnia. How pain affects a patient will depend on a number of factors including their personal threshold for pain, their age, general health and past experiences with pain.  How Is It Treated?  As primary vulvar cancers are so rare, and recurrences even rarer, large-scale studies into optimal treatment methods are difficult. Most studies for this reason are small – but they have reported anecdotal successes in the use of cancer surgery and more lately chemoradiation. Which treatment is used depends on a number of factors including the extent of the cancer, symptoms present and what treatment the patient received in the past. Surgery continues to be the main form of treatment but it may be combined with either radiation therapy and/or chemo (see chemotherapy guide ). The treatment options are:   • Wide local excision with/without radiation therapy. • Radical vulvectomy combined with pelvic exenteration. • Radiation therapy and chemo, applied in the same time period. With/without surgery. • Radiation therapy followed by chemo or surgery. • Palliative radiation therapy to help relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. • Participation in cancer clinical trials to try experimental treatments.  Most recurrences are local which means they can be treated with wide local excision (cutting out the tumor) and inguinal lymphadectomy (removal of lymph nodes). See vulva cancer treatment for more details on these procedures. The cure rate is normally about 70 percent. In rare cases, advanced cancer may be treated by radical vulvectomy and pelvic exenteration.  This can mean the removal of the vulva, vagina and cervix as well as the lower colon, bladder or rectum. As this is such a radical procedure doctors will always try to look for other possible treatments first. The use of radiotherapy and chemoradiation combined with radical local excision has had some success in avoiding the necessity of pelvic exenteration and has led to better survival rates (a 5 year survival rate greater than 50 percent).  If doctors feel the patient is not a candidate for surgery (possibly due to previous treatments or advanced age), they may recommend the use of radiotherapy, possibly followed by chemotherapy. Patients with metastatic disease (which has spread to distant parts of the body) may be offered radiation therapy for palliative reasons. As there is no standard chemotherapy or systemic treatment for metastatic vulva cancer, such women should consider clinical trials. A few studies indicate an improvement  in their 5 year survival rate by doing so. Metastatic cancer, while a very serious diagnosis, is viewed by  progressive doctors as a 'chronic disease' which may be possible to manage. Patients can undergo treatment and experience periods of remission and their quality of life can be good throughout.  Interesting: Read about Vulva cancer prevention .

It may come back in the vulva or elsewhere in the body. Although tumors may appear in distant sites, it is not a new cancer. It is a recurrence of the original cancer.  If you have recurrent vulvar cancer, SCCA can offer you new medical procedures and treatments, as well as access to clinical trials, that your community doctor may not know about. No one at SCCA will tell you that a diagnosis of recurrent disease is not serious, but there is hope.  The treatment you receive for a recurrence of your vulvar cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation--or a combination of these treatments. Your treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the type of treatment you have received in the past, and the symptoms you are experiencing with the new cancer. Depending on the extent of the disease, your doctors may recommend that you have a wide local excision, which may be followed by radiation therapy. Rarely, you may need a more extensive surgery, called pelvic exenteration. In this procedure, the uterus, cervix, and vagina are removed, as well as other organs to which the cancer has spread, such as the lower colon, rectum, or bladder. If your doctors feel that surgery is not appropriate for you, they may recommend that you have radiation therapy, possibly in combination with chemotherapy, or alone. Radiation therapy is used for local recurrences and also to reduce symptoms of recurrent disease. Ask your doctor about taking part in clinical trials of promising treatments for recurrent disease. Living With Metastatic Disease Any person who has faced cancer lives with the fear that cancer will return. And the first response many people have to the news of metastases is to fear that they will soon die. If you have metastatic disease, you will learn a new definition of metastatic cancer—"a chronic disease that can be managed." It's a very different way of looking at cancer. You can expect to have periods of treatment, followed by periods of remission, with a fairly good quality of life throughout. Emotionally, this can be tough. You may want to talk with a chaplain or social worker or join a support group . SCCA has several support groups for patients and for caregivers and family members.

Use the menu to see other pages.  This section tells you the treatments that are the standard of care for this type of cancer. “Standard of care” means the best treatments known. When making treatment plan decisions, patients may be encouraged to consider clinical trials as an option. A clinical trial is a research study that tests a new approach to treatment. Doctors want to learn whether the new treatment is safe, effective, and possibly better than the standard treatment. Clinical trials can test a new drug, a new combination of standard treatments, or new doses of standard drugs or other treatments. Your doctor can help you consider all your treatment options. To learn more about clinical trials, see the About Clinical Trials and Latest Research sections.  Treatment overview  In cancer care, different types of doctors often work together to create a patient’s overall treatment plan that combines different types of treatments. This is called a multidisciplinary team . Cancer care teams include a variety of other health care professionals, such as physician assistants, oncology nurses, social workers, pharmacists, counselors, dietitians, and others.  Treatment options and recommendations for vulvar cancer depend on several factors, including:   The type and stage of cancer    Possible side effects    The patient’s preferences and overall health   Your care plan may include treatment for symptoms and side effects, an important part of cancer care. Take time to learn about all of your treatment options and be sure to ask questions about things that are unclear. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment and what you can expect while receiving the treatment. Learn more about making treatment decisions .  Treatment overview for VIN  As explained in the Introduction , VIN is a precancerous condition. VIN is usually treated by simple surgical removal of the disease. The treatment plan may also include laser surgery and/or medication(s) applied to the vulva area. If the VIN is extensive, a partial (not radical) and superficial (only the removal of the skin without removing the fatty tissues beneath the skin) surgical removal of the vulva may be recommended. See below for more information on each of these treatment options.  Treatment overview for vulvar cancer  The main treatment for vulvar cancer is surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used if the cancer cannot be entirely removed with surgery, if the cancer has a high risk for recurrence, and/or if the lymph nodes are involved with cancer.  If the tumor has spread to the point that initial surgical removal is not possible, sometimes the patient’s treatment plan starts with radiation therapy, often with simultaneous low-dose chemotherapy given weekly during the radiation treatments. Surgical removal of the vulvar lesion sometimes considered if the entire tumor does not go away after these treatments.  Women with vulvar cancer may have concerns about if and how these treatments may affect their sexual function and fertility (ability to have children). These topics are important and should be discussed with the health care team before treatment begins.  Surgery  Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. A gynecologic oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating gynecologic cancer using surgery. Due to the location and sensitivity of vulvar tissue, the type of surgery is carefully considered.  Surgical options for invasive vulvar cancer include the removal of part or all of the vulva, depending on the size and spread of the primary tumor. This is called a vulvectomy.  Vulvectomy. Different vulvectomy approaches to treat invasive vulvar cancer include:   Radical local excision of the vulva. This surgery is done to remove the tumor and a large amount of tissue around it, called a margin. It is used for most primary tumors that are less than 4 centimeters (cm) in diameter and are either stage I or stage II disease.    Modified radical vulvectomy. This term describes a surgical procedure in which less than the full vulva is removed. For example, in a radical hemivulvectomy , only one side of the vulva is removed.    Radical vulvectomy. A radical vulvectomy is the removal of part or all of the vulva, along with the underlying deep tissue. This is a very uncommon operation because most vulvectomies are modified in some way, and very large tumors are usually treated with chemoradiation, as described below.   Laser surgery is the use of a focused beam of light that vaporizes a premalignant skin lesion. It cannot be used to treat an invasive tumor .  Lymphadenectomy. As explained in Diagnosis , this is a surgical procedure to remove lymph nodes in the groin in order to check for cancer.  Learn more about the basics of cancer surgery .  Coping with vulvar surgery  Many women experience a range of emotions after vulvar surgery, such as loss, sadness, or anxiety. Some women may feel that they have lost their identity as women. Others have questions about whether sexual intercourse can continue after surgery. Women may also worry about how the surgery will affect their relationships with their partners.  Before surgery, it is important to talk with the surgeon about the procedure, the possible side effects, and when sexual intercourse can begin again. Women should talk with their doctors about finding additional information or support in coping with this type of surgery. Learn more about sexual health and cancer treatment in women .  Chemoradiation therapy for advanced-stage vulvar cancers  For very large vulvar tumors, radiation therapy is often combined with concurrent  low-dose chemotherapy  before surgery  to shrink the tumor to avoid removing the entire vulva and to decrease how much tissue is removed. This is called chemoradiation therapy. The chemotherapy is given at the same time as the radiation therapy. This treatment option is particularly important when the tumor involves the urethra or anus so that urinary and bowel function can be preserved. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are explained in detail below.  Radiation therapy  Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-rays or other particles to destroy cancer cells. A doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer is called a radiation oncologist. Radiation therapy may be used before surgery to shrink the size of the tumor or after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells.  The most common type of radiation treatment is called external-bean radiation therapy, which is radiation given from a machine outside the body. When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. A radiation therapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time. Learn more about the basics of radiation therapy .  General side effects from radiation therapy may include fatigue, mild to severe skin reactions, upset stomach and loose bowel movements, damage to healthy vaginal tissue, or narrowing of the vagina. Most of these side effects go away soon after treatment is finished. However, the vagina may shorten and narrow so much that sexual intercourse is not possible. To prevent this, the vagina may need to be stretched with a plastic tube called a vaginal dilator several times a week.  For more information about radiation therapy for gynecologic cancer, see the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology's pamphlet, Radiation Therapy for Gynecologic Cancers .  Chemotherapy  Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells, usually by ending the cancer cells’ ability to grow and divide. Chemotherapy is given by a gynecologic oncologist or medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with medication.  Systemic chemotherapy gets into the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body. Common ways to give chemotherapy include an intravenous (IV) tube placed into a vein using a needle or in a pill or capsule that is swallowed.  A chemotherapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time. A patient may receive 1 drug at a time or combinations of different drugs given at the same time.  If the patient is to receive external radiation therapy for locally spread vulvar cancer, chemotherapy with cisplatin (Platinol) is sometimes given intravenously every week at the same time as the radiation therapy.  If the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis or has recurred, doctors sometimes consider using drugs that are used to treat cervical cancer and vaginal cancer , which are other HPV-induced squamous cell gynecologic cancers.  For metastatic vulvar cancer, patients are most often treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy, typically carboplatin (Paraplatin) and paclitaxel (Taxol). Sometimes bevacizumab (Avastin) is added to this combination.  The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the individual and the drugs and doses used. They can include fatigue, risk of infection, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite, or diarrhea. These side effects usually go away after treatment is finished.  Whether these drugs are used depends on the patient’s overall health, their kidney function measured as by laboratory tests, and other medical factors.  Learn more about the basics of chemotherapy and preparing for treatment . The medications used to treat cancer are continually being evaluated. Talking with your doctor is often the best way to learn about the medications prescribed for you, their purpose, and their potential side effects or interactions with other medications. Learn more about your prescriptions by using searchable drug databases .  Getting care for symptoms and side effects  Cancer and its treatment often cause side effects. In addition to treatments intended to slow, stop, or eliminate the cancer, an important part of cancer care is relieving a person’s symptoms and side effects. This approach is called palliative or supportive care, and it includes supporting the patient with his or her physical, emotional, and social needs.  Palliative care is any treatment that focuses on reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and supporting patients and their families . Any person, regardless of age or type and stage of cancer, may receive palliative care. It works best when palliative care is started as early as needed in the cancer treatment process.  People often receive treatment for the cancer at the same time they receive treatment to ease side effects, including topical treatments applied to the skin, such as creams, to relieve symptoms like itching and burning. Patients who receive both at the same time often have less severe symptoms, better quality of life, and report they are more satisfied with treatment.  Palliative treatments vary widely and often include medication, nutritional changes, relaxation techniques, emotional support and other therapies. You may also receive palliative treatments similar to those meant to eliminate the cancer, such as chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation therapy. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment in the treatment plan.  Before treatment begins, talk with your health care team about the possible side effects of your specific treatment plan and palliative care options. During and after treatment, be sure to tell your doctor or another health care team member if you are experiencing a problem so it can be addressed as quickly as possible.  Learn more about palliative care .  Metastatic vulvar cancer  If cancer spreads to another part in the body from where it started, doctors call it metastatic cancer. In these situations, chemotherapy may be recommended. The drugs that are used to treat most metastatic vulvar cancer are typically the same as those used for metastatic cervical cancer .  It is a good idea to talk with doctors who have experience in treating metastatic vulvar cancer, such as a gynecologic oncologist. Doctors can have different opinions about the best standard treatment plan. Also, clinical trials might be an option. Learn more about getting a second opinion before starting treatment, so you are comfortable with your chosen treatment plan.  Your treatment plan may include a combination of the treatments discussed above. Palliative care will also be important to help relieve symptoms and side effects.  For most patients, a diagnosis of metastatic cancer is very stressful and, at times, difficult to bear. Patients and their families are encouraged to talk about the way they are feeling with doctors, nurses, social workers, or other members of the health care team. It may also be helpful to talk with other patients, including through a support group.  Remission and the chance of recurrence  A remission is when cancer cannot be detected in the body and there are no symptoms. This may also be called having “no evidence of disease” or NED.  A remission may be temporary or permanent. This uncertainty causes many people to worry that the cancer will come back. While many remissions are permanent, it is important to talk with your doctor about the possibility of the cancer returning and what will be done to watch for a recurrence (see “Watching for recurrence” in Follow-up Care ). Understanding your risk of recurrence and the treatment options may help you feel more prepared if the cancer does return. Learn more about coping with the fear of recurrence .  If the cancer does return after the original treatment, it is called recurrent cancer . It may come back in the same place (called a local recurrence), nearby (regional recurrence), or in another place (distant recurrence).  When this occurs, a new cycle of testing will begin to learn as much as possible about the recurrence. After this testing is done, you and your doctor will talk about your treatment options. Often the treatment plan will include the treatments described above, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, but they may be used in a different combination or given at a different pace. Your doctor may suggest clinical trials that are studying new ways to treat this type of recurrent cancer.  Whichever treatment plan you choose, palliative care will be important for relieving symptoms and side effects.  People with recurrent cancer often experience emotions such as disbelief or fear. Patients are encouraged to talk with their health care team about these feelings and ask about support services to help them cope. Learn more about dealing with cancer recurrence .  If treatment fails  Recovery from cancer is not always possible. If the cancer cannot be cured or controlled, the disease may be called advanced or terminal.  This diagnosis is stressful, and advanced cancer is difficult to discuss for many people. However, it is important to have open and honest conversations with your doctor and health care team to express your feelings, preferences, and concerns. The health care team is there to help, and many team members have special skills, experience, and knowledge to support patients and their families. Making sure a person is physically comfortable and free from pain is extremely important.  Patients who have advanced cancer and who are expected to live less than 6 months may want to consider a type of palliative care called hospice care. Hospice care is designed to provide the best possible quality of life for people who are near the end of life. Patients may consider staying at home instead of in a different or facility-based environment. You and your family are encouraged to think about where you would be most comfortable: at home, in the hospital, or in a hospice environment. Nursing care and special equipment can make staying at home a workable alternative for many families. Learn more about advanced cancer care planning .

You will also read information about surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 6,190 women in the United States will be diagnosed with vulvar cancer. Its incidence is increasing in young women because of its association with the human papillomavirus (HPV). See the Risk Factors and Prevention section for more information on HPV.  It is estimated that 1,200 deaths from this disease will occur this year.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of women live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. Survival rates depend on several factors, including the type of vulvar cancer and the stage of disease at the time it is diagnosed.  If cancer is found at the earliest stage before it has spread, the 5-year survival rate is 86%. If the cancer has only spread to nearby lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is 54%. If it is found after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 16%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for women with this type of cancer are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of women with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. Women should talk with their doctor if they have any questions about this information.

All rights reserved worldwide                     Vulvar Cancer Recurrence  Cancer » Vulvar Cancer » Vulvar Cancer Recurrence The vulvar cancer recurrence should be detected by the patients as early as possible. The cancer recurrence often takes place if the tumor has spread to the other parts of the body. The vulvar cancer usually consists of two types, the primary vulvar cancer and the secondary vulvar cancer. The primary vulvar cancer develops in the vulva itself and may spread to other parts of the body. The secondary vulvar cancer develops in parts other than the vulva. Even if the tumor appears in other parts of the body, it is not a new cancer. It is recurrence of the original cancer.     According to statastics of vulvar cancer , near about 4340 patients will be diagnosed. If the vulvar cancer is not diagnosed during its initial stages, there are chances of the cancer to spread. During diagnosis, the vulva and area around it is searched for the tumor. There are many ways used to detect vulvar cancer. They are as follows:  Biopsy Pelvic Exam Cystoscopy Proctoscopy X-rays Intravenous pyelogram CT scan Magnetic resonance Imaging  After these tests are thoroughly performed, the detection of tumor is located. This helps to plan the treatment. If the cancer is in its early stage it's simple to operate. The chances of recurrence of the cancer are also less. But if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it's difficult to operate and the chances of recurrence are also high. The treatment of the vulvar cancer mainly depends on the site and extent of recurrence. It also depends on the type of treatment patient has received in the past and symptoms experienced due to new cancer. The treatments given to the patients with recurrence of vulvar cancer are as follows:  Radical Excision : This procedure is used to remove a tumor and large amount of normal tissue surrounding it. In this surgery, lymph nodes may also be removed. Radical excision may result in long term pain relief and also helps to prevent cancer recurrence. Palliative Radiation Therapy : Palliative therapy can also be called as comport care. It is basically used for the cancer treatment where long term cancer control is not possible. When local recurrence occurs after two years of primary treatment, a combination of surgery and radiation therapy is done. It may result in 5 year survival rate of vulva cancer . Radiation therapy is often suggested when doctors feel that surgery is not appropriate for the patient. It is used for local recurrence and to reduce symptoms of vulvar cancer . After diagnosis, according to the extent of the disease, doctors may recommend the patient to have a wide local excision followed by radiation therapy. This vulver cancer therapy is often used for patients having local recurrence. If the recurrence is detected in the later stages of the cancer, you may need a more extensive surgery, called pelvic exenteration. During this surgery, the cervix, vagina and the uterus are treated. If the cancer has spread to other parts like rectum, lower colon or bladder, they are treated as well. Synchronous radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy is also an option for the treatment of vulvar cancer recurrence. Adjuvant therapy is also used. In this therapy, chemotherapy or radiation therapy are performed after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.  Treating vulvar cancer recurrence is same as treating vulvar cancer. After diagnosis, the exact stage is detected and following treatments are given:  Laser Therapy : In this therapy, laser beams are used to kill the cancer cells. Surgery : Surgery is done to remove cancer without any loss to patient's sexual functions. There are different types of surgery performed as follows:  Wide local excision Radical local excision Vulvectomy Pelvic exenteration  Radiation Therapy : High energy x-rays are used during this treatment. There are two types of radiation therapy, external and internal radiation therapy. They are used depending upon the stage of the cancer. Chemotherapy : Drugs are used during this treatment to stop the growth of cancer cells.  Patients should not get depressed after vulvar cancer recurrence. Different therapies and treatments are available to cure the disease and give relief. New types of treatment are also invented which help cure the disease effectively.

Vulvar cancer is cancer that starts in the vulva. This is the outer part of the female
      reproductive system. This is also called the external genitalia.  The vulva includes the mons pubis. This is the rounded area in front of the pubic
      bones that becomes covered with hair at puberty. It also includes the skin folds under
      the pubic hair that protect the opening of the urethra (the tube that carries urine
      out of the body) and the vagina.  The vulva has two folds of skin. The outer folds are called the labia majora. The
      inner folds are called the labia minora.  The inner folds of the vulva form a hood of skin called the prepuce or the hood of
      the clitoris. Below the prepuce is the clitoris. The clitoris is a sensitive piece
      of tissue that swells with blood when stimulated.  At the bottom of the inner folds of the vulva is the fourchette. This is where the
      labia minora meet. Below the fourchette is the perineum. This is also part of the
      vulva. The perineum ends at the anus. The anus is where stool leaves the body.  Vulvar cancer is rare. It only accounts for about 4 percent of all female reproductive
      organ cancers. If it’s found in its early stages, vulvar cancer is highly curable.
      Fortunately, most cases are diagnosed in the earlier stages.  Who gets vulvar cancer?  According to the American Cancer Society, about 5,950 women will be diagnosed with
      vulvar cancer in the U.S. in 2016. Most women with vulvar cancer are older than 50
      years. More than half are older than 70 years at the time they learn they have cancer.  Who is at risk for vulvar cancer?  Certain factors can make women more likely to get vulvar cancer. These are called
      risk factors. Just because a woman has one or more risk factors does not mean she
      will get vulvar cancer. In fact, a woman can have all of the risk factors and still
      not get the disease. Or, a woman can have no known risk factors and get vulvar cancer.
      Experts aren’t exactly sure what causes vulvar cancer. However, possible risk factors
      can include:    Age. Women older than 50 years are more at risk for squamous cell carcinoma. This
            is the most common type of vulvar cancer.    Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a group of viruses that can cause genital
            warts. HPV has been linked to certain cancers. Women infected with certain types of
            HPV may be more at risk for vulvar cancer.    Smoking. Smoking increases your risk for vulvar cancer. If you smoke and have been
            infected with a high-risk strain of HPV, you’re at an even greater risk for vulvar
            cancer.    Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). This condition causes a change in the cells
            on the surface of the vulva. Women with VIN may be more likely to get vulvar cancer.    Lichen sclerosus. Women with this condition have vulvar skin that’s itchy and thin.
            These women are at a slightly higher risk of getting vulvar cancer.    Family history of melanoma. Women with a family history of melanoma or atypical moles
            have a higher risk of getting a melanoma of the vulva.    Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Women with HIV are more at risk for
            vulvar cancer.    History of cervical cancer. Having cervical cancer is linked with a higher risk for
            vulvar cancer. The two types of cancer share some risk factors. These include having
            certain types of HPV infections and smoking.    Immunosuppression. Women whose immune system is weakened are at higher risk of vulvar
            cancer. This may include women with HIV. It may also include women who have had a
            transplant and are taking medicine to prevent rejection.    What are the symptoms of vulvar cancer?  A woman can have vulvar cancer without having any symptoms. Note that some symptoms
      of vulvar cancer are similar to the symptoms of VIN. Symptoms of vulvar cancer can
      include:    Vulvar itching that does not improve    Change in skin color or feel of vulva    Red, white, or wart-like bump or sore on the vulva    Pain when urinating    Burning or bleeding and discharge that’s not related to the menstrual cycle    Enlarged glands (lymph nodes) in the groin    A new mole on the vulva or a change in a mole's size or appearance, including irregular
            color or borders    An ulcer or cracking of the vulvar skin that does not heal    How is vulvar cancer diagnosed?  If you have symptoms of vulvar cancer, see your healthcare provider. He or she may
      do the following:    Clinical history and physical exam. Your healthcare provider will ask questions to
            learn about your symptoms, personal and family history, and risk factors. A thorough
            physical exam includes a pelvic exam and a Pap test. These can also help rule out
            other problems.    HPV test. Your healthcare provider can test for HPV at the same time as a Pap test.    Colposcopy of the vulva. For this test, your healthcare provider uses a tool called
            a colposcope. This tool magnifies cells on the surface of the cervix, vagina, and
            vulva. It allows your healthcare provider to select suspicious looking spots of tissue
            to remove and examine. This is called a biopsy.    Biopsy. Your healthcare provider may take a small piece of tissue from the vulva.
            A pathologist looks at it under a microscope to check for cancer cells.    How is vulvar cancer treated?  Your treatment depends on the type of vulvar cancer you have. It also depends on the
      results of lab tests and the stage or extent of the cancer. Your healthcare provider
      will also consider your age and general health when making treatment recommendations.
      The most common ways to treat vulvar cancer are with surgery and/or radiation. You
      may also need chemotherapy.  Should everyone get a second opinion for vulvar cancer?  Many people with cancer get a second opinion from another healthcare provider. There
      are many reasons to get a second opinion. Here are some of those reasons:    Not feeling comfortable with the treatment decision    Being diagnosed with an invasive or rare type of vulvar cancer    Having several options for how to treat the cancer    Not being able to see a cancer expert    It may help to have a second healthcare provider review the diagnosis and treatment
      options before starting treatment. Gynecologic oncologists are doctors with advanced
      training in the diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of female cancers. These include
      vulvar cancer. Know that, in most cases, a short delay in treatment will not lower
      the chance that it will work. Some health insurance companies even require that a
      person with cancer seek a second opinion. Many companies will pay for a second opinion.  How can I get a second opinion for vulvar cancer?  There are many ways to get a second opinion:    Ask a primary care healthcare provider. He or she may be able to recommend a specialist.
            These can include a gynecologic oncologist, medical oncologist, or radiation oncologist.
            Sometimes these doctors work together at cancer centers or programs.    Call the Foundation for Women's Cancer. The number is 312-578-1439 They can help callers
            find a gynecologic oncologist for a second opinion. Or use the Find a Gynecologic Oncologist tool at their website to search for a gynecologic oncologist by zip code. You can also find one at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology .    Call the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service. The number is 800-4-CANCER
            (800-422-6237). They have information about treatment facilities, including cancer
            centers and other programs supported by the National Cancer Institute.    Seek other options. Check with a local medical society, a nearby hospital, a medical
            school, or local cancer advocacy groups. Or talk with other women who've had vulvar
            cancer to get names of specialists who can give you a second opinion.    What are clinical trials?  Clinical trials are studies of new kinds of cancer treatments. Experts use clinical
      trials to learn how well new treatments work and what their side effects are. Promising
      treatments are ones that work better or have fewer side effects than the current treatments.
      People who participate in these studies get to use treatments before the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) approves them. People who join trials also help researchers
      learn more about cancer and help future cancer patients. There is a large searchable
      database at www.clinicaltrials.gov where you can see what trials might be available
      for you.

Vulvar Cancer  Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention             Risk Factors for Vulvar Cancer       A risk factor is anything that changes a person's chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. For example, exposing skin to strong sunlight is a risk factor for skin cancer. Smoking is a risk factor for many cancers.  There are different kinds of risk factors. Some, such as your age or race, can’t be changed. Others may be related to personal choices such as smoking, drinking, or diet. Some factors influence risk more than others. But risk factors don't tell us everything. Having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that a person will get the disease. Also, not having any risk factors doesn't mean that you won't get it, either.  Although several risk factors increase the odds of developing vulvar cancer, most women with these risks do not develop it. And some women who don’t have any apparent risk factors develop vulvar cancer. When a woman develops vulvar cancer, it is usually not possible to say with certainty that a particular risk factor was the cause.  Age  The risk of vulvar cancer goes up as women age. Less than 20% of cases are in women younger than age 50, and more than half occur in women over age 70. The average age of women diagnosed with invasive vulvar cancer is 70, whereas women diagnosed with non-invasive vulvar cancer average about 20 years younger.  Human papillomavirus  HPV stands for human papilloma v irus . HPVs are a large group of related viruses. They are called papillomaviruses because some of them cause a type of growth called a papilloma . Papillomas — more commonly known as warts — are not cancers. Different HPV types can cause different types of warts in different parts of the body. Some types cause common warts on the hands and feet. Other types tend to cause warts on the lips or tongue.  Certain HPV types can infect the outer female and male genital organs and the anal area, causing raised, bumpy warts. These warts may barely be visible or they may be several inches across. The medical term for genital warts is condyloma acuminatum .  Two types of HPV (HPV 6 and HPV 11) cause most cases of genital warts, but are seldom linked to cancer and are known as low-risk HPV.  Other HPV types have been linked with cancers of the cervix , vagina , and vulva in women, cancer of the penis in men, and cancers of the anus and throat (in men and women). These are known as high-risk types of HPV and include HPV 16 and  HPV 18 as well as others. Infection with a high-risk HPV may produce no visible signs until pre-cancerous changes or cancer develops.  HPV can  pass from one person to another during skin-to-skin contact. One way HPV is spread is through sexual activity, including vaginal and anal intercourse and even oral sex.  Some doctors think there are 2 kinds of vulvar cancer. One kind is associated with HPV infection (more than half of all vulvar cancers are linked to infection with the high-risk HPV types) and tends to occur in younger women. The other is not associated with HPV infection, is more often found in older women, and may develop from a precursor lesion called differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (discussed below).  Vaccines have been developed to help prevent infection with some types of HPV.  For more about HPV, see HPV (Human Papillomavirus) .  Smoking  Smoking exposes people to many cancer-causing chemicals that affect more than their lungs. These harmful substances can be absorbed into the lining of the lungs and spread throughout the body. Smoking increases the risk of developing vulvar cancer. Among women who have a history of HPV infection, smoking further increases the risk of developing vulvar cancer. If women are infected with a high-risk HPV, they have a much higher risk of developing vulvar cancer if they smoke.  HIV infection  HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Because this virus damages the immune system, it makes women more likely to get and to stay infected with HPV. This could increase the risk of vulvar pre-cancer and cancer. Scientists also believe that the immune system plays a role in destroying cancer cells and slowing their growth and spread.  Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)  Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva usually forms slowly over many years. Pre-cancerous changes often occur first and can last for several years. The medical term most often used for this pre-cancerous condition is vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia  (VIN). Intraepithelial means that the abnormal cells are only found in the surface layer of the vulvar skin (epithelium).  VIN is typed by how the lesions and cells look: usual-type VIN and differentiated-type VIN . It is sometimes graded VIN2 and VIN3, with the number 3 indicating furthest progression toward a true cancer. However, many doctors use only one grade of VIN.   Usual-type VIN occurs in younger women and is caused by HPV infection. When usual-type VIN changes into invasive squamous cell cancer, it becomes the basaloid or warty subtypes.  Differentiated-type VIN tends to occur in older women and is not linked to HPV infection. It can progress to the keratinizing subtype of invasive squamous cell cancer.   In the past, the term  dysplasia was used instead of VIN, but this term is used much less often now. When talking about dysplasia, there is also a range of increasing progress toward cancer -- first, mild dysplasia; next, moderate dysplasia; then severe dysplasia; and, finally, carcinoma in situ.  Although women with VIN have an increased risk of developing invasive vulvar cancer, most cases of VIN never progress to cancer. Still, since it is not possible to tell which cases will become cancers, treatment or close medical follow-up is needed.  The risk of progression to cancer seems to be highest with VIN3 and lower with VIN2. This risk can be altered with treatment. In one study, 88% of untreated VIN3 progressed to cancer, but of the women who were treated, only 4% developed vulvar cancer.  In the past, cases of VIN were included in the broad category of disorders known as vulvar dystrophy . Since this category included a wide variety of other diseases, most of which are not pre-cancerous, most doctors no longer use this term.  Lichen sclerosus  This disorder, also called lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA), causes the vulvar skin to become very thin and itchy. The risk of vulvar cancer appears to be slightly increased by LSA, with about 4% of women having LSA later developing vulvar cancer.  Other genital cancers  Women with cervical cancer also have a higher risk of vulvar cancer. This is probably because these cancers share certain risk factors. The same HPV types that are linked to cervical cancer are also linked to vulvar cancer. Smoking is also linked to a higher risk of both cervical and vulvar cancers.  Melanoma or atypical moles  Women who have had melanoma or dysplastic nevi (atypical moles) in other places have an increased risk of developing a melanoma on the vulva. A family history of melanoma also leads to an increased risk.

You will also read information about surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 6,190 women in the United States will be diagnosed with vulvar cancer. Its incidence is increasing in young women because of its association with the human papillomavirus (HPV). See the Risk Factors and Prevention section for more information on HPV.  It is estimated that 1,200 deaths from this disease will occur this year.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of women live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. Survival rates depend on several factors, including the type of vulvar cancer and the stage of disease at the time it is diagnosed.  If cancer is found at the earliest stage before it has spread, the 5-year survival rate is 86%. If the cancer has only spread to nearby lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is 54%. If it is found after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 16%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for women with this type of cancer are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of women with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. Women should talk with their doctor if they have any questions about this information.

The end of treatment can be both stressful and exciting. You may be relieved to finish treatment, but yet it’s hard not to worry about cancer coming back. This is very common if you’ve had cancer.  For others , the cancer might never go away completely. Some people may get  treatments  to try and help keep the cancer in check or ease problems it's causing. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful.  Life after vulvar cancer means returning to some familiar things and also making some new choices.  Follow-up care  When treatment ends, your doctors will still want to watch you closely. It's very important to go to all of your follow-up appointments. During these visits, your doctors will ask questions about any problems you may have and may do exams and lab tests or x-rays and scans to look for signs of cancer or treatment side effects. Almost any cancer treatment can have side effects . Some may last for a few weeks to months, but others can last the rest of your life. This is the time for you to talk to your cancer care team about any changes or problems you notice and any questions or concerns you have.  Lymphedema is a common side effect when lymph nodes are removed as part of surgery for vulvar cancer. Your doctor will talk to you about lymphedema and what you can do to try to keep it from starting . 
    Be sure to tell your doctor about any swelling, heaviness, pain, or skin changes you notice in your genitals or your legs.  Ask your doctor for a survivorship care plan  Talk with your doctor about developing a survivorship care plan for you. This plan might include:   A suggested schedule for follow-up exams and tests  A schedule for other tests you might need in the future, such as early detection (screening) tests for other types of cancer, or tests to look for long-term health effects from your cancer or its treatment  A list of possible late- or long-term side effects from your treatment, including what to watch for and when you should contact your doctor  Diet and physical activity suggestions  Reminders to keep your appointments with your primary care provider (PCP), who will monitor your general health care   Keeping health insurance and copies of your medical records  Even after treatment, it’s very important to keep health insurance. Tests and doctor visits cost a lot, and even though no one wants to think of their cancer coming back, this could happen.  At some point after your cancer treatment, you might find yourself seeing a new doctor who doesn’t know about your medical history. It’s important to keep copies of your medical records to give your new doctor the details of your diagnosis and treatment. Learn more in Keeping Copies of Important Medical Records .  Can I lower my risk of vulvar  cancer progressing or coming back?  If you have (or have had) vulvar cancer, you probably want to know if there are things you can do that might lower your risk of the cancer growing or coming back, such as exercising, eating a certain type of diet, or taking nutritional supplements. Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear if there are things you can do that will help.  Adopting healthy behaviors such as not smoking , eating well , getting regular physical activity , and staying at a healthy weight might help, but no one knows for sure. However, we do know that these types of changes can have positive effects on your health that can extend beyond your risk of vulvar  cancer or other cancers.  About dietary supplements  So far, no dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbal products) have been shown to clearly help lower the risk of vulvar  cancer progressing or coming back. This doesn’t mean that no supplements will help, but it’s important to know that none have been proven to do so.  Dietary supplements are not regulated like medicines in the United States – they do not have to be proven effective (or even safe) before being sold, although there are limits on what they’re allowed to claim they can do. If you’re thinking about taking any type of nutritional supplement, talk to your health care team. They can help you decide which ones you can use safely while avoiding those that might be harmful.  If the cancer comes back  If the cancer does recur at some point, your treatment options will depend on where the cancer is located, what treatments you’ve had before, and your overall health. For general information on recurrence, you may want to see Understanding Recurrence .  Could I get a second cancer after treatment?  Women who’ve had vulvar  cancer can still get other cancers. In fact, vulvar cancer survivors are at higher risk for getting some other types of cancer. Learn more in ﻿﻿ Second Cancers After Vulvar Cancer .  Getting emotional support  Some  feelings of depression, anxiety, or worriy are normal when cancer is a part of your life. Some people are affected more than others. But everyone can benefit from help and support from other people, whether friends and family, religious groups, support groups, professional counselors, or others.

Other factors that affect this decision include the exact location of the cancer on the vulva, the type of vulvar cancer , your age, your preferences, and your overall health.  Because vulvar cancer is rare, it's hard to study it well. Most experts agree that treatment in a clinical trial should be considered. This way women can get the best treatment available now and may also get the treatments that are thought to be even better.  Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)  Treatment options for carcinoma in situ and for small pre-cancerous changes ( vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia , or VIN) are the same. If left untreated, nearly all will progress to invasive vulvar cancer. Surgery , such as laser surgery, wide local excision, or a skinning vulvectomy may be used, depending on the size and location of the cancer. A topical therapy such as fluorouracil (5-FU) ointment or imiquimod cream may be applied to the abnormal areas. Even if treated, stage 0 cancers may recur (come back) or new stage 0 cancers may form on other areas of the vulva, so good follow-up care is important.  Stage I  Treatment options depend on the size and depth of the cancer and whether the patient also has VIN. If the depth of invasion is 1 mm or less (stage IA) and there are no other areas of cancer or VIN, the cancer is surgically removed along with a 1 cm (less than half an inch) rim (margin) of normal tissue around it.  For stage IB cancers, treatment may include a partial radical vulvectomy and inguinal lymph node dissection (removal of nearby groin lymph nodes). Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done instead of the lymph node dissection. If cancer is found in the lymph nodes, radiation with chemotherapy may be given.  Another option rarely used for cancers that are larger and quite extensive is a complete radical vulvectomy and removal of the groin lymph nodes.  If the lymph nodes are not removed because the patient is not healthy enough to have the surgery, radiation therapy may be given to the groin areas. If the lymph nodes are enlarged, a needle biopsy may be done before treatment to see if the nodes contain cancer cells.  Patients who are not healthy enough to have any surgery may be treated with just radiation therapy alone.  Stage II  Stage II cancers have spread to structures near the vulva, such as the anus, the lower vagina, and/or the lower  urethra. One option for treatment is partial radical vulvectomy (removal of the tumor, nearby parts of the vulva, and other tissues containing cancer). Surgery may also include removal of the lymph nodes in the groin on both sides of the body (or sentinel node biopsies). Radiation therapy may be given after surgery if cancer cells are at or near the margins (edges of the tissue removed by surgery).  For women who are too sick or weak from other medical problems to have surgery, radiation (with or without chemotherapy) may be used as the main treatment.  Stage III  Stage III cancers have spread to nearby lymph nodes . Treatment may include surgery to remove the cancer (either a radical wide local incision or partial or complete radical vulvectomy) and lymph nodes in the groin. This may be followed by radiation therapy . Sometimes chemotherapy (chemo) is given along with the radiation to help it work better.  These cancers may also be treated with radiation (with or without chemo) first, followed by surgery to remove any remaining cancer. This is often done to try to preserve normal structures such as the vagina, urethra and anus.  Radiation and chemo (without surgery) may be used as the main treatment for patients who cannot have surgery due to other medical problems.  Stage IVA  These cancers have spread more extensively to organs and tissues in the pelvis, such as the rectum (above the anus), the bladder, the pelvic bone, the upper part of the vagina, and the upper part of the urethra. When treated with surgery , the goal is to remove as much of the cancer as possible. The extent of the surgery  depends on what organs contain cancer cells. Pelvic exenteration is an option, but it's rarely used.  The standard approach is to combine surgery, radiation, and chemo. Radiation therapy may be done before or after surgery. Chemo may also be given before surgery.  Radiation and possibly chemo can also be given to women who can't have surgery because of other medical problems.  Stage IVA also includes tumors with less spread to nearby organs, but spread to nearby lymph nodes that has caused the lymph nodes to become fixed (stuck to the underlying tissue) or ulcerated (become open sores). These cancers are often treated with radical vulvectomy and removal of the groin lymph nodes . Radiation (often with chemo) may be given either before or after surgery.  Stage IVB  These cancers have spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis or to organs and tissues outside the pelvis (like the lungs or liver). There is no standard treatment for them. Surgery is not expected to cure these cancers, but may be helpful in relieving symptoms, such as bowel or bladder blockages. Radiation may also be helpful in shrinking the cancer and improving symptoms. Chemo may also be an option. Experts recommend that these women enroll in a clinical trial .  Recurrent vulvar cancer  When cancer comes back after treatment, it's called recurrent cancer . Treatment options depend on how soon the cancer comes back and whether the recurrence is local (in the vulva), regional (in nearby lymph nodes), or distant (has spread to organs such as the lungs or bones).  If the recurrence is local, it may still be possible to remove the cancer by surgery or by using combinations of chemo , radiation therapy , and surgery.  When the cancer has grown too large or spread too far to be surgically removed (it's unresectable), chemo and/or radiation therapy may be used to help relieve symptoms such as pain, or to shrink the tumor so that surgery may become an option. If treatment is given only to relieve pain or bleeding, it's called palliative (symptom relief) therapy.  It's very important to understand that palliative treatment is not expected to cure a cancer. Women with advanced vulvar cancer are encouraged to enter a clinical trial where they may get new treatments that might be helpful but are as yet unproven.

Author information 1 University of Miami, Jackson Memorial Hospital, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, 1611 NW 12 Avenue, East Tower, Room 3003, Miami, FL 33136, USA. Abstract Recurrent vulvar cancer occurs in an average of 24% of cases after primary treatment after surgery with or without radiation. The relatively few primary vulvar cancers, combined with the low proportion of recurrences, has made it difficult to perform randomized studies to document the most appropriate therapeutic modalities. Most reports are small retrospective studies and anecdotal reviews that have emphasized the importance of surgery and have led to new approaches with respect to chemoradiation. Traditionally, the most accepted treatment of vulvar cancer has been and continues to be surgery. Recently, radiation and chemotherapy have been combined with very encouraging results. The therapeutic modality used depends on the location and extent of the recurrence. Most recurrences occur locally near the original resection margins or at the ipsilateral inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes. Lateralized local vulvar recurrences treated with a wide radical local excision with inguinal lymphadectomy results in an excellent cure rate of 70%. With a central pelvic recurrence with antecedent radiotherapy involving the urethra, upper vagina, and rectum, total pelvic exenteration is indicated in a select group of patients with curative intent. Radiotherapy or chemoradiation concomitantly with wide radical local excision of an advanced vulvar has proven successful in avoiding an exenteration, with improved survival and less morbidity. Prospective and retrospective studies have shown excellent results using radiation or chemoradiation with wide radical local excision in patients with locally advanced disease in whom adequate resection margins are difficult to achieve (with a central lesion requiring exenteration) or with debilitating medical conditions that preclude surgery. In these patients, chemoradiation has shown favorable results when used before a wide local resection. In patients with advanced local disease, external beam and interstitial radiation has been used for palliative and curative intent with encouraging results. Regional recurrences to the inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes have been shown to have a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate. We recommend that inguinal recurrences without prior radiation therapy undergo excision followed by radiotherapy with chemosensitization. In patients with previous radiation to the inguinal lymph nodes, we try to avoid any excisional procedures because of the high rate of complications. We offer these patients brachytherapy for palliation. With pelvic recurrences, we recommended chemoradiation as the treatment modality. In the subset of patients with distant metastasis, chemotherapy may be offered; however, few studies have been performed to advocate any single combination. The literature supports the use of 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin as single agents or in combination to have sensitivity against squamous cells. There are few studies revealing improvement in 5-year survival, thus these patients may benefit from recruitment into research protocols.

Decisions about treatment of recurrent VSCC mainly depend on the location of the recurrence and previous treatment, resulting in individualized and consensus-based approaches. Most recurrences (40–80%) occur within 2 years after initial treatment. Currently, wide local excision is the treatment of choice for local recurrences. Isolated local recurrence of VSCC has a good prognosis, with reported 5-year survival rates of up to 60%. Groin recurrences and distant recurrences are less common and have an extremely poor prognosis. For groin recurrences, surgery with or without (chemo) radiotherapy is a treatment option, depending on prior treatment. For distant recurrences, there are only palliative treatment options. In this review, we give an overview of the available literature and discuss epidemiology, risk factors, and prognostic factors for the different types of recurrent VSCC and we describe treatment options and clinical outcome.

Return To Main Article :   Cancer of the Vulva  What Is A Recurrence?  A recurrence means that cancer has returned after the initial treatment. It can come back to the vulva or to another part of the body. There is no clear timeline as to what qualifies as a recurrence but there is a difference between recurrence and progression. A progression is where the original cancer continues to grow after treatment, although symptoms may not be immediately apparent. Recurrence is where the original cancer is considered ‘cleared’, and a new one has formed. If a woman undergoes vulva cancer treatment and cancer recurs after a few months, doctors will question - is it recurrence or was it ever really gone (progression)? It may be difficult to say. However there is a consensus among medical experts that if cancer comes back within 12 months of treatment, then it is progression and not recurrence. It may be that the original treatment was not completely successful and some tiny cancer cells remained behind but were too small to pick up by imaging and blood tests. Those cells then grow back and eventually cause symptoms to return. If cancer comes back after 12 months it is considered a recurrence. Most recurrences of cancer of the vulva occur within the first 2 years. See, also what does cancer remission mean?    What Is The Prognosis?  Vulva cancer survival rates give the statistical probability of a person surviving the disease. This is also known as prognosis or outcome. Vulva cancer returns in about 24 percent of women after primary treatment (although some studies indicate as few as 10 percent). The prognosis for the patient will depend on the extent of the recurrence and their overall general health and age. Very likely the woman will need to go through the vulva cancer diagnosis process again and her doctors will want to stage the tumor(s) (see vulva cancer staging ) so that they can learn as much as possible about it. One study by the Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Jackson Memorial Hospital (2002) reported an excellent cure rate (70 percent) for patients with local recurrences confined to the vulva area. The prognosis was not as fortunate for those with regional recurrences where cancer had spread to pelvic lymph nodes (higher mortality rates were reported). The sooner the recurrence is diagnosed, the better the prognosis. This is why follow-up care after primary (original) treatment is so important.    What Are The Signs Of A Recurrence?  The symptoms will depend on what stage of cancer is present. Some patients may even be asymptomatic (no symptoms) and the first warning sign could be elevated levels of CA 125 found in a blood test. Most women who undergo cancer treatments will have their blood checked regularly afterwards for the tumor marker CA 125. Rising levels can indicate the return of a tumor. If a recurrence is local, then any of the following symptoms of vulva cancer can return:  • Changes in the texture or color of the vulva skin. • Persistent itching of the vulva. • Burning sensation when passing urine. • White raised patches of skin or warts on the vulva. • An ulceration or sore that will not heal.  Advanced Stages  Most patients with advanced stages of the disease will experience pain that can significantly reduce their quality of life. Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is sudden and does not last; once the cause of the pain is identified it can usually be successfully managed. Chronic pain on the other hand is persistent and normally lasts longer than 3 months. This sort of pain can be caused by the progression of the disease or the result of treatment. It may cause depression and insomnia. How pain affects a patient will depend on a number of factors including their personal threshold for pain, their age, general health and past experiences with pain.  How Is It Treated?  As primary vulvar cancers are so rare, and recurrences even rarer, large-scale studies into optimal treatment methods are difficult. Most studies for this reason are small – but they have reported anecdotal successes in the use of cancer surgery and more lately chemoradiation. Which treatment is used depends on a number of factors including the extent of the cancer, symptoms present and what treatment the patient received in the past. Surgery continues to be the main form of treatment but it may be combined with either radiation therapy and/or chemo (see chemotherapy guide ). The treatment options are:   • Wide local excision with/without radiation therapy. • Radical vulvectomy combined with pelvic exenteration. • Radiation therapy and chemo, applied in the same time period. With/without surgery. • Radiation therapy followed by chemo or surgery. • Palliative radiation therapy to help relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. • Participation in cancer clinical trials to try experimental treatments.  Most recurrences are local which means they can be treated with wide local excision (cutting out the tumor) and inguinal lymphadectomy (removal of lymph nodes). See vulva cancer treatment for more details on these procedures. The cure rate is normally about 70 percent. In rare cases, advanced cancer may be treated by radical vulvectomy and pelvic exenteration.  This can mean the removal of the vulva, vagina and cervix as well as the lower colon, bladder or rectum. As this is such a radical procedure doctors will always try to look for other possible treatments first. The use of radiotherapy and chemoradiation combined with radical local excision has had some success in avoiding the necessity of pelvic exenteration and has led to better survival rates (a 5 year survival rate greater than 50 percent).  If doctors feel the patient is not a candidate for surgery (possibly due to previous treatments or advanced age), they may recommend the use of radiotherapy, possibly followed by chemotherapy. Patients with metastatic disease (which has spread to distant parts of the body) may be offered radiation therapy for palliative reasons. As there is no standard chemotherapy or systemic treatment for metastatic vulva cancer, such women should consider clinical trials. A few studies indicate an improvement  in their 5 year survival rate by doing so. Metastatic cancer, while a very serious diagnosis, is viewed by  progressive doctors as a 'chronic disease' which may be possible to manage. Patients can undergo treatment and experience periods of remission and their quality of life can be good throughout.  Interesting: Read about Vulva cancer prevention .

It may come back in the vulva or elsewhere in the body. Although tumors may appear in distant sites, it is not a new cancer. It is a recurrence of the original cancer.  If you have recurrent vulvar cancer, SCCA can offer you new medical procedures and treatments, as well as access to clinical trials, that your community doctor may not know about. No one at SCCA will tell you that a diagnosis of recurrent disease is not serious, but there is hope.  The treatment you receive for a recurrence of your vulvar cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation--or a combination of these treatments. Your treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the type of treatment you have received in the past, and the symptoms you are experiencing with the new cancer. Depending on the extent of the disease, your doctors may recommend that you have a wide local excision, which may be followed by radiation therapy. Rarely, you may need a more extensive surgery, called pelvic exenteration. In this procedure, the uterus, cervix, and vagina are removed, as well as other organs to which the cancer has spread, such as the lower colon, rectum, or bladder. If your doctors feel that surgery is not appropriate for you, they may recommend that you have radiation therapy, possibly in combination with chemotherapy, or alone. Radiation therapy is used for local recurrences and also to reduce symptoms of recurrent disease. Ask your doctor about taking part in clinical trials of promising treatments for recurrent disease. Living With Metastatic Disease Any person who has faced cancer lives with the fear that cancer will return. And the first response many people have to the news of metastases is to fear that they will soon die. If you have metastatic disease, you will learn a new definition of metastatic cancer—"a chronic disease that can be managed." It's a very different way of looking at cancer. You can expect to have periods of treatment, followed by periods of remission, with a fairly good quality of life throughout. Emotionally, this can be tough. You may want to talk with a chaplain or social worker or join a support group . SCCA has several support groups for patients and for caregivers and family members.

Use the menu to see other pages.  This section tells you the treatments that are the standard of care for this type of cancer. “Standard of care” means the best treatments known. When making treatment plan decisions, patients may be encouraged to consider clinical trials as an option. A clinical trial is a research study that tests a new approach to treatment. Doctors want to learn whether the new treatment is safe, effective, and possibly better than the standard treatment. Clinical trials can test a new drug, a new combination of standard treatments, or new doses of standard drugs or other treatments. Your doctor can help you consider all your treatment options. To learn more about clinical trials, see the About Clinical Trials and Latest Research sections.  Treatment overview  In cancer care, different types of doctors often work together to create a patient’s overall treatment plan that combines different types of treatments. This is called a multidisciplinary team . Cancer care teams include a variety of other health care professionals, such as physician assistants, oncology nurses, social workers, pharmacists, counselors, dietitians, and others.  Treatment options and recommendations for vulvar cancer depend on several factors, including:   The type and stage of cancer    Possible side effects    The patient’s preferences and overall health   Your care plan may include treatment for symptoms and side effects, an important part of cancer care. Take time to learn about all of your treatment options and be sure to ask questions about things that are unclear. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment and what you can expect while receiving the treatment. Learn more about making treatment decisions .  Treatment overview for VIN  As explained in the Introduction , VIN is a precancerous condition. VIN is usually treated by simple surgical removal of the disease. The treatment plan may also include laser surgery and/or medication(s) applied to the vulva area. If the VIN is extensive, a partial (not radical) and superficial (only the removal of the skin without removing the fatty tissues beneath the skin) surgical removal of the vulva may be recommended. See below for more information on each of these treatment options.  Treatment overview for vulvar cancer  The main treatment for vulvar cancer is surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used if the cancer cannot be entirely removed with surgery, if the cancer has a high risk for recurrence, and/or if the lymph nodes are involved with cancer.  If the tumor has spread to the point that initial surgical removal is not possible, sometimes the patient’s treatment plan starts with radiation therapy, often with simultaneous low-dose chemotherapy given weekly during the radiation treatments. Surgical removal of the vulvar lesion sometimes considered if the entire tumor does not go away after these treatments.  Women with vulvar cancer may have concerns about if and how these treatments may affect their sexual function and fertility (ability to have children). These topics are important and should be discussed with the health care team before treatment begins.  Surgery  Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. A gynecologic oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating gynecologic cancer using surgery. Due to the location and sensitivity of vulvar tissue, the type of surgery is carefully considered.  Surgical options for invasive vulvar cancer include the removal of part or all of the vulva, depending on the size and spread of the primary tumor. This is called a vulvectomy.  Vulvectomy. Different vulvectomy approaches to treat invasive vulvar cancer include:   Radical local excision of the vulva. This surgery is done to remove the tumor and a large amount of tissue around it, called a margin. It is used for most primary tumors that are less than 4 centimeters (cm) in diameter and are either stage I or stage II disease.    Modified radical vulvectomy. This term describes a surgical procedure in which less than the full vulva is removed. For example, in a radical hemivulvectomy , only one side of the vulva is removed.    Radical vulvectomy. A radical vulvectomy is the removal of part or all of the vulva, along with the underlying deep tissue. This is a very uncommon operation because most vulvectomies are modified in some way, and very large tumors are usually treated with chemoradiation, as described below.   Laser surgery is the use of a focused beam of light that vaporizes a premalignant skin lesion. It cannot be used to treat an invasive tumor .  Lymphadenectomy. As explained in Diagnosis , this is a surgical procedure to remove lymph nodes in the groin in order to check for cancer.  Learn more about the basics of cancer surgery .  Coping with vulvar surgery  Many women experience a range of emotions after vulvar surgery, such as loss, sadness, or anxiety. Some women may feel that they have lost their identity as women. Others have questions about whether sexual intercourse can continue after surgery. Women may also worry about how the surgery will affect their relationships with their partners.  Before surgery, it is important to talk with the surgeon about the procedure, the possible side effects, and when sexual intercourse can begin again. Women should talk with their doctors about finding additional information or support in coping with this type of surgery. Learn more about sexual health and cancer treatment in women .  Chemoradiation therapy for advanced-stage vulvar cancers  For very large vulvar tumors, radiation therapy is often combined with concurrent  low-dose chemotherapy  before surgery  to shrink the tumor to avoid removing the entire vulva and to decrease how much tissue is removed. This is called chemoradiation therapy. The chemotherapy is given at the same time as the radiation therapy. This treatment option is particularly important when the tumor involves the urethra or anus so that urinary and bowel function can be preserved. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are explained in detail below.  Radiation therapy  Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-rays or other particles to destroy cancer cells. A doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer is called a radiation oncologist. Radiation therapy may be used before surgery to shrink the size of the tumor or after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells.  The most common type of radiation treatment is called external-bean radiation therapy, which is radiation given from a machine outside the body. When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. A radiation therapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time. Learn more about the basics of radiation therapy .  General side effects from radiation therapy may include fatigue, mild to severe skin reactions, upset stomach and loose bowel movements, damage to healthy vaginal tissue, or narrowing of the vagina. Most of these side effects go away soon after treatment is finished. However, the vagina may shorten and narrow so much that sexual intercourse is not possible. To prevent this, the vagina may need to be stretched with a plastic tube called a vaginal dilator several times a week.  For more information about radiation therapy for gynecologic cancer, see the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology's pamphlet, Radiation Therapy for Gynecologic Cancers .  Chemotherapy  Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells, usually by ending the cancer cells’ ability to grow and divide. Chemotherapy is given by a gynecologic oncologist or medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with medication.  Systemic chemotherapy gets into the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body. Common ways to give chemotherapy include an intravenous (IV) tube placed into a vein using a needle or in a pill or capsule that is swallowed.  A chemotherapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time. A patient may receive 1 drug at a time or combinations of different drugs given at the same time.  If the patient is to receive external radiation therapy for locally spread vulvar cancer, chemotherapy with cisplatin (Platinol) is sometimes given intravenously every week at the same time as the radiation therapy.  If the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis or has recurred, doctors sometimes consider using drugs that are used to treat cervical cancer and vaginal cancer , which are other HPV-induced squamous cell gynecologic cancers.  For metastatic vulvar cancer, patients are most often treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy, typically carboplatin (Paraplatin) and paclitaxel (Taxol). Sometimes bevacizumab (Avastin) is added to this combination.  The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the individual and the drugs and doses used. They can include fatigue, risk of infection, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite, or diarrhea. These side effects usually go away after treatment is finished.  Whether these drugs are used depends on the patient’s overall health, their kidney function measured as by laboratory tests, and other medical factors.  Learn more about the basics of chemotherapy and preparing for treatment . The medications used to treat cancer are continually being evaluated. Talking with your doctor is often the best way to learn about the medications prescribed for you, their purpose, and their potential side effects or interactions with other medications. Learn more about your prescriptions by using searchable drug databases .  Getting care for symptoms and side effects  Cancer and its treatment often cause side effects. In addition to treatments intended to slow, stop, or eliminate the cancer, an important part of cancer care is relieving a person’s symptoms and side effects. This approach is called palliative or supportive care, and it includes supporting the patient with his or her physical, emotional, and social needs.  Palliative care is any treatment that focuses on reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and supporting patients and their families . Any person, regardless of age or type and stage of cancer, may receive palliative care. It works best when palliative care is started as early as needed in the cancer treatment process.  People often receive treatment for the cancer at the same time they receive treatment to ease side effects, including topical treatments applied to the skin, such as creams, to relieve symptoms like itching and burning. Patients who receive both at the same time often have less severe symptoms, better quality of life, and report they are more satisfied with treatment.  Palliative treatments vary widely and often include medication, nutritional changes, relaxation techniques, emotional support and other therapies. You may also receive palliative treatments similar to those meant to eliminate the cancer, such as chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation therapy. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment in the treatment plan.  Before treatment begins, talk with your health care team about the possible side effects of your specific treatment plan and palliative care options. During and after treatment, be sure to tell your doctor or another health care team member if you are experiencing a problem so it can be addressed as quickly as possible.  Learn more about palliative care .  Metastatic vulvar cancer  If cancer spreads to another part in the body from where it started, doctors call it metastatic cancer. In these situations, chemotherapy may be recommended. The drugs that are used to treat most metastatic vulvar cancer are typically the same as those used for metastatic cervical cancer .  It is a good idea to talk with doctors who have experience in treating metastatic vulvar cancer, such as a gynecologic oncologist. Doctors can have different opinions about the best standard treatment plan. Also, clinical trials might be an option. Learn more about getting a second opinion before starting treatment, so you are comfortable with your chosen treatment plan.  Your treatment plan may include a combination of the treatments discussed above. Palliative care will also be important to help relieve symptoms and side effects.  For most patients, a diagnosis of metastatic cancer is very stressful and, at times, difficult to bear. Patients and their families are encouraged to talk about the way they are feeling with doctors, nurses, social workers, or other members of the health care team. It may also be helpful to talk with other patients, including through a support group.  Remission and the chance of recurrence  A remission is when cancer cannot be detected in the body and there are no symptoms. This may also be called having “no evidence of disease” or NED.  A remission may be temporary or permanent. This uncertainty causes many people to worry that the cancer will come back. While many remissions are permanent, it is important to talk with your doctor about the possibility of the cancer returning and what will be done to watch for a recurrence (see “Watching for recurrence” in Follow-up Care ). Understanding your risk of recurrence and the treatment options may help you feel more prepared if the cancer does return. Learn more about coping with the fear of recurrence .  If the cancer does return after the original treatment, it is called recurrent cancer . It may come back in the same place (called a local recurrence), nearby (regional recurrence), or in another place (distant recurrence).  When this occurs, a new cycle of testing will begin to learn as much as possible about the recurrence. After this testing is done, you and your doctor will talk about your treatment options. Often the treatment plan will include the treatments described above, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, but they may be used in a different combination or given at a different pace. Your doctor may suggest clinical trials that are studying new ways to treat this type of recurrent cancer.  Whichever treatment plan you choose, palliative care will be important for relieving symptoms and side effects.  People with recurrent cancer often experience emotions such as disbelief or fear. Patients are encouraged to talk with their health care team about these feelings and ask about support services to help them cope. Learn more about dealing with cancer recurrence .  If treatment fails  Recovery from cancer is not always possible. If the cancer cannot be cured or controlled, the disease may be called advanced or terminal.  This diagnosis is stressful, and advanced cancer is difficult to discuss for many people. However, it is important to have open and honest conversations with your doctor and health care team to express your feelings, preferences, and concerns. The health care team is there to help, and many team members have special skills, experience, and knowledge to support patients and their families. Making sure a person is physically comfortable and free from pain is extremely important.  Patients who have advanced cancer and who are expected to live less than 6 months may want to consider a type of palliative care called hospice care. Hospice care is designed to provide the best possible quality of life for people who are near the end of life. Patients may consider staying at home instead of in a different or facility-based environment. You and your family are encouraged to think about where you would be most comfortable: at home, in the hospital, or in a hospice environment. Nursing care and special equipment can make staying at home a workable alternative for many families. Learn more about advanced cancer care planning .  After the death of a loved one, many people need support to help them cope with the loss. Learn more about grief and loss .  The next section in this guide is About Clinical Trials .

You will also read information about surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 6,190 women in the United States will be diagnosed with vulvar cancer. Its incidence is increasing in young women because of its association with the human papillomavirus (HPV). See the Risk Factors and Prevention section for more information on HPV.  It is estimated that 1,200 deaths from this disease will occur this year.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of women live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. Survival rates depend on several factors, including the type of vulvar cancer and the stage of disease at the time it is diagnosed.  If cancer is found at the earliest stage before it has spread, the 5-year survival rate is 86%. If the cancer has only spread to nearby lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is 54%. If it is found after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 16%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for women with this type of cancer are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of women with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. Women should talk with their doctor if they have any questions about this information.

All rights reserved worldwide                     Vulvar Cancer Recurrence  Cancer » Vulvar Cancer » Vulvar Cancer Recurrence The vulvar cancer recurrence should be detected by the patients as early as possible. The cancer recurrence often takes place if the tumor has spread to the other parts of the body. The vulvar cancer usually consists of two types, the primary vulvar cancer and the secondary vulvar cancer. The primary vulvar cancer develops in the vulva itself and may spread to other parts of the body. The secondary vulvar cancer develops in parts other than the vulva. Even if the tumor appears in other parts of the body, it is not a new cancer. It is recurrence of the original cancer.     According to statastics of vulvar cancer , near about 4340 patients will be diagnosed. If the vulvar cancer is not diagnosed during its initial stages, there are chances of the cancer to spread. During diagnosis, the vulva and area around it is searched for the tumor. There are many ways used to detect vulvar cancer. They are as follows:  Biopsy Pelvic Exam Cystoscopy Proctoscopy X-rays Intravenous pyelogram CT scan Magnetic resonance Imaging  After these tests are thoroughly performed, the detection of tumor is located. This helps to plan the treatment. If the cancer is in its early stage it's simple to operate. The chances of recurrence of the cancer are also less. But if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it's difficult to operate and the chances of recurrence are also high. The treatment of the vulvar cancer mainly depends on the site and extent of recurrence. It also depends on the type of treatment patient has received in the past and symptoms experienced due to new cancer. The treatments given to the patients with recurrence of vulvar cancer are as follows:  Radical Excision : This procedure is used to remove a tumor and large amount of normal tissue surrounding it. In this surgery, lymph nodes may also be removed. Radical excision may result in long term pain relief and also helps to prevent cancer recurrence. Palliative Radiation Therapy : Palliative therapy can also be called as comport care. It is basically used for the cancer treatment where long term cancer control is not possible. When local recurrence occurs after two years of primary treatment, a combination of surgery and radiation therapy is done. It may result in 5 year survival rate of vulva cancer . Radiation therapy is often suggested when doctors feel that surgery is not appropriate for the patient. It is used for local recurrence and to reduce symptoms of vulvar cancer . After diagnosis, according to the extent of the disease, doctors may recommend the patient to have a wide local excision followed by radiation therapy. This vulver cancer therapy is often used for patients having local recurrence. If the recurrence is detected in the later stages of the cancer, you may need a more extensive surgery, called pelvic exenteration. During this surgery, the cervix, vagina and the uterus are treated. If the cancer has spread to other parts like rectum, lower colon or bladder, they are treated as well. Synchronous radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy is also an option for the treatment of vulvar cancer recurrence. Adjuvant therapy is also used. In this therapy, chemotherapy or radiation therapy are performed after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.  Treating vulvar cancer recurrence is same as treating vulvar cancer. After diagnosis, the exact stage is detected and following treatments are given:  Laser Therapy : In this therapy, laser beams are used to kill the cancer cells. Surgery : Surgery is done to remove cancer without any loss to patient's sexual functions. There are different types of surgery performed as follows:  Wide local excision Radical local excision Vulvectomy Pelvic exenteration  Radiation Therapy : High energy x-rays are used during this treatment. There are two types of radiation therapy, external and internal radiation therapy. They are used depending upon the stage of the cancer. Chemotherapy : Drugs are used during this treatment to stop the growth of cancer cells.  Patients should not get depressed after vulvar cancer recurrence.

Vulvar cancer is cancer that starts in the vulva. This is the outer part of the female
      reproductive system. This is also called the external genitalia.  The vulva includes the mons pubis. This is the rounded area in front of the pubic
      bones that becomes covered with hair at puberty. It also includes the skin folds under
      the pubic hair that protect the opening of the urethra (the tube that carries urine
      out of the body) and the vagina.  The vulva has two folds of skin. The outer folds are called the labia majora. The
      inner folds are called the labia minora.  The inner folds of the vulva form a hood of skin called the prepuce or the hood of
      the clitoris. Below the prepuce is the clitoris. The clitoris is a sensitive piece
      of tissue that swells with blood when stimulated.  At the bottom of the inner folds of the vulva is the fourchette. This is where the
      labia minora meet. Below the fourchette is the perineum. This is also part of the
      vulva. The perineum ends at the anus. The anus is where stool leaves the body.  Vulvar cancer is rare. It only accounts for about 4 percent of all female reproductive
      organ cancers. If it’s found in its early stages, vulvar cancer is highly curable.
      Fortunately, most cases are diagnosed in the earlier stages.  Who gets vulvar cancer?  According to the American Cancer Society, about 5,950 women will be diagnosed with
      vulvar cancer in the U.S. in 2016. Most women with vulvar cancer are older than 50
      years. More than half are older than 70 years at the time they learn they have cancer.  Who is at risk for vulvar cancer?  Certain factors can make women more likely to get vulvar cancer. These are called
      risk factors. Just because a woman has one or more risk factors does not mean she
      will get vulvar cancer. In fact, a woman can have all of the risk factors and still
      not get the disease. Or, a woman can have no known risk factors and get vulvar cancer.
      Experts aren’t exactly sure what causes vulvar cancer. However, possible risk factors
      can include:    Age. Women older than 50 years are more at risk for squamous cell carcinoma. This
            is the most common type of vulvar cancer.    Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a group of viruses that can cause genital
            warts. HPV has been linked to certain cancers. Women infected with certain types of
            HPV may be more at risk for vulvar cancer.    Smoking. Smoking increases your risk for vulvar cancer. If you smoke and have been
            infected with a high-risk strain of HPV, you’re at an even greater risk for vulvar
            cancer.    Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). This condition causes a change in the cells
            on the surface of the vulva. Women with VIN may be more likely to get vulvar cancer.    Lichen sclerosus. Women with this condition have vulvar skin that’s itchy and thin.
            These women are at a slightly higher risk of getting vulvar cancer.    Family history of melanoma. Women with a family history of melanoma or atypical moles
            have a higher risk of getting a melanoma of the vulva.    Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Women with HIV are more at risk for
            vulvar cancer.    History of cervical cancer. Having cervical cancer is linked with a higher risk for
            vulvar cancer. The two types of cancer share some risk factors. These include having
            certain types of HPV infections and smoking.    Immunosuppression. Women whose immune system is weakened are at higher risk of vulvar
            cancer. This may include women with HIV. It may also include women who have had a
            transplant and are taking medicine to prevent rejection.    What are the symptoms of vulvar cancer?  A woman can have vulvar cancer without having any symptoms. Note that some symptoms
      of vulvar cancer are similar to the symptoms of VIN. Symptoms of vulvar cancer can
      include:    Vulvar itching that does not improve    Change in skin color or feel of vulva    Red, white, or wart-like bump or sore on the vulva    Pain when urinating    Burning or bleeding and discharge that’s not related to the menstrual cycle    Enlarged glands (lymph nodes) in the groin    A new mole on the vulva or a change in a mole's size or appearance, including irregular
            color or borders    An ulcer or cracking of the vulvar skin that does not heal    How is vulvar cancer diagnosed?  If you have symptoms of vulvar cancer, see your healthcare provider. He or she may
      do the following:    Clinical history and physical exam. Your healthcare provider will ask questions to
            learn about your symptoms, personal and family history, and risk factors. A thorough
            physical exam includes a pelvic exam and a Pap test. These can also help rule out
            other problems.    HPV test. Your healthcare provider can test for HPV at the same time as a Pap test.    Colposcopy of the vulva. For this test, your healthcare provider uses a tool called
            a colposcope. This tool magnifies cells on the surface of the cervix, vagina, and
            vulva. It allows your healthcare provider to select suspicious looking spots of tissue
            to remove and examine. This is called a biopsy.    Biopsy. Your healthcare provider may take a small piece of tissue from the vulva.
            A pathologist looks at it under a microscope to check for cancer cells.    How is vulvar cancer treated?  Your treatment depends on the type of vulvar cancer you have. It also depends on the
      results of lab tests and the stage or extent of the cancer. Your healthcare provider
      will also consider your age and general health when making treatment recommendations.
      The most common ways to treat vulvar cancer are with surgery and/or radiation. You
      may also need chemotherapy.  Should everyone get a second opinion for vulvar cancer?  Many people with cancer get a second opinion from another healthcare provider. There
      are many reasons to get a second opinion. Here are some of those reasons:    Not feeling comfortable with the treatment decision    Being diagnosed with an invasive or rare type of vulvar cancer    Having several options for how to treat the cancer    Not being able to see a cancer expert    It may help to have a second healthcare provider review the diagnosis and treatment
      options before starting treatment. Gynecologic oncologists are doctors with advanced
      training in the diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of female cancers. These include
      vulvar cancer. Know that, in most cases, a short delay in treatment will not lower
      the chance that it will work. Some health insurance companies even require that a
      person with cancer seek a second opinion. Many companies will pay for a second opinion.  How can I get a second opinion for vulvar cancer?  There are many ways to get a second opinion:    Ask a primary care healthcare provider. He or she may be able to recommend a specialist.
            These can include a gynecologic oncologist, medical oncologist, or radiation oncologist.
            Sometimes these doctors work together at cancer centers or programs.    Call the Foundation for Women's Cancer. The number is 312-578-1439 They can help callers
            find a gynecologic oncologist for a second opinion. Or use the Find a Gynecologic Oncologist tool at their website to search for a gynecologic oncologist by zip code. You can also find one at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology .    Call the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service. The number is 800-4-CANCER
            (800-422-6237). They have information about treatment facilities, including cancer
            centers and other programs supported by the National Cancer Institute.    Seek other options. Check with a local medical society, a nearby hospital, a medical
            school, or local cancer advocacy groups. Or talk with other women who've had vulvar
            cancer to get names of specialists who can give you a second opinion.    What are clinical trials?  Clinical trials are studies of new kinds of cancer treatments. Experts use clinical
      trials to learn how well new treatments work and what their side effects are. Promising
      treatments are ones that work better or have fewer side effects than the current treatments.
      People who participate in these studies get to use treatments before the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) approves them. People who join trials also help researchers
      learn more about cancer and help future cancer patients. There is a large searchable
      database at www.clinicaltrials.gov where you can see what trials might be available
      for you.

Category Cancer A-Z    Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention     Risk Factors for Vulvar Cancer    What Causes Vulvar Cancer?    Can Vulvar Cancer Be Prevented?             Vulvar Cancer  Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention             Risk Factors for Vulvar Cancer       A risk factor is anything that changes a person's chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. For example, exposing skin to strong sunlight is a risk factor for skin cancer. Smoking is a risk factor for many cancers.  There are different kinds of risk factors. Some, such as your age or race, can’t be changed. Others may be related to personal choices such as smoking, drinking, or diet. Some factors influence risk more than others. But risk factors don't tell us everything. Having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that a person will get the disease. Also, not having any risk factors doesn't mean that you won't get it, either.  Although several risk factors increase the odds of developing vulvar cancer, most women with these risks do not develop it. And some women who don’t have any apparent risk factors develop vulvar cancer. When a woman develops vulvar cancer, it is usually not possible to say with certainty that a particular risk factor was the cause.  Age  The risk of vulvar cancer goes up as women age. Less than 20% of cases are in women younger than age 50, and more than half occur in women over age 70. The average age of women diagnosed with invasive vulvar cancer is 70, whereas women diagnosed with non-invasive vulvar cancer average about 20 years younger.  Human papillomavirus  HPV stands for human papilloma v irus . HPVs are a large group of related viruses. They are called papillomaviruses because some of them cause a type of growth called a papilloma . Papillomas — more commonly known as warts — are not cancers. Different HPV types can cause different types of warts in different parts of the body. Some types cause common warts on the hands and feet. Other types tend to cause warts on the lips or tongue.  Certain HPV types can infect the outer female and male genital organs and the anal area, causing raised, bumpy warts. These warts may barely be visible or they may be several inches across. The medical term for genital warts is condyloma acuminatum .  Two types of HPV (HPV 6 and HPV 11) cause most cases of genital warts, but are seldom linked to cancer and are known as low-risk HPV.  Other HPV types have been linked with cancers of the cervix , vagina , and vulva in women, cancer of the penis in men, and cancers of the anus and throat (in men and women). These are known as high-risk types of HPV and include HPV 16 and  HPV 18 as well as others. Infection with a high-risk HPV may produce no visible signs until pre-cancerous changes or cancer develops.  HPV can  pass from one person to another during skin-to-skin contact. One way HPV is spread is through sexual activity, including vaginal and anal intercourse and even oral sex.  Some doctors think there are 2 kinds of vulvar cancer. One kind is associated with HPV infection (more than half of all vulvar cancers are linked to infection with the high-risk HPV types) and tends to occur in younger women. The other is not associated with HPV infection, is more often found in older women, and may develop from a precursor lesion called differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (discussed below).  Vaccines have been developed to help prevent infection with some types of HPV.  For more about HPV, see HPV (Human Papillomavirus) .  Smoking  Smoking exposes people to many cancer-causing chemicals that affect more than their lungs. These harmful substances can be absorbed into the lining of the lungs and spread throughout the body. Smoking increases the risk of developing vulvar cancer. Among women who have a history of HPV infection, smoking further increases the risk of developing vulvar cancer. If women are infected with a high-risk HPV, they have a much higher risk of developing vulvar cancer if they smoke.  HIV infection  HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Because this virus damages the immune system, it makes women more likely to get and to stay infected with HPV. This could increase the risk of vulvar pre-cancer and cancer. Scientists also believe that the immune system plays a role in destroying cancer cells and slowing their growth and spread.  Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)  Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva usually forms slowly over many years. Pre-cancerous changes often occur first and can last for several years. The medical term most often used for this pre-cancerous condition is vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia  (VIN). Intraepithelial means that the abnormal cells are only found in the surface layer of the vulvar skin (epithelium).  VIN is typed by how the lesions and cells look: usual-type VIN and differentiated-type VIN . It is sometimes graded VIN2 and VIN3, with the number 3 indicating furthest progression toward a true cancer. However, many doctors use only one grade of VIN.   Usual-type VIN occurs in younger women and is caused by HPV infection. When usual-type VIN changes into invasive squamous cell cancer, it becomes the basaloid or warty subtypes.  Differentiated-type VIN tends to occur in older women and is not linked to HPV infection. It can progress to the keratinizing subtype of invasive squamous cell cancer.   In the past, the term  dysplasia was used instead of VIN, but this term is used much less often now. When talking about dysplasia, there is also a range of increasing progress toward cancer -- first, mild dysplasia; next, moderate dysplasia; then severe dysplasia; and, finally, carcinoma in situ.  Although women with VIN have an increased risk of developing invasive vulvar cancer, most cases of VIN never progress to cancer. Still, since it is not possible to tell which cases will become cancers, treatment or close medical follow-up is needed.  The risk of progression to cancer seems to be highest with VIN3 and lower with VIN2. This risk can be altered with treatment. In one study, 88% of untreated VIN3 progressed to cancer, but of the women who were treated, only 4% developed vulvar cancer.  In the past, cases of VIN were included in the broad category of disorders known as vulvar dystrophy . Since this category included a wide variety of other diseases, most of which are not pre-cancerous, most doctors no longer use this term.  Lichen sclerosus  This disorder, also called lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA), causes the vulvar skin to become very thin and itchy. The risk of vulvar cancer appears to be slightly increased by LSA, with about 4% of women having LSA later developing vulvar cancer.  Other genital cancers  Women with cervical cancer also have a higher risk of vulvar cancer. This is probably because these cancers share certain risk factors. The same HPV types that are linked to cervical cancer are also linked to vulvar cancer. Smoking is also linked to a higher risk of both cervical and vulvar cancers.  Melanoma or atypical moles  Women who have had melanoma or dysplastic nevi (atypical moles) in other places have an increased risk of developing a melanoma on the vulva. A family history of melanoma also leads to an increased risk.

You will also read information about surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 6,190 women in the United States will be diagnosed with vulvar cancer. Its incidence is increasing in young women because of its association with the human papillomavirus (HPV). See the Risk Factors and Prevention section for more information on HPV.  It is estimated that 1,200 deaths from this disease will occur this year.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of women live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. Survival rates depend on several factors, including the type of vulvar cancer and the stage of disease at the time it is diagnosed.  If cancer is found at the earliest stage before it has spread, the 5-year survival rate is 86%. If the cancer has only spread to nearby lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is 54%. If it is found after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 16%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for women with this type of cancer are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of women with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. Women should talk with their doctor if they have any questions about this information.
