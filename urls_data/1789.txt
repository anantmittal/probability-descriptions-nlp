It sounds like you're talking about Mendelian Genetics. ;-)    If by hybrid pea you mean heterozygous, then you're look at two Aa genotypes, ya? So if you just set up your Punnett square...    (Hopefully the formatting will hold)    A a   ---------------------   A| AA Aa   a| Aa AA     So you get 2 phenotypes! 75% of the offspring will be tall plants (because AA, Aa, and Aa will all produce tall plants), and 25% of the offspring will be short plants (only AA can produce short plants).    But if you think your plants are homozygous (AA), then you'll only get 1 phenotype, they'll all be just like the parent plants (tall)!            A gardener has two tall pea plants. How can the gardener determine whether they are homozygous dominant or heterozygous for the gene determining the plant?  It would be homozygous dominant because the offspring were both tall so the genotypes would both be TT (Tall).               Robertybob  10 Contributions      In pea plants if tall plants are dominant to short plants and two heterozygous tall plants are crossed what percent of the offspring will probably be short?  Because heterozygous means that the parents contain both dominant and recessive genes the offspring will be 75% tall and 25% short. If you were to draw the punnett squares you would see that there are 3 possible children one with only dominant tall traits two with both dominant and recessive traits and one with only recessive traits.               Jashadow  230 Contributions      What happened when Gregor Mendel crossed homozygous tall pea plants with homozygous short pea plants?  When Gregor Mindel crossed homozygous tall plants with homozygous short plants,he got hetrozygous tall plants.. 
Tall plants will dominate any small pea plants in the same area. The traits for tall were dominant over short traits. Perhaps both alleles can code for protein, but the dominant product is expressed in the phenotype.            How did Mendel cross fertilize his pea plants?  Mendel took the pollen from one pea flower and put it onto anothers pistil. In order for there to be no other pollination, he covered them with protective bags, he also moved some into a greenhouse.               ChrissyBear  38 Contributions      Can a short pea plant ever be a hybrid?  No, the short pea trait is recessive and the tall pea plant trait is dominant. This means that if the plant is a hybrid, it has to be a tall pea plant. The dominant traits "mask" the recessive traits. The plant take one trait from their mom and one from their dad. If either the mom or the dad was not a tall, not hybrid pea plant then their kids would have to be tall be cause they would have one dominant, tall trait               Antonette Davis  267 Contributions      When Mendel mated tall pea plants with short pea plants what kind of pea plants did he get in the first generation?  The results of the first generation were 3 tall plants and 1 short plant, indicating that some activity was making the tall plants more likely, but not exclusively so.            What is the probability of producing a tall pea plant from a genetic cross between two hybrid tall pea plants?  Tt xTt gives 3 Tall (Tt, Tt, TT) :1 short (tt) =  3 in 4. .               ChrissyBear  38 Contributions      Can a short pea plant ever be a hybrid why or why not?  No, the short pea trait is recessive and the tall pea plant trait is dominant. This means that if the plant is a hybrid, it has to be a tall pea plant. The dominant traits "mask" the recessive traits. The plant take one trait from their mom and one from their dad. If either the mom or the dad was not a tall, not hybrid pea plant then their kids would have to be tall be cause they would have one dominant, tall trait.               Shabooboo  266 Contributions      What are the genotypes of a homozygous and a heterozygous tall pea plant?  \nThe word genotypes is in reference to the alleles an individual receives at fertilization. \n. 
\nLets say that the allele/gene/trait, genotype for the Tall plant is T and dominate and the allele/gene/trait genotype for the short plant is t and recessive.  \n. 
\nIf the genotype is an homozygous allele/gene/trait has two dominate alleles/genes/traits seen as two capital letters ex: dominate tall=TT or if the genotype is homozygous with two recessive alleles/genes/traits it will have two lower case letters ex: short=tt. \n. 
\nIf the genotype is heterozygous is a Tall plant that means the allele/gene/trait will have one dominate T=Tall and one recessive t=short and it will look like this Tt and with this genotype a Tall plant will be produce "T", even though that plant will still carry an allele/gene/trait for shortness "t".\n.

do you go to MHS?            What happened when Mendel crossed purebred tall pea plants with purebred short pea plans?  He got a tall plant. The tall gene is a dominant trait so when he crossed them he got a tall instead of a small.               Stevekim012  16,501 Contributions      If a homozygous tall pea and a homozygous short pea plant are crossed?  The resulting offspring will be 25% tall homozygous, 25% short homozygous, or 50% heterozygous. Depending on the gene, the heterozygous will either have codominance, incomplete dominance, normal dominance depending on which gene is dominantly expressed.            When a homozygous tall pea plant and a homozygous short pea plant cross what happens?  put TT on top of the box then put tt on the side and divide the box into 4 pieces then the top left box with be TT and the top right will be Tt and the bottom left will be Tt and the bottom right will be tt then it will be 75% tall and 25% short               GeekLove  2 Contributions      Show the cross between a heterozygous tall pea plant and a homozygous short pea plant?  If a plant that is heterozygous tall (Tt) is crossed with a plant that is homozygous short (tt) the cross would look something like this (Tt x tt). 
T t. 
t Tt tt. 
t Tt tt. 
50 percent of offspring produced would be heterozygous tall and the other 50 percent would be homozygous short.               Meave Gilchrist  24,958 Contributions  "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood." Marie Curie      What are the genotypes of a heterozygous tall pea plant?  The genotype is heterzygous, meaning that there are two different alleles. If you want to use letters to represent the tall and short alleles, you could use T for tall (capital letter indicates a dominant allele), and t for short (lowercase letter indicates a recessive allele). So the heterozygous genotype for a tall pea plant could be indicated by Tt.               John Doe  275 Contributions      If a pea plant has a recessive allele for green peas what will it produce?  A recessive allele means that the gene codes for an nonfunctional enzyme. If the pea plant has 2 recessive allele for the green pea gene, that means that the green pigment will not be deposited on the peas, as the enzyme is nonfunctional. The result would be yellow coloured peas.  If the pea plant has one recessive and one dominant allele for the green pea pigment, then it will result in a half functional enzyme, which is sufficient for the green pigment to be deposited.            What can a yellow pea plant and a green pea plant produce?  A yellow pea plant (Yy) and a green pea plant (yy) could produce ______ green phenotype(s) in offpspring               Qubbyb  20 Contributions      Can a pea plant ever be a hybrid?  Yes it can. It can be heterozygous for a trait such as height. However, because there are so many traits it has, it can easily be crossed with other plants and form hybrids.            Describe what happened when mendel crossed purebred tall plants with purebred short pea plants?  he made a table to show what kind a plane he will get he used T for tall and t for short               Wildly Alex  32,794 Contributions      What are the possible genotypes for tall pea plants?  Because the Tall gene in plants in dominant, there are  two  possible genotype combinations that will produce a tall plant:  Homozygous: TT Heterozygous: Tt            Why did Mendel get when he crossed a tall and short pea plant?  what Mendel got is two tall plants, im guessing i got that from a science book so               JPG1000  73 Contributions      The crossing of homozygous tall pea plants with homozygous short pea plants always resulted in tall plants and demonst?  Homozygous tall pea plants chromosomes are TT and short pea plants are tt. (You can use whatever letters you like, as long as dominate traits are capitalized and recessive lower-cased.) A heterozygous tall pea plant is Tt. This is resulted because the F1 generation takes one chromosome from the tall plant (T) and one from the short plant (t). So you can see only Tt is possible.               Ramkishore Singh Rathore  9,008 Contributions  Ph. D., F. B. S. is Ex- Head of Botany Department, R B S College, Agra and Ex- Principal Government College, Port Blair      The allele for tall pea plants is dominant over the allele for short pea plants what must be true for a cross between a tall plant and a short plant to reproduce any short plants?  The short plant must be homozygous recessive i. e. tt as against TT and Tt.               Neodarwinian  16,472 Contributions      If a homozygous tall and short pea plant are crossed will the offspring be of medium height?  Not if either trait is dominant. Let us say tall is dominant ( I think it is ) and short is recessive. T = tall, and s = short.    TT X ss    will give heterozygous tall plants.

Either TT or Tt, where T stands for dominant gene for tallness andt for recessive gene.               Arkarian 23  747 Contributions      What is the probability of producing a tall plant from genetic cross between two short pea plant?  Assuming the gene/allele for a tall plant is dominant and short is recessive this is an impossibility. As in order for both parent plants to be short both chromosomes must contain the t (allele for short) and so the T (allele for tall) cannot be present and will not be passed on to the offspring and it cannot be tall.            What did mendel predict was the probability of producing a tal plant from a genetic cross of two hybrid tall piants?  because he is only person who predict the probability of tall and short plants is tall plant was 3 in 4 and the short plant was 1 in 4            Why is a pea plant that is a hybrid for stem height tall?  The tall gene is dominant in pea plants and there is no inbetween. This made them an ideal for Gregor Mendel to study in his study of genetic inheritance.               Brieannak  57 Contributions      When mendel crossed a strain of tall pea plants with a strain of short pea plants he observed that all of the plants in the F generation were tall this suggests that?  All of the offspring had at least one dominant tall allele.    All of the offspring in the F1 generation were heterozygous "Tt" meaning they each had one tall allele "T" and one short allele "t".   It also suggest that one parent was homozygous tall TT and the other was homozygous short "tt."               LauraMargaret  71 Contributions      What size pea plants would result when two short plants are crossed?  I think you're talking about Mendel's famous pea plant study. It's not the size that matters, but rather the genotype. The parents have to possess a certain pair of chromosomes to create a specific phenotype (short plants).  Here's your answer: Let's use  T  to represent the dominant trait of tallness, and  t  to represent a recessive trait of shortness. If both parents are short plants, their genotype would have to be  tt  (dominant could be  TT  or  Tt ). So when you crossed their chromosomes for offspring, their genotypes would also be  tt . Therefore, the phenotype would be short.            If a homomzygous tall pea plant and a homozygous short pea plant are crossed?  You will get plants whose phenotype, or appearance, is tall, but whose genotype, or genetic makeup, has one tall gene and one short gene. If T=tall and t=short, all of the resulting plants will have the genotype Tt. They appear to be tall because the tall gene is dominant over the short gene, but can still pass the short gene on if they are crossed with other pea plants.               ilovecatz1234 .  26,613 Contributions      What is the genotype of heterozygous tall pea plants?  Considering that tallness is the dominant trait, the genotype of a heterozygous tall pea plant is Tt.               Ramkishore Singh Rathore  9,008 Contributions  Ph. D., F. B. S. is Ex- Head of Botany Department, R B S College, Agra and Ex- Principal Government College, Port Blair      What is the probable genotype for the two parents of a cross between two pea plants?  Crossing between two parents is done to combine noble characters of parents into the next generation. Suppose a dwarf pea plant has better quality of pods and its tall counterpart has more number of pods per plant then a plant breeder may think of combining these two characters into its hybrid. The genotype for these tall & dwarf parents with variable pod quality and quantity may be designated as - Tall parent --- ppTT   & dwarf parent -- PPtt               Eddie humbert  22 Contributions      Can a short pea plant ever be produce from crossing two tall pea plants?  yes, supposing tall is 'T' and short is 't', if two tall plants that were both Tt were crossed, the would produce one TT, two Tt (carrying the short gene) and one tt.      Yes, two heterozygous tall plants could produce short pea plants.               Boomracoon16  6 Contributions      What happend when mendel crossed purbred tall plants with purbred short pea plants?  I believe they were genetically altered to form a mix of tall/short plants, instead of purebred tall and purebred short pea plants.               maría fernanda  1 Contribution      How did Mendel cross pollinate his pea plants?  He accomplished cross pollination by cutting away the pollen-bearing male parts and then dusting pollen from another plant onto the flower.               Neodarwinian  16,472 Contributions      What is the probability of producing a tall pea plant fro a genetic cross between two hybrid tall pea plants?  Since tall is dominant in pea plant I would say 100% probability of tall pea plant production.            When purebred tall plants are crossed with hybrid tall plants what happens to the offspring?  Using a punnett square you get the results of TT, TT, Tt, Tt. Key= T-tall t-short  It's going to be tall but can have different genotypes            When Mendel crossed a pure tall pea plant with a pure short pea plant he concluded it was dominant trait he further concluded the trait for shortness was?  When you mix the genes, you get 4 possible combinations (T=tall, S=Small):    TT   TS   ST   SS    because of TT and SS, one quarter of all resulting plants are going to be tall, another quarter short. The remaining half is made by TS (and the identical ST). If you have three quarters tall plants in all, the TS plants have become tall, so tall is dominant (same for 3/4 short). If half of the plants are middle sized, tall and short are called co-dominant, so mixing the genes als produces an in-between trait.            Can a short pea plant ever be produced from crossing two tall pea plants?  Yes, it can be produced. By crossing two heterozygous tall plants (Tt x Tt), there is 25% chances of getting a short pea plant.               Ramkishore Singh Rathore  9,008 Contributions  Ph. D., F. B. S. is Ex- Head of Botany Department, R B S College, Agra and Ex- Principal Government College, Port Blair      What are the genotypes of a homozygous tall pea plant and a heterzygous tall pea lant respectively?  Tall is a dominant trait.    So homozygous for tall is TT and heterozyous for tall is Tt. Both plants are phenotypically tall.               Meave Gilchrist  24,958 Contributions  "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood." Marie Curie      What crosses between two hybrid Tt pea plants?  A cross between two hybrid Tt pea plants would be expected to produce 1/4 TT, 1/2 Tt, and 1/4 tt offspring.               Answers Publisher  49,340 Contributions      What offspring is produced if a heterozygous n tall pea plant is crossed with a homozygousfor this trait what percent of the offspring will be heterozygous?  If a heterozygous tall pea plant, Aa, is crossed with a homozygous plant, AA, for the trait, you will have a one in one in four chance of the offspring being heterozygous. You will need to create a square and plug the traits in to see what the odds are.               Aaron Gong  160 Contributions      What is the combination alleles in purebred tall of pea plant?  Most teachers will designate the dominant gene capital letter. In Mendel's experiment he crossed purebred Tall (T) with purebred short (t). He got all Tall plants as a result. Tall purebreed genotype is TT and the resulting generation was all tall by heterozygous with a genotype of Tt.            When Mendel crossed a pure breeding tall pea plant with a pure breeding short pea plant all of the resulting plants were tall In this case the tall gene was and the short gene was?  This means that the tall pea plant had a double dominant heightgene (each gene has 2 parts, one from each "parent"). The short peaplant had a double recessive gene making it short. When the twoplants bread, the dominant gene always is the one that shows up, sothe plant was tall.               Mc Grumpy  7,049 Contributions      How tall should pea plant stakes be?  The same height as the final height of the variety of pea you are growing. This information will be on the seed packet.            What are the genotypes of s homozygous and a heteroxygous tall pea plant?  If we see a white guinea pig, it's genotype must be "bb". If you look at a pea plant & it is short, its genotype must be "tt". You bump into a two-eyed purple people eater on your way to the mall, its genotype for eyes is "ee", because we all know that in purple people eaters the dominant trait is one eye (EE or Ee).            A pea plant has a tall stem what are its possible genotypes-?  Is tall dominant? You didn't say. Let's assume it is. Therefore, as long as a dominant allele is one of the two alleles an organism has for every trait, and we let "R" stand for dominant tall and 'r' stand for recessive short, then either an RR or Rr genotype will result in a tall phenotype.

It sounds like you're talking about Mendelian Genetics. ;-)    If by hybrid pea you mean heterozygous, then you're look at two Aa genotypes, ya? So if you just set up your Punnett square...    (Hopefully the formatting will hold)    A a   ---------------------   A| AA Aa   a| Aa AA     So you get 2 phenotypes! 75% of the offspring will be tall plants (because AA, Aa, and Aa will all produce tall plants), and 25% of the offspring will be short plants (only AA can produce short plants).    But if you think your plants are homozygous (AA), then you'll only get 1 phenotype, they'll all be just like the parent plants (tall)!            A gardener has two tall pea plants. How can the gardener determine whether they are homozygous dominant or heterozygous for the gene determining the plant?  It would be homozygous dominant because the offspring were both tall so the genotypes would both be TT (Tall).               Robertybob  10 Contributions      In pea plants if tall plants are dominant to short plants and two heterozygous tall plants are crossed what percent of the offspring will probably be short?  Because heterozygous means that the parents contain both dominant and recessive genes the offspring will be 75% tall and 25% short. If you were to draw the punnett squares you would see that there are 3 possible children one with only dominant tall traits two with both dominant and recessive traits and one with only recessive traits.               Jashadow  230 Contributions      What happened when Gregor Mendel crossed homozygous tall pea plants with homozygous short pea plants?  When Gregor Mindel crossed homozygous tall plants with homozygous short plants,he got hetrozygous tall plants.. 
Tall plants will dominate any small pea plants in the same area. The traits for tall were dominant over short traits. Perhaps both alleles can code for protein, but the dominant product is expressed in the phenotype.            How did Mendel cross fertilize his pea plants?  Mendel took the pollen from one pea flower and put it onto anothers pistil. In order for there to be no other pollination, he covered them with protective bags, he also moved some into a greenhouse.               ChrissyBear  38 Contributions      Can a short pea plant ever be a hybrid?  No, the short pea trait is recessive and the tall pea plant trait is dominant. This means that if the plant is a hybrid, it has to be a tall pea plant. The dominant traits "mask" the recessive traits. The plant take one trait from their mom and one from their dad. If either the mom or the dad was not a tall, not hybrid pea plant then their kids would have to be tall be cause they would have one dominant, tall trait               Antonette Davis  267 Contributions      When Mendel mated tall pea plants with short pea plants what kind of pea plants did he get in the first generation?  The results of the first generation were 3 tall plants and 1 short plant, indicating that some activity was making the tall plants more likely, but not exclusively so.            What is the probability of producing a tall pea plant from a genetic cross between two hybrid tall pea plants?  Tt xTt gives 3 Tall (Tt, Tt, TT) :1 short (tt) =  3 in 4. .               ChrissyBear  38 Contributions      Can a short pea plant ever be a hybrid why or why not?  No, the short pea trait is recessive and the tall pea plant trait is dominant. This means that if the plant is a hybrid, it has to be a tall pea plant. The dominant traits "mask" the recessive traits. The plant take one trait from their mom and one from their dad. If either the mom or the dad was not a tall, not hybrid pea plant then their kids would have to be tall be cause they would have one dominant, tall trait.               Shabooboo  266 Contributions      What are the genotypes of a homozygous and a heterozygous tall pea plant?  \nThe word genotypes is in reference to the alleles an individual receives at fertilization. \n. 
\nLets say that the allele/gene/trait, genotype for the Tall plant is T and dominate and the allele/gene/trait genotype for the short plant is t and recessive.  \n. 
\nIf the genotype is an homozygous allele/gene/trait has two dominate alleles/genes/traits seen as two capital letters ex: dominate tall=TT or if the genotype is homozygous with two recessive alleles/genes/traits it will have two lower case letters ex: short=tt. \n. 
\nIf the genotype is heterozygous is a Tall plant that means the allele/gene/trait will have one dominate T=Tall and one recessive t=short and it will look like this Tt and with this genotype a Tall plant will be produce "T", even though that plant will still carry an allele/gene/trait for shortness "t".\n.

do you go to MHS?            What happened when Mendel crossed purebred tall pea plants with purebred short pea plans?  He got a tall plant. The tall gene is a dominant trait so when he crossed them he got a tall instead of a small.               Stevekim012  16,501 Contributions      If a homozygous tall pea and a homozygous short pea plant are crossed?  The resulting offspring will be 25% tall homozygous, 25% short homozygous, or 50% heterozygous. Depending on the gene, the heterozygous will either have codominance, incomplete dominance, normal dominance depending on which gene is dominantly expressed.            When a homozygous tall pea plant and a homozygous short pea plant cross what happens?  put TT on top of the box then put tt on the side and divide the box into 4 pieces then the top left box with be TT and the top right will be Tt and the bottom left will be Tt and the bottom right will be tt then it will be 75% tall and 25% short               GeekLove  2 Contributions      Show the cross between a heterozygous tall pea plant and a homozygous short pea plant?  If a plant that is heterozygous tall (Tt) is crossed with a plant that is homozygous short (tt) the cross would look something like this (Tt x tt). 
T t. 
t Tt tt. 
t Tt tt. 
50 percent of offspring produced would be heterozygous tall and the other 50 percent would be homozygous short.               Meave Gilchrist  24,958 Contributions  "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood." Marie Curie      What are the genotypes of a heterozygous tall pea plant?  The genotype is heterzygous, meaning that there are two different alleles. If you want to use letters to represent the tall and short alleles, you could use T for tall (capital letter indicates a dominant allele), and t for short (lowercase letter indicates a recessive allele). So the heterozygous genotype for a tall pea plant could be indicated by Tt.               John Doe  275 Contributions      If a pea plant has a recessive allele for green peas what will it produce?  A recessive allele means that the gene codes for an nonfunctional enzyme. If the pea plant has 2 recessive allele for the green pea gene, that means that the green pigment will not be deposited on the peas, as the enzyme is nonfunctional. The result would be yellow coloured peas.  If the pea plant has one recessive and one dominant allele for the green pea pigment, then it will result in a half functional enzyme, which is sufficient for the green pigment to be deposited.            What can a yellow pea plant and a green pea plant produce?  A yellow pea plant (Yy) and a green pea plant (yy) could produce ______ green phenotype(s) in offpspring               Qubbyb  20 Contributions      Can a pea plant ever be a hybrid?  Yes it can. It can be heterozygous for a trait such as height. However, because there are so many traits it has, it can easily be crossed with other plants and form hybrids.            Describe what happened when mendel crossed purebred tall plants with purebred short pea plants?  he made a table to show what kind a plane he will get he used T for tall and t for short               Wildly Alex  32,794 Contributions      What are the possible genotypes for tall pea plants?  Because the Tall gene in plants in dominant, there are  two  possible genotype combinations that will produce a tall plant:  Homozygous: TT Heterozygous: Tt            Why did Mendel get when he crossed a tall and short pea plant?  what Mendel got is two tall plants, im guessing i got that from a science book so               JPG1000  73 Contributions      The crossing of homozygous tall pea plants with homozygous short pea plants always resulted in tall plants and demonst?  Homozygous tall pea plants chromosomes are TT and short pea plants are tt. (You can use whatever letters you like, as long as dominate traits are capitalized and recessive lower-cased.) A heterozygous tall pea plant is Tt. This is resulted because the F1 generation takes one chromosome from the tall plant (T) and one from the short plant (t). So you can see only Tt is possible.               Ramkishore Singh Rathore  9,008 Contributions  Ph. D., F. B. S. is Ex- Head of Botany Department, R B S College, Agra and Ex- Principal Government College, Port Blair      The allele for tall pea plants is dominant over the allele for short pea plants what must be true for a cross between a tall plant and a short plant to reproduce any short plants?  The short plant must be homozygous recessive i. e. tt as against TT and Tt.               Neodarwinian  16,472 Contributions      If a homozygous tall and short pea plant are crossed will the offspring be of medium height?  Not if either trait is dominant. Let us say tall is dominant ( I think it is ) and short is recessive. T = tall, and s = short.    TT X ss    will give heterozygous tall plants.    Ts               MUHAMMAD AFZAL  422,269 Contributions  DOUBLE GOLD MEDALIST FROM UNIVERSITY OT THE PUNJAB PAKISTAN . PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY . TEACHING AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 26 YEARS .      If two heterozygous tall pea plants are crossed what would the expected genotypic ratio of the offspring be?  1:2:1, one would be TT , two would be Tt and one would be tt .               Ramkishore Singh Rathore  9,008 Contributions  Ph. D., F. B. S. is Ex- Head of Botany Department, R B S College, Agra and Ex- Principal Government College, Port Blair      What are the possible genotypes of a tall pea plant?  Either TT or Tt, where T stands for dominant gene for tallness andt for recessive gene.               Arkarian 23  747 Contributions      What is the probability of producing a tall plant from genetic cross between two short pea plant?  Assuming the gene/allele for a tall plant is dominant and short is recessive this is an impossibility. As in order for both parent plants to be short both chromosomes must contain the t (allele for short) and so the T (allele for tall) cannot be present and will not be passed on to the offspring and it cannot be tall.            What did mendel predict was the probability of producing a tal plant from a genetic cross of two hybrid tall piants?  because he is only person who predict the probability of tall and short plants is tall plant was 3 in 4 and the short plant was 1 in 4            Why is a pea plant that is a hybrid for stem height tall?  The tall gene is dominant in pea plants and there is no inbetween. This made them an ideal for Gregor Mendel to study in his study of genetic inheritance.               Brieannak  57 Contributions      When mendel crossed a strain of tall pea plants with a strain of short pea plants he observed that all of the plants in the F generation were tall this suggests that?  All of the offspring had at least one dominant tall allele.    All of the offspring in the F1 generation were heterozygous "Tt" meaning they each had one tall allele "T" and one short allele "t".   It also suggest that one parent was homozygous tall TT and the other was homozygous short "tt."               LauraMargaret  71 Contributions      What size pea plants would result when two short plants are crossed?  I think you're talking about Mendel's famous pea plant study. It's not the size that matters, but rather the genotype. The parents have to possess a certain pair of chromosomes to create a specific phenotype (short plants).  Here's your answer: Let's use  T  to represent the dominant trait of tallness, and  t  to represent a recessive trait of shortness. If both parents are short plants, their genotype would have to be  tt  (dominant could be  TT  or  Tt ). So when you crossed their chromosomes for offspring, their genotypes would also be  tt . Therefore, the phenotype would be short.            If a homomzygous tall pea plant and a homozygous short pea plant are crossed?  You will get plants whose phenotype, or appearance, is tall, but whose genotype, or genetic makeup, has one tall gene and one short gene. If T=tall and t=short, all of the resulting plants will have the genotype Tt. They appear to be tall because the tall gene is dominant over the short gene, but can still pass the short gene on if they are crossed with other pea plants.               ilovecatz1234 .  26,613 Contributions      What is the genotype of heterozygous tall pea plants?  Considering that tallness is the dominant trait, the genotype of a heterozygous tall pea plant is Tt.               Ramkishore Singh Rathore  9,008 Contributions  Ph. D., F. B. S. is Ex- Head of Botany Department, R B S College, Agra and Ex- Principal Government College, Port Blair      What is the probable genotype for the two parents of a cross between two pea plants?  Crossing between two parents is done to combine noble characters of parents into the next generation. Suppose a dwarf pea plant has better quality of pods and its tall counterpart has more number of pods per plant then a plant breeder may think of combining these two characters into its hybrid. The genotype for these tall & dwarf parents with variable pod quality and quantity may be designated as - Tall parent --- ppTT   & dwarf parent -- PPtt               Eddie humbert  22 Contributions      Can a short pea plant ever be produce from crossing two tall pea plants?  yes, supposing tall is 'T' and short is 't', if two tall plants that were both Tt were crossed, the would produce one TT, two Tt (carrying the short gene) and one tt.      Yes, two heterozygous tall plants could produce short pea plants.               Boomracoon16  6 Contributions      What happend when mendel crossed purbred tall plants with purbred short pea plants?  I believe they were genetically altered to form a mix of tall/short plants, instead of purebred tall and purebred short pea plants.               maría fernanda  1 Contribution      How did Mendel cross pollinate his pea plants?  He accomplished cross pollination by cutting away the pollen-bearing male parts and then dusting pollen from another plant onto the flower.               Neodarwinian  16,472 Contributions      What is the probability of producing a tall pea plant fro a genetic cross between two hybrid tall pea plants?  Since tall is dominant in pea plant I would say 100% probability of tall pea plant production.            When purebred tall plants are crossed with hybrid tall plants what happens to the offspring?  Using a punnett square you get the results of TT, TT, Tt, Tt. Key= T-tall t-short  It's going to be tall but can have different genotypes            When Mendel crossed a pure tall pea plant with a pure short pea plant he concluded it was dominant trait he further concluded the trait for shortness was?  When you mix the genes, you get 4 possible combinations (T=tall, S=Small):    TT   TS   ST   SS    because of TT and SS, one quarter of all resulting plants are going to be tall, another quarter short. The remaining half is made by TS (and the identical ST). If you have three quarters tall plants in all, the TS plants have become tall, so tall is dominant (same for 3/4 short). If half of the plants are middle sized, tall and short are called co-dominant, so mixing the genes als produces an in-between trait.            Can a short pea plant ever be produced from crossing two tall pea plants?  Yes, it can be produced. By crossing two heterozygous tall plants (Tt x Tt), there is 25% chances of getting a short pea plant.               Ramkishore Singh Rathore  9,008 Contributions  Ph. D., F. B. S. is Ex- Head of Botany Department, R B S College, Agra and Ex- Principal Government College, Port Blair      What are the genotypes of a homozygous tall pea plant and a heterzygous tall pea lant respectively?  Tall is a dominant trait.    So homozygous for tall is TT and heterozyous for tall is Tt. Both plants are phenotypically tall.               Meave Gilchrist  24,958 Contributions  "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood." Marie Curie      What crosses between two hybrid Tt pea plants?  A cross between two hybrid Tt pea plants would be expected to produce 1/4 TT, 1/2 Tt, and 1/4 tt offspring.               Answers Publisher  49,340 Contributions      What offspring is produced if a heterozygous n tall pea plant is crossed with a homozygousfor this trait what percent of the offspring will be heterozygous?  If a heterozygous tall pea plant, Aa, is crossed with a homozygous plant, AA, for the trait, you will have a one in one in four chance of the offspring being heterozygous. You will need to create a square and plug the traits in to see what the odds are.               Aaron Gong  160 Contributions      What is the combination alleles in purebred tall of pea plant?  Most teachers will designate the dominant gene capital letter. In Mendel's experiment he crossed purebred Tall (T) with purebred short (t). He got all Tall plants as a result. Tall purebreed genotype is TT and the resulting generation was all tall by heterozygous with a genotype of Tt.            When Mendel crossed a pure breeding tall pea plant with a pure breeding short pea plant all of the resulting plants were tall In this case the tall gene was and the short gene was?  This means that the tall pea plant had a double dominant heightgene (each gene has 2 parts, one from each "parent"). The short peaplant had a double recessive gene making it short. When the twoplants bread, the dominant gene always is the one that shows up, sothe plant was tall.               Mc Grumpy  7,049 Contributions      How tall should pea plant stakes be?  The same height as the final height of the variety of pea you are growing. This information will be on the seed packet.            What are the genotypes of s homozygous and a heteroxygous tall pea plant?  If we see a white guinea pig, it's genotype must be "bb". If you look at a pea plant & it is short, its genotype must be "tt". You bump into a two-eyed purple people eater on your way to the mall, its genotype for eyes is "ee", because we all know that in purple people eaters the dominant trait is one eye (EE or Ee).            A pea plant has a tall stem what are its possible genotypes-?  Is tall dominant? You didn't say. Let's assume it is. Therefore, as long as a dominant allele is one of the two alleles an organism has for every trait, and we let "R" stand for dominant tall and 'r' stand for recessive short, then either an RR or Rr genotype will result in a tall phenotype.
