Gregor Mendel Define: feritilization the process in which reproductive eggs (egg from the female and sperm from the male) join to produce a new cell Define: trait a specific characteristic, such as (in peas) seed color and or plant height Mendel prevented _________ in the peas. He controlled fertilization so he could study how traits passed from one generation to the next self-pollination Define: hybrids crossed between true-breeding parents with different traits For the pea plant experiment, the hybrids were the ____ (first filial) generation. They each showed the characteristic of only one parent F1 Mendel found that traits are controlled by factors that pass from parent to offspring. Those factors are ____. genes Mendel allowed members of the F1 generation to self-pollinate. The trait controlled by the _____ allele appeared in the next generation (F2) in about 1/4 of the offspring - even when it did not appear in the F1 generation. recessive Define: segregation the separation of alleles When ____ (sex cells) form, alleles segregate so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene gamete The F2 generation gets a new combination of ____: one from each parent allele Specific characteristics that vary among individuals traits The offspring of true-breeding parents with different traits hybrids Factors that determines traits genes Sex cells, egg or sperm gametes The different forms of a gene alleles Why are peas a good model system for studying heredity? They are small, easy to grow, and they produce large numbers of offspring How did Mendel cross-pollinate flower? He removed the male parts from one flower and dusted their pollen (containing sperm) onto the female parts of another flower. What is the difference between a gene and an allele? A gene is a factor that passes from parent to offspring and determines a trait. An allele is one form of a gene. State the principle of domiance Some alleles are dominant and some are recessive. An organism with one dominant allele for a trait (heterozygous/hybrid) will exhibit that from of the trait. Dominant alleles mask/hide recessive alleles What is segregation? What is the result of segregation? Segregation is the separation of alleles during the formation of gametes (meiosis). The result is that each gamete carries only one allele for a gene A black cat and a white cat have four black kittens in the F1 generation. In the F2 generation, there are three black kittens and one white kitten. Explain how the F2 generation proves that genetic information passes unchanged from one generation to the next, even when a specific trait is not exhibited. The trait produced by a pair of recessive alleles (white fur) was not exhibited in the individuals of the F1 generation, but reappeared in one fourth of the F2 offspring. That proves the genetic information was never lost, even though it was not expressed Probability predicts the _____ of alleles recombination Of an allele pair, the probability of each allele in a gamete is what? 1/2 or 50% Organisms that have two identical alleles for a gene are ____ for that trait. homozygous Organisms that have different alleles for a gene are ____ for that trait. heterozygous Physical traits are an organism's what? phenotype An organism genetic makeup is its what? genotype Define: Punentt Square A mathematical tool that helps predict combinations in genetic crosses What is probability? The likelihood that a particular event will occur In a parent pea plant with the allele pair of Gg, what is the probability that one gamete will contain the G allele? 1/2 or 50% What is the characteristics of a homozygous genotype? Both alleles are the same What is the characteristics of a homozygous phenotype? The alleles can be either dominant or recessive What is the characteristics of a heterozygous genotype? The alleles are different What is the characteristics of heterozygous phenotype? The allele must be dominant What is the probability of a homozygous recessive individual (ss) producing a gamete with a dominant allele (S)? Explain. The probability is zero because this individual did not inherit a dominant allele State the principle of independent assortment below Genes for different traits segregate independently during the formation of gametes The Punnett square predicts a 9:3:3:1 ratio for phenotypes. Explain what that ratio means. It means that the probability of an offspring that exhibits both dominant traits (green pod and smooth pod shape) is 9/16. The probability of one dominant and one recessive trait (either greed pod color and constricted shape OR yellow pod and smooth shape) is 3/16. The probability of both recessive traits showing in the phenotype (yellow color and constricted shape) is 1/16. The units that determine the inheritance of biological characteristics are ____. genes A form of a gene is a(n) ____. allele If two or more forms of a gene exist, some may be dominant and other may be ___ recessive The offspring of most sexually reproducing organisms have two copies of each gene. One came from each ___. parent Alleles from different genes usually ____ independently from each other when gametes form. segregate Determine traits genes Can be two of these in one gene alleles Allele that is expressed dominant Where genes come from parents Explain the importance of Thomas Hunt Morgan's experiments with fruit flies. Why was his work an important addition to Mendel's research. He experimented with fruit flies instead of plants. He was the first to discover that Mendel's principles apply to organisms other than plants Four sisters begin attending your school. One has brown hair and brown eyes. Another has brown hair and blue eyes. The third also has blue eyes, but blond hair. The fourth has blond hair, too, but she has brown eyes. Explain how the principle of independent segregation accounts for these sisters having four different phenotypes for two traits If their parents are heterozygous for both traits, the genes and alleles segregate independently, resulting in all possible phenotypes combinations: dominant-dominant, dominant-recessive, recessive-dominant, and recessive-recessive Some alleles are neither ___ or ____ dominant or recessive In cases of ____ ____, neither allele is completely dominant over the other. The phenotype is a blend of the two homozygous phenotypes. incomplete dominance In cases of ____, both alleles in the heterozygous genotype are expressed in the phenotypes codominance Genes with ____ ____ have more than two forms of the same gene. There may be more than one dominant form and several different phenotypes multiple alleles ____ ____ are controlled by the interaction of two or more genes and exhibit a wide range of phenotypes polygenic traits The phenotype of an organism results only partly from its ____. _____ _____ can affect how genes are expressed. environmental conditions Mendel's experiments cannot predict the outcome of traits that involve what? Incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, and polygenic traits Example of Incomplete domiance pink flowers from red and white parents Example of Codomiance Speckled chicken feathers from solid-color-feather parents Examples of multiple alleles Four different coat (fur) colors on rabbits and human blood type Example of Polygenic traits Variety of skin color in humans True or False. When offspring show a blend of the parents' traits, one allele is dominant over the other False. When offspring show a blend of the parents' traits, neither allele is dominant over the other True or False. In complete dominance, the heterozygous phenotype lies somewhere between the two homozygous phenotypes. False. In incomplete dominance, the heterozygous phenotype lies somewhere between the two homozygous phenotype True or False. A heterozygous individual that exhibits the traits of both parents is an example of codominance. True True or False. Many genes exist in several forms and are said to have codominant alleles. False. Many genes exist in several forms and are said to have multiple alleles True or False. While multiple alleles may exist in a population, an individual usually carries only two alleles for each gene True True or False. Traits produced by two or more genes are codominant. False. Traits produced by two or more genes are polygenic traits True or False. Polygenic traits often show a wide range of phenotypes True If the offspring had been red and blue spotted flowers, what kind of inheritance would be most likely? codominance Explain the difference between multiple alleles and polygenic traits Multiple alleles are more than two different forms of the same gene. Polygenic traits are traits produced by the interaction of several genes (each of which may or may not have multiple alleles) An organism's ____ results from its genotype and its environment phenotype Some ____ produce variable traits depending on environmental conditions genes Western white butterflies vary in their wing color because their _____ varies depending where they hatch environment _____ is an environmental variable that affects wing color in western white butterflies. temperatures Genotype or Environment. Turtles whose eggs hatch at higher temperatures tend to be female Environment Genotype or Environment. A blue-eyed girl is born to two blue eyed parents. Genotype Genotype or Environment. Bees in a colony are assigned different jobs. As they develop, workers begin to look dramatically different. Environment Genotype or Environment. A pair of twins is separated at birth. They grow up in different countries and speak different languages. Environment Genotype or Environment. A litter of puppies is born. They are all gray, except one, which is brown. Genotype Genotype or Environment. Tall pea plant seeds are planted in different locations around a yard. They produce plants of different heights. Environment Genotype or Environment. A kitten is born with six toes. Genotype Genotype or Environment. A rabbit is born weak with hunger Environment A dog gave birth to four puppies. The father has brown eyes, and the mother has green eyes. Two puppies have brown eyes. One has green eyes. One puppy has blue eyes. What does this tell you about how the cellular information for eye color is passed on? Explain. In Mendelian genetics, these puppies would all have brown eyes. However, they have a wide variety of eye color, including blue, which is NOT expressed in the parents. This tells me that eye color in this breed is not a matter of simple dominance. Eye color must be either a polygenic trait or its genes must have multiple alleles or both __________ chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that correspond in body cells. One chromosome from each pair comes from each parent. Homologous A cell that contains both sets of homologous chromosomes has a ______ number of chromosomes (meaning "two sets"). diploid _________ cells contain only one set of chromosomes. Gametes are _____. haploid What is meiosis? the process that separates homologous pairs of chromosomes in a diploid cell, forming a haploid gamete. What are the phases of meiosis? Meiosis I : Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase 1, and Telophase I Meiosis II: Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II, and Cytokinesis What happens in Meiosis I? Meiosis I, which is preceded by a replication of chromosomes What happens in Prophase I? Each replicated chromosome pairs with its corresponding homologous chromosome forming a tetrad. During tetrad formation, alleles can be exchanged between chromatids, a process called crossing-over. What happens in Metaphase I? Each replicated chromosome pairs with its corresponding homologous chromosome forming a tetrad. During tetrad formation, alleles can be exchanged between chromatids, a process called crossing-over. What happens in Anaphase I? Spindle fibers pull each homologous pair toward opposite ends of the cell What happens in Telophase I? A nuclear membrane forms around each cluster of chromosomes. Cytokinesis then occurs, resulting in two new cells. The resulting daughter cells contain chromosome sets that are different from each other and the parent cell. What happens in Meiosis II? Chromosomes do not replicate What happens in Prophase II? Chromosomes, each consisting of two chromatids, become visible What happens in Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II, and Cytokinesis? These phases are similar to meiosis I. Four haploid cells form. They are the gametes. During fertilization, two gametes unite forming a zygote. Alleles tend to be inherited together if they are located on the same ______. chromosome _____, not genes, segregate independently. chromosomes The _____ apart genes are on a chromosome, the more ____ is cross over. farther; likely True or False. The offspring of two parents obtains a single copy of every gene from each parent. True True or False. A gamete must contain one complete set of genes. True True or False. Genes are located at specific positions on spindles. False. Genes are located at specific positions on chromosomes. True or False. A pair of corresponding chromosomes is homozygous. False. A pair of corresponding chromosomes is homologous True or False. One member of each homologous chromosomes pair comes from each gene. False. One member of each homologous chromosomes pair comes from each parent True or False. A cell that contains both sets of homologous chromosomes is haploid. False. A cell that contains both sets of homologous chromosomes is diploid True or False. The gametes of sexually reproducing organisms are haploid. True True or False. If an organism's haploid number is 6, its diploids number is 3. False. If an organism's haploid number is 6, its diploids number is 12 Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? Each replicated chromosome pairs with its corresponding homologous chromosome. Prophase I Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? Crossing-over occurs between tetrads. Prophase 1 Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? Paired homologous chromosomes line up across the center of the cell. Metaphase I Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? Spindle fibers pull each homologous chromosome pair toward an opposite end of the cell. Anaphase I Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? A nuclear membrane forms around each cluster of chromosomes and cytokinesis follows, forming two new cells. Telophase I Which stage of meiosis I or II is this ?Chromosomes consist of two chromatids, but they do not pair to form tetrads. Prophase II Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? A nuclear membrane forms around each cluster of chromosomes and cytokinesis follows, forming four new cells. Telophase II Compare mitosis and meiosis: Form of reproduction Mitosis: asexual Meiosis: sexual Compare mitosis and meiosis: Number of daughter cells Mitosis: 2 Meiosis: 4 Compare mitosis and meiosis: Change in chromosome number Mitosis: no change; stays diploid Meiosis: cut in half to haploid Compare mitosis and meiosis: Number of cell divisions Mitosis: 1 Meiosis: 2 Compare mitosis and meiosis: Difference in alleles between parent cells and daughter cells Mitosis: None Meiosis: Each of the four daughter cells is genetically difference from the parent A diploid cell that enters mitosis with 16 chromosomes will divide to produce _____ daughter cells. Each of these daughter cells will have ____ chromosomes. 2; 16 If the diploid number of chromosomes for an organism is 16, each daughter cell after mitosis will contain ____ chromosomes. 16 A diploid cell that enter meiosis with 16 chromosomes will pass through ___ cell divisions, producing ___ daughter cells, each with ____ chromosomes. 2; 4; 8 Gametes have ____ number of chromosomes haploid If an organism's haploid number is 5, its diploid number is _____. 10 While a haploid number can be even or odd, a diploid number is always _____. even What did Thomas Hunt Morgan discover that seemed to violate Mendel's principles? Some genes appeared to be linked; they seemed to violate the principle of independent assortment. How did Morgan explain his finding? Linked genes were inherited together because they were close to each other on the same chromosome. How did Alfred Sturtevant use gene linkage to create gene maps? He reasoned that alleles that frequently cross over must be farther apart than those that hardly ever cross over. Some housecats have orange fur with darker orange stripes. The traits of these tabby cats are usually seen in male cats. Tortoiseshell cats have patches of many different colors. "Torties," as they are called, are almost always female. What does this tell you about the way cellular information about color and sex are passed on in cats? It tells me that the genes for color and sex are linked. The genes for these two traits must be located on the same chromosome.

Gregor Mendel Define: feritilization the process in which reproductive eggs (egg from the female and sperm from the male) join to produce a new cell Define: trait a specific characteristic, such as (in peas) seed color and or plant height Mendel prevented _________ in the peas. He controlled fertilization so he could study how traits passed from one generation to the next self-pollination Define: hybrids crossed between true-breeding parents with different traits For the pea plant experiment, the hybrids were the ____ (first filial) generation. They each showed the characteristic of only one parent F1 Mendel found that traits are controlled by factors that pass from parent to offspring. Those factors are ____. genes Mendel allowed members of the F1 generation to self-pollinate. The trait controlled by the _____ allele appeared in the next generation (F2) in about 1/4 of the offspring - even when it did not appear in the F1 generation. recessive Define: segregation the separation of alleles When ____ (sex cells) form, alleles segregate so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene gamete The F2 generation gets a new combination of ____: one from each parent allele Specific characteristics that vary among individuals traits The offspring of true-breeding parents with different traits hybrids Factors that determines traits genes Sex cells, egg or sperm gametes The different forms of a gene alleles Why are peas a good model system for studying heredity? They are small, easy to grow, and they produce large numbers of offspring How did Mendel cross-pollinate flower? He removed the male parts from one flower and dusted their pollen (containing sperm) onto the female parts of another flower. What is the difference between a gene and an allele? A gene is a factor that passes from parent to offspring and determines a trait. An allele is one form of a gene. State the principle of domiance Some alleles are dominant and some are recessive. An organism with one dominant allele for a trait (heterozygous/hybrid) will exhibit that from of the trait. Dominant alleles mask/hide recessive alleles What is segregation? What is the result of segregation? Segregation is the separation of alleles during the formation of gametes (meiosis). The result is that each gamete carries only one allele for a gene A black cat and a white cat have four black kittens in the F1 generation. In the F2 generation, there are three black kittens and one white kitten. Explain how the F2 generation proves that genetic information passes unchanged from one generation to the next, even when a specific trait is not exhibited. The trait produced by a pair of recessive alleles (white fur) was not exhibited in the individuals of the F1 generation, but reappeared in one fourth of the F2 offspring. That proves the genetic information was never lost, even though it was not expressed Probability predicts the _____ of alleles recombination Of an allele pair, the probability of each allele in a gamete is what? 1/2 or 50% Organisms that have two identical alleles for a gene are ____ for that trait. homozygous Organisms that have different alleles for a gene are ____ for that trait. heterozygous Physical traits are an organism's what? phenotype An organism genetic makeup is its what? genotype Define: Punentt Square A mathematical tool that helps predict combinations in genetic crosses What is probability? The likelihood that a particular event will occur In a parent pea plant with the allele pair of Gg, what is the probability that one gamete will contain the G allele? 1/2 or 50% What is the characteristics of a homozygous genotype? Both alleles are the same What is the characteristics of a homozygous phenotype? The alleles can be either dominant or recessive What is the characteristics of a heterozygous genotype? The alleles are different What is the characteristics of heterozygous phenotype? The allele must be dominant What is the probability of a homozygous recessive individual (ss) producing a gamete with a dominant allele (S)? Explain. The probability is zero because this individual did not inherit a dominant allele State the principle of independent assortment below Genes for different traits segregate independently during the formation of gametes The Punnett square predicts a 9:3:3:1 ratio for phenotypes. Explain what that ratio means. It means that the probability of an offspring that exhibits both dominant traits (green pod and smooth pod shape) is 9/16. The probability of one dominant and one recessive trait (either greed pod color and constricted shape OR yellow pod and smooth shape) is 3/16. The probability of both recessive traits showing in the phenotype (yellow color and constricted shape) is 1/16. The units that determine the inheritance of biological characteristics are ____. genes A form of a gene is a(n) ____. allele If two or more forms of a gene exist, some may be dominant and other may be ___ recessive The offspring of most sexually reproducing organisms have two copies of each gene. One came from each ___. parent Alleles from different genes usually ____ independently from each other when gametes form. segregate Determine traits genes Can be two of these in one gene alleles Allele that is expressed dominant Where genes come from parents Explain the importance of Thomas Hunt Morgan's experiments with fruit flies. Why was his work an important addition to Mendel's research. He experimented with fruit flies instead of plants. He was the first to discover that Mendel's principles apply to organisms other than plants Four sisters begin attending your school. One has brown hair and brown eyes. Another has brown hair and blue eyes. The third also has blue eyes, but blond hair. The fourth has blond hair, too, but she has brown eyes. Explain how the principle of independent segregation accounts for these sisters having four different phenotypes for two traits If their parents are heterozygous for both traits, the genes and alleles segregate independently, resulting in all possible phenotypes combinations: dominant-dominant, dominant-recessive, recessive-dominant, and recessive-recessive Some alleles are neither ___ or ____ dominant or recessive In cases of ____ ____, neither allele is completely dominant over the other. The phenotype is a blend of the two homozygous phenotypes. incomplete dominance In cases of ____, both alleles in the heterozygous genotype are expressed in the phenotypes codominance Genes with ____ ____ have more than two forms of the same gene. There may be more than one dominant form and several different phenotypes multiple alleles ____ ____ are controlled by the interaction of two or more genes and exhibit a wide range of phenotypes polygenic traits The phenotype of an organism results only partly from its ____. _____ _____ can affect how genes are expressed. environmental conditions Mendel's experiments cannot predict the outcome of traits that involve what? Incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, and polygenic traits Example of Incomplete domiance pink flowers from red and white parents Example of Codomiance Speckled chicken feathers from solid-color-feather parents Examples of multiple alleles Four different coat (fur) colors on rabbits and human blood type Example of Polygenic traits Variety of skin color in humans True or False. When offspring show a blend of the parents' traits, one allele is dominant over the other False. When offspring show a blend of the parents' traits, neither allele is dominant over the other True or False. In complete dominance, the heterozygous phenotype lies somewhere between the two homozygous phenotypes. False. In incomplete dominance, the heterozygous phenotype lies somewhere between the two homozygous phenotype True or False. A heterozygous individual that exhibits the traits of both parents is an example of codominance. True True or False. Many genes exist in several forms and are said to have codominant alleles. False. Many genes exist in several forms and are said to have multiple alleles True or False. While multiple alleles may exist in a population, an individual usually carries only two alleles for each gene True True or False. Traits produced by two or more genes are codominant. False. Traits produced by two or more genes are polygenic traits True or False. Polygenic traits often show a wide range of phenotypes True If the offspring had been red and blue spotted flowers, what kind of inheritance would be most likely? codominance Explain the difference between multiple alleles and polygenic traits Multiple alleles are more than two different forms of the same gene. Polygenic traits are traits produced by the interaction of several genes (each of which may or may not have multiple alleles) An organism's ____ results from its genotype and its environment phenotype Some ____ produce variable traits depending on environmental conditions genes Western white butterflies vary in their wing color because their _____ varies depending where they hatch environment _____ is an environmental variable that affects wing color in western white butterflies. temperatures Genotype or Environment. Turtles whose eggs hatch at higher temperatures tend to be female Environment Genotype or Environment. A blue-eyed girl is born to two blue eyed parents. Genotype Genotype or Environment. Bees in a colony are assigned different jobs. As they develop, workers begin to look dramatically different. Environment Genotype or Environment. A pair of twins is separated at birth. They grow up in different countries and speak different languages. Environment Genotype or Environment. A litter of puppies is born. They are all gray, except one, which is brown. Genotype Genotype or Environment. Tall pea plant seeds are planted in different locations around a yard. They produce plants of different heights. Environment Genotype or Environment. A kitten is born with six toes. Genotype Genotype or Environment. A rabbit is born weak with hunger Environment A dog gave birth to four puppies. The father has brown eyes, and the mother has green eyes. Two puppies have brown eyes. One has green eyes. One puppy has blue eyes. What does this tell you about how the cellular information for eye color is passed on? Explain. In Mendelian genetics, these puppies would all have brown eyes. However, they have a wide variety of eye color, including blue, which is NOT expressed in the parents. This tells me that eye color in this breed is not a matter of simple dominance. Eye color must be either a polygenic trait or its genes must have multiple alleles or both __________ chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that correspond in body cells. One chromosome from each pair comes from each parent. Homologous A cell that contains both sets of homologous chromosomes has a ______ number of chromosomes (meaning "two sets"). diploid _________ cells contain only one set of chromosomes. Gametes are _____. haploid What is meiosis? the process that separates homologous pairs of chromosomes in a diploid cell, forming a haploid gamete. What are the phases of meiosis? Meiosis I : Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase 1, and Telophase I Meiosis II: Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II, and Cytokinesis What happens in Meiosis I? Meiosis I, which is preceded by a replication of chromosomes What happens in Prophase I? Each replicated chromosome pairs with its corresponding homologous chromosome forming a tetrad. During tetrad formation, alleles can be exchanged between chromatids, a process called crossing-over. What happens in Metaphase I? Each replicated chromosome pairs with its corresponding homologous chromosome forming a tetrad. During tetrad formation, alleles can be exchanged between chromatids, a process called crossing-over. What happens in Anaphase I? Spindle fibers pull each homologous pair toward opposite ends of the cell What happens in Telophase I? A nuclear membrane forms around each cluster of chromosomes. Cytokinesis then occurs, resulting in two new cells. The resulting daughter cells contain chromosome sets that are different from each other and the parent cell. What happens in Meiosis II? Chromosomes do not replicate What happens in Prophase II? Chromosomes, each consisting of two chromatids, become visible What happens in Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II, and Cytokinesis? These phases are similar to meiosis I. Four haploid cells form. They are the gametes. During fertilization, two gametes unite forming a zygote. Alleles tend to be inherited together if they are located on the same ______. chromosome _____, not genes, segregate independently. chromosomes The _____ apart genes are on a chromosome, the more ____ is cross over. farther; likely True or False. The offspring of two parents obtains a single copy of every gene from each parent. True True or False. A gamete must contain one complete set of genes. True True or False. Genes are located at specific positions on spindles. False. Genes are located at specific positions on chromosomes. True or False. A pair of corresponding chromosomes is homozygous. False. A pair of corresponding chromosomes is homologous True or False. One member of each homologous chromosomes pair comes from each gene. False. One member of each homologous chromosomes pair comes from each parent True or False. A cell that contains both sets of homologous chromosomes is haploid. False. A cell that contains both sets of homologous chromosomes is diploid True or False. The gametes of sexually reproducing organisms are haploid. True True or False. If an organism's haploid number is 6, its diploids number is 3. False. If an organism's haploid number is 6, its diploids number is 12 Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? Each replicated chromosome pairs with its corresponding homologous chromosome. Prophase I Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? Crossing-over occurs between tetrads. Prophase 1 Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? Paired homologous chromosomes line up across the center of the cell. Metaphase I Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? Spindle fibers pull each homologous chromosome pair toward an opposite end of the cell. Anaphase I Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? A nuclear membrane forms around each cluster of chromosomes and cytokinesis follows, forming two new cells. Telophase I Which stage of meiosis I or II is this ?Chromosomes consist of two chromatids, but they do not pair to form tetrads. Prophase II Which stage of meiosis I or II is this? A nuclear membrane forms around each cluster of chromosomes and cytokinesis follows, forming four new cells. Telophase II Compare mitosis and meiosis: Form of reproduction Mitosis: asexual Meiosis: sexual Compare mitosis and meiosis: Number of daughter cells Mitosis: 2 Meiosis: 4 Compare mitosis and meiosis: Change in chromosome number Mitosis: no change; stays diploid Meiosis: cut in half to haploid Compare mitosis and meiosis: Number of cell divisions Mitosis: 1 Meiosis: 2 Compare mitosis and meiosis: Difference in alleles between parent cells and daughter cells Mitosis: None Meiosis: Each of the four daughter cells is genetically difference from the parent A diploid cell that enters mitosis with 16 chromosomes will divide to produce _____ daughter cells. Each of these daughter cells will have ____ chromosomes. 2; 16 If the diploid number of chromosomes for an organism is 16, each daughter cell after mitosis will contain ____ chromosomes. 16 A diploid cell that enter meiosis with 16 chromosomes will pass through ___ cell divisions, producing ___ daughter cells, each with ____ chromosomes. 2; 4; 8 Gametes have ____ number of chromosomes haploid If an organism's haploid number is 5, its diploid number is _____. 10 While a haploid number can be even or odd, a diploid number is always _____. even What did Thomas Hunt Morgan discover that seemed to violate Mendel's principles? Some genes appeared to be linked; they seemed to violate the principle of independent assortment. How did Morgan explain his finding? Linked genes were inherited together because they were close to each other on the same chromosome. How did Alfred Sturtevant use gene linkage to create gene maps? He reasoned that alleles that frequently cross over must be farther apart than those that hardly ever cross over. Some housecats have orange fur with darker orange stripes. The traits of these tabby cats are usually seen in male cats. Tortoiseshell cats have patches of many different colors. "Torties," as they are called, are almost always female. What does this tell you about the way cellular information about color and sex are passed on in cats? It tells me that the genes for color and sex are linked. The genes for these two traits must be located on the same chromosome.
