  doi:10.3104/dsupdate.207  The likelihood of having non-identical twins runs in families. Women whose mothers, sisters, or aunts have had twins have an increased chance of having
  non-identical twins. The risk also increases with mother's age; a woman who gives birth at 37 is four times more likely to have non-identical twins than
  at age 18. Neither age nor family history seems to affect the incidence of identical twins, which account for about 4 per 1000 births worldwide. These
  figures only apply to spontaneous, or natural births. Assisted reproduction techniques, particularly ovarian stimulation, increase the risk of twins and
  multiple births.  Twins with Down syndrome  Twins or multiple births occur at a rate of about 2% in the population of 15,000 babies with Down syndrome recorded on the UK National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register . A total of 244 twin pairs are recorded (some prenatally
  diagnosed), including 29 pairs (11.8%) where both have Down syndrome. Nine sets of triplets are recorded, each with one affected child. In twin pairs where
  both have Down syndrome they may not be identical (from one egg), as one pair are a boy and a girl. In a small number of cases, the affected pregnancy was
  assisted using hormones.  These figures indicate that, in a group of 1000 babies with Down syndrome, some 14 or 15 babies will be a twin or a triplet, with their other
  twins/triplets unaffected, and 2 or 4 babies will be identical twin pairs, both with Down syndrome.  If we consider all births, we estimate that identical twins with Down syndrome occur at the rate of 1 or 2 in a million pregnancies and non-identical
  twins at the rate of 14/15 in a million. If the likelihood of having a twin or twins with Down syndrome is also linked to a family history of twins, to age
  or to assisted pregnancies, we presume these factors will play a part in increasing the risk for some individuals.   Resources:   National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine

The majority of the twins are going to be fraternal twin’s, which means that there were two eggs that were fertilized. This is different from identical twins, where one egg was able to separate into two eggs in order to become two distinct lives. Fraternal twins can be of either gender and they can be a combination of boys and girls. This is because they originate from separate conceptions.  Statistics About Fraternal Twins Gender  1. People who are a fraternal twin have a one in 17 chance of having twins themselves.  2. The odds of having three sets of twins that are fraternal are one in 500,000.  3. The odds of having one set of identity and one set of fraternal twins is one in 10,000.  4. Once a mother has twins, the chances of having another set of twins quadruples.  5. Fraternal twins occur in one out of every 90 live births.  6. Caucasian Americans have the greatest chances of having fraternal twins the birth rate of 14.5 in every 1000 births.  7. The Chinese have the lowest rates of fraternal twin births, occurring in just one in 250.  8. One out of every 50 people in the United States is a fraternal twin.  9. The most common position for twins during pregnancy is in the vertex position. This occurs in about 50% of pregnancies today.  10. Fraternal twins can be conceived at different times and they can be conceived by different fathers.  11. Up to 2% of the fraternal twins that are born today will actually have different fathers.  12. Fertility treatments are a common cause of having fraternal twins occurring during a pregnancy.  13. Diet, the age of the mother, and even birth-control pills can all influence the chances of having a multiple birth pregnancy. Many of these factors only impact fraternal twinning and not identical twinning.  14. The average length of pregnancy mother that has fraternal twins: 36 weeks.  15. Over 50% of twins are born before the 37th week.  16. About 35% of twins are left-handed. This is more than double the rate of the general population.  17. A woman named Mary Jonas, who died in 1899 had 15 sets of fraternal twins.  18. Rate in the United States over the past three decades: 70%.  19. In 2009, one out of every 30 babies that was born in the US was a twin.  20. About 40% of twins invent their own languages.  21. Research has documented that twin fetuses as early as 14 weeks begin to reach out for each other.  22. By 18 weeks, twins in the womb are in physical contact with each other about 30% of the time.  23. The combined age of the world’s oldest twins: 204.  24. In examining the records of over 59,000 women over 170 years, the University of Utah discovered that moms who have twins tend to live longer than moms you don’t have any.   Gender Chances with Fraternal Twins  The gender chances of a fraternal twin pregnancy are; 25% chance that a mother will have two boys, 25% chance that a mother will have two girls, and 50% chance that a mother will have a boy and a girl. On the other hand, identical twins are always the same gender. Whereas identical twins will be genetically seen, fraternal twins are genetically similar just like any other siblings would be. They share about half of their DNA with each other. That’s because each child receives half of their DNA from mom and half from dad.  What makes fraternal twins a joy to the families that have them is that they may or may not look alike. They might also act similar or act very differently. They can be as different as two siblings can be, but still be twins. They might have different hair colors, different statures, and different personalities. Because they are raised in the same home environment and share the same experiences, most fraternal twins wind up with more similarities overall than differences. This creates a lifelong close connection that other siblings are unable to experience.  By knowing the statistics about the gender of fraternal twins, we can all begin to understand this unique relationship a little bit more.      Chances of Having Multiples  It is true that having twins can be a challenge. There are twice as many mouths to feed. There are double the diapers. Yet there are also double the rewards and that is something that every parent can enjoy.  What is unique about the gender of fraternal twins is that you’ve got equal chances to get the gender combination that you want. You have a one third chance to have two boys, two girls, or one of each. No matter what the gender of the twins might be, there are still individual learning pathways that occur. One twin may be smart and aggressive, while the other twin might be shy and laid-back. That is the joy of parenting twins.  One of the less pleasant experiences of being the mother of a fraternal twins pregnancy is the increased level of morning sickness that occurs. This is most likely due to the increased levels of the hormone hCG because of the second fetus that is present. Having a fraternal twins pregnancy also requires a higher level of weight gain for many women, and by the 30th week, many mothers are already at the full gestation size of a single child pregnancy. This creates numerous challenges in regards to muscle strains, joint aches, and other physical ailments that can be extremely bothersome.  As most mothers will testify, however, having twins is a definite joy. It is not something that they would never trade any experiences are truly unique. There might be a lot of people who come up to the parents of twins to tell them that they have their hands full, but they have their hands full in a very good way.

Identical twins happen by accident. Your being an identical twin will not influence your chances of having twins. Non-identical twins are the result of the release of more than one EGG, so it can only run on the mother's side of the family. If your mother, sister, etc have non-identical twins, your chance is somewhat increased, because you might also be a multi-ovulator. But no, if you are an identical twin, you have the same chance as everyone else of having identical or non-identical twins.

I read that the probablity of twins having twins is the same as the general population.                 somersetmarine    Answered 9/3/07               11 found this helpful     I was just reading about this as this is my fourth pregnancy I&amp;#8217;m 10 weeks and showing much more than I did with my first three. I learned that although twins do run in families identical twins do not necessarily follow the same chances. Identical twins are created by the splitting of one embryo into two where twins are the result of multiple eggs during ovulation. The only &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; way to know is by ultrasound, although your Doctor can get an indication as to weather or not you could be carrying twins by the rate of growth of your uterus and by searching for multiple heartbeats by Doppler. For now breathe and ask your Doctor at your next visit, he or she should be able to tell you if you have merit for your concern by a quick examination.

Identical twins are caused by an embryo splitting and other twins are caused by a release of multiple eggs upon ovulation.                 melgill    Answered 9/2/07               6 found this helpful     For all of you who are mentioning your baby's father and his father and so on and so forth, just an FYI. Twins are made by the female and the female only. It's either cause by the release of two eggs or one egg splitting in two after fertilization.                 Ashley8402    Answered 9/11/07               6 found this helpful     The odds of having twins if you are a fraternal twin is higher than if you are an identical. From twin.com: The chances of having twins that are identical are approximately 1 in 250 or 0.4%. It is unknown as to why a fertilized egg splits to form identical twins. Identical twins do not run in families and there is no way to increase the probability of having them. 
So If you are an identical it was a fluke by your egg and if you are having identicals it would be purley Coincidental.                 JKnigge    Answered 9/14/07               6 found this helpful     I have to disagree with the REAL answer. My great aunts are identical twins. both of them have a set of identical twins. The tendency for eggs to split has to come from somewhere. So it is possible to be having twins. You would be able to ask your doctor to do an ultrasound to find out.

So any differences between twins are due to their environments, not genetics. Recent studies have shown that many environmentally induced differences are reflected in the epigenome. Nature AND Nurture  Chromosome 3 pairs in each set of twins are digitally superimposed. One twin&apos;s epigenetic tags are dyed red and the other twin&apos;s tags are dyed green.
When red and green overlap, that region shows up as yellow. The 50-year old twins have more epigenetic tags in different places than do 3-year-old twins.  The insight we gain from studying twins helps us to better understand how nature and nurture work together. For well over a century, researchers have compared characteristics in twins in an effort to determine the extent to which certain traits are inherited, like eye color, and which traits are learned from the environment, such as language. Typically taking place in the field of Behavioral Genetics, classical twin studies have identified a number of behavioral traits and diseases that are likely to have a genetic component, and others that are more strongly influenced by the environment. Depending on the study and the particular trait of interest, data is collected and compared from identical or fraternal twins who have been raised together or apart. Finding similarities and differences between these sets of twins is the start to determining the degree to which nature and environment play a role in the trait of interest.  Twin studies have identified some traits that have a strong genetic component, including reading disabilities like dyslexia. Other traits, like arthritis, are more likely influenced by the environment. Twin studies uncover genetic and environmental contributions  Twins share the same genes but their environments become more different as they age. This unique aspect of twins makes them an excellent model for understanding how genes and the environment contribute to certain traits, especially complex behaviors and diseases.  For example, when just one twin gets a disease, researchers can look for elements in the twins&apos; environments that are different. Or when both twins get a disease, researchers can look for genetic elements shared among similar twin pairs. These types of data are especially powerful when collected from large numbers of twins. Such studies can help pinpoint the molecular mechanism of a disease and determine the extent of environmental influence, potentially leading to the prevention and treatment of complex diseases. To illustrate, for twins with schizophrenia, 50% identical twins share the disease, while only about 10-15% of fraternal twins do. This difference is evidence for a strong genetic component in susceptibility to schizophrenia. However, the fact that both identical twins in a pair don&apos;t develop the disease 100% of the time indicates that other factors are involved.   Identical twins (left) share all their genes and their home environment. Fraternal twins (right) also share their home environment, but only half of their genes. So a greater similarity between identical twins for a particular trait compared to fraternal twins provides evidence that genetic factors play a role.   Comparing Identical and Fraternal Twins: A higher percentage of disease incidence in both identical twins is the first indication of a genetic component. Percentages lower than 100% in identical twins indicates that DNA alone does not determine susceptibility to disease. References References Wong A.H., Gottesman I., Petronis A.

And if you are having fraternals, your chances essentially double as kproeger points out. In other words, at age 35 your risk is around 1 in 270, but if you have fraternals your risk is more like 1 out of 130. This is why most OBs recommend CVS or amnio testing for fraternal pregnancies even if the mom is younger than 35. www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0815/p825.html .

Blood work wasn't too far off "normal.". After 14 weeks of stressing and a ton of ultrasounds, I did the new MaterniT21 test that examines fetal dna in the mother's blood. Turned out my boys have typical chromosomes and they are now 8weeks old and happy and healthy!  Check out the test if you want a definitive answer without amnio risks.

This was 1st trimester screening, so not totally applicable to you, but my point is that I do think the testing results are thrown off with twins. I wish I would not have stressed so much for those three weeks....I think my twins would be better off to this day if I had not been under that kind of stress. But fortunately both are extremely healthy and right on for development (though size wise they are still on the small side at 11 months in the 5 percentile).

These tests only indicate probabilities and are not diagnostic. Our twins each had a 1:90 chance of DS  (dear son) based on the 2nd trimester ultrasound, so I understand that when you are given increased probabilities it feels like a problem has been identified, but this is not true. It is certainly possible that your results are inaccurate or inflated because you are having multiples, but even if they are accurate, there is a 90% chance that there is no abnormality. If you haven't already, I would recommend that you post this on the Down Syndrome Pregnancy board. They are a great resource regarding these tests.

And I agree with snm317, you have an indicator - but that's all it is.  Does that mean there's a higher chance of Downs? It may, but it's just a chance.  One thing I learned during my pregnancy (where the doctors were giving me dire predictions throughout) is not to worry until there is something to worry about.  Chances of something wrong are just chances - they do not mean that there is something wrong.  We were told that there was something genetically wrong with baby A, when we ruled that out, they said it must be her heart, when we ruled that out, they said it must be TTTS - none of them ever happened.  So, I know it's hard, but try not to worry when there's just an indicator - because it doesnt necessarily mean that something is wrong.

I guess that's what a lot of his patients go for, but my gut reaction was to keep both babies. Since then, I've done a lot of crying, thinking about how hard life will be and about the little boy I would have had. How different things will be. I'm just about past feeling sorry for myself, and am more focusing on my little boy who will just have more challenges in life. It's still been a very emotional week though, and I'd appreciate any words of support anyone has.

I didn't find out about my daughter having DS  (dear son) until after she was born. In some ways I think that was easier because she was already here to love. There will be moments that might seem hard. You will have another baby the same age that will possibly reach milestones first. However they will learn off each other and be so close I'm sure, which will be so lovely! My daughter is almost 6 months old and the main thing I want to say to you is to reassure you that although this isn't what you planned for your child or for you, but that doesnt mean it will be bad! It is natural to grieve and cry, but try not to stress over things you cannot control, or over the unknown. I feared the worst when bubs was born. But so far she is doing everything a bubba should. She's smiling and cooing and rolling. She is such a joy. Your little boy will be wonderful and both your children will be lucky to have you               Reply            Report this comment       0                     aaguil20    Posted 07/13/2011      i wish so badley to go back and hug that girl in the delievery room crying over her baby girl.

Things will be different, but probobly not as different as you are anticipating. (granted my guy is only 20 months old.) You are giving each of your babies the most amazing gift, a sibling. They will love each other unconditionally. They will still play, still fight, and still get into tons of trouble with eachother. Give yourself some time to comes to terms with the diagnosis, and get to know those babies and form an even stronger bond with them. Everything will be OK, better than ok!

Here is that link: http://downsyndromepregnancy.org/  I hope some of this info helps--one of the ladies on this board said "I never knew I wanted a child with DS  (dear son) until I had one"-- it couldn't be more true.  Also-- how amazing that you are having twins so that they will always have each other-- I think that is just awesome.

I imagine how difficult this is for you right now. We had a postnatal diagnosis so I can't relate directly, but I can say that it will all be so much easier when you have that little boy to snuggle! And I'd say you're doing great, anyway. That's a lot of adjustment to go through in a week. Go easy on yourself--you have time to get used to this. Know that we are here to help.

I am so jealous--always wanted twins! I had a birth diagnosis, but I completely understand your sadness, shock, and fears. We've all been through it. What I was not prepared for was how much I love this little boy....he takes my breath away. I'm only 6mo into this journey, but what an amazing one it's been so far.  I also recommend the book "Roadmap to Holland". I read it a few weeks after the diagnosis. There are some mommas on here with twins, so I am sure you will get lots of input on what life can look like for you and your babies.

Wonderful  I echo the recommendations about the pregnancy book - I can't put a direct link to my blog anymore (bc rules), but if you do want to go there, go to the disability: blogs and books tab on the homepage. LInks galore and some books that helped me (I especially loved Gifts and Expecting Adam).  When I was pregnant (we had an amnio; I knew), I connected with our local Down syndrome Connection. Excellent. I highly recommend that step - they also have books and other resources.  There are other mamas of twins on this board- I hope you can connect with them as well.

My boy/girl twins just turned 1 on June 18th and this has been the most amazing year of my life! It has been a total blur, but a wonderful blur! My daughter Avery was diagnosed at birth with Ds. It is crazy to me that we had over 20 ultrasounds and nothing ever showed up to cause any concern, but I really think it was all just meant to be. I did have an elevated risk in my blood work, but my NT scan was totally normal. All of my ultrasounds were normal as well. We opted not to do the amnio, because my twins were so active. My doctor was very good, but due to their high level of activity, he was very honest and told us that he could not predict how the other twin would move and if he ruptured a sac we would end up losing both babies. Selective reduction was never an option for us and it took me so long to get pregnant that we were not willing to take the risk. We were very fortunate Avery was born with out any major health issues, and I carried she and Jack to 37 weeks 5 days (no bed rest!! woohoo! and worked until the week before they arrived!). I had a c-section due to 2 breech babies, and we were home in 4 days.  We were of course shocked with A's diagnosis at birth, however, we were very quickly told the best gift we could have ever given her was a twin brother. And this has proved to be so true! Their bond is amazing and it really has been this way since day one. Avery is very motivated by Jack and really does want to keep up with him. Of course now that we are at a year and Jack is pretty much walking I do see some delays, but for the most part she has hung right with him and even did some things before he did!! I sometimes get sad when I see how hard she has to work to do some things that come so easy to him, but she just keeps on plugging along.  It is really cute now that he is mobile b/c he always looks back over his shoulder to make sure Avery is following him!  They really do love each other so much! In fact when we cheer him on and say "Go, Jack!" when he walks she gets such a big smile and claps for him. Brings me to tears to watch her excitement for him!  Of course they also have their typical brother and sister moments! He LOVES to pull her glasses off of her face and bows out of her hair. BUT she is a pacifier swiper and will snatch it right out of his mouth and pop it into hers before he can even do anything about it. It makes me laugh to watch them interact.  Things were tricky when I started back to work full time (I am an elem. school counselor), but we made it through the school year. With twins in daycare someone is always sick. I felt like I lived at my pediatricians office some weeks, but we all made it through the first winter. Avery of course has more appts. than Jack, but we make it work. She of course also has PT, OT, Speech, and an Educator, but for the most part all of our therapist have worked to incorporate Jack into her therapy whenever possible. We just redid her IFSP plan with our EI team and things are going to get a little hectic, but I think we can make it work. As a Mom I sometimes worry I am not getting enough 1 on 1 time with each of them... especially Jack, but they both seem happy at this point.  The thing with twins is if these are your first children you don't know any different! Our motto is simple.... JUST DO IT! haha! I will not lie there are moments when being a twin Mom and having a child with Ds can be overwhelming, but it has really made me dig down deep and realize that I have "mom strength" that I never knew I had. Just believe in yourself and always trust your instincts. I often find myself saying the Serenity Prayer and it always seems to calm me when I am losing my balance.  Feel free to touch base with me anytime regarding my experience with twins and Ds. I never walked down your path of having the prenatal diagnosis, but I can relate to the twin thing and Ds in general. I can give you feedback on the twin gear and what I have found helpful.  Hang in there! Take care of yourself and those awsome little twins. Get rest now, because when they arrive be ready to hold on tight for a wonderful and amazing adventure!!!! Just wait until you see the bond they have.... pure L-O-V-E!!!! Hope you find some peace in this stressful time.               Reply            Report this comment        1               / 3      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

Do you know how your odds were determined?  Generally there is a formula, where your age, your blood test results, and ultrascreen finding are all combined together to get a "number" which is your odds.  What week are you now?  Was the 1 in 30 from the combination of first trimester blood and early scan, or is the 1 in 30 from a second semester blood screen alone?  Good luck on your testing.  P.S.  Ultrasounds can also pick up anotomical issues that may not be genetically linked.    --  Nancy, mom of 4 girls DownSyndromePregnancy.org : free pregnancy book; free booklet for friends & relatives             Reply            Report this comment       0                     littlemari    Posted 09/29/2009      Just wanted to say Congratulations and thank you for giving me hope that i so need at the moment, i am 39 and my 12 week nuchal scan showed a 1 in 14 chance for genetic abnormality, they didn't give me any blood tests or the usual triple marker test . I went to the hospital where i was booked for an early aminocentisis ( the one where they take a tiny bit of the placenta for testing and you get the results very quickly) but the doctors said the placenta was in a bad position and it was too risky so now i need to wait 2 weeks till there's more aminotic fuild for a normal aminocentisis and so now i face having to wait another month or more before i know and the wait is so long. i'm trying to remain positive but it gets so difficult at times so thankyou for posting this.

I have several friends of a similar age (41) who have had high risk triple test results - one was given a 1 in 10 chance - who have all had negative results from their amnio chromosomal testing.  Its important to remember the triple test is only about 60% accurate in detecting a possible problem. When I met with the genetic councillor she told me my AFP levels looked fine and that my high risk was purely due to my age!!!!

I am 13 weeks pregnant with twins and just got results from my first trimester screening with 1/59 odds of having a downs syndrome baby.  I am 41 which probably factors into the statistics.  The nuchal fold screening seemed good...baby A's measurement was 1.3 and baby B's measurement was 1.4 (both well below the 3.0 threshold).  I am wondering if anyone else had stats like this and went on to have a healthy baby?  I did do a harmony test but will not get those results for a few days and I am totally worried.  Thanks in advance.

It's great that their nuchal fold screening was within the threshold.

I had a 1/78 chance of it until they did the NT scan and then the blood test. After the NT scan the doctor told me that with the thickness being under 3.5 he wasnt concerned at all. But we took the test anyway. The results came back and I was told I have a 1/10,000 chance.   Oh and they were able to tell the gender of my twins since they were girls there was no Y detected                   Status: Offline                   Sep 18th, 2013, 22:07 PM   4       amjon    Other  Active BnB Member        Join Date: Aug 2010  Location: United States  Posts: 7,230        The blood tests are NOT accurate for twins (almost everyone that has them comes back "high risk" and obviously all twins are not high risk).  My MFM did not even order them.  She did the NT only (and the anatomy U/S also after).

I was told my chance of a false positive was as high as 20% by my perinatologist because they consider me 35 already since my 35th b-day is in Nov. 2013.   He even advised against it!  In fact, I know a girl also expecting high risk identicals who was told both babies have it and is struggling to be sure with an amnio needed next, plus a fetal echocardiogram and MRI.  Sounds like a fun pregnancy, right?  What if they don't even have it?  On top of that, she has worries about TTTS, IUGR, and TAPS!  Another real life friend was only 23 and told very high risk for Downs in 2002.  Her nuchal folds were higher than yours, I believe in 2 range.  She worried the whole pregnancy and was offered  termination at every appointment.  Daughter came out perfect and she was very upset with the doctors.  That daughter is now an amazing 11 year old without a single health problem and an A student in the talented and gifted program!!!  Our other question when deciding was what would we do with the info.  We would never abort so didn't feel it needed.  Hope I've explained why I refused the test based on my experience with my real life friend, it's very hard to imagine that you have it.  You also have a VERY high false positive chance compared to her at just 23.

Harmony I know hasn’t published enough data medical articles or journals for me to say one way or another as it is pretty hush about its research. They say they have it for twins but they will not provide proof. I requested their stats so I opted for both harmony and maternit21.  Maternit21 however, has published 25 Medical journals on twins and has done 4 studies.  My genetics doctor and myself chose to go with both and compare the results and they both came back with the same thing  Times change so fast within just a year when it comes to the medical field so make sure you do your research and are well informed.

While some parents may feel alone on that journey at first, there are actually many parents and siblings who have shared their stories about having twins or being a twin where one or both have Down syndrome.  Our Resources  See also: Preparing Your Other Children chapter in our book, “Diagnosis to Delivery: A Pregnant Mother’s Guide to Down Syndrome.”  More Articles/Resources  We will start off suggested resources by mentioning Jen Graf Groneberg’s book, Roadmap to Holland . Jen gave birth to twin boys, one with Down syndrome, and wrote of her early experiences.  Another resource is a blog by Eric Waksmunski, dad to twin boys with Down syndrome.  In addition, guest post by Vicki Vila on Amy Julia Becker’s “Thin Places” blog gives a unique and insightful perspective about fraternal twins where one has Down syndrome and the other does not. Vicki Vila’s blog can be found at www.modernmessy.wordpress.com .  Other articles about twins include the following:  Laura’s Love Project (2): Twice the Love  Twins with Down syndrome — our experiences  How often are children with Down syndrome twins? by Sue Buckley  Below are stories from a twin sibling and other parents who have twins where they specifically address common issues, such as birth plan changes, logistics of a twin birth and possible complications, potential differences in parenting that you see, and benefits and challenges of twins.    Parent Stories  Reflections from parents about raising twins when one or both have Down syndrome:  From Meghan who has two identical twin boys with Down syndrome: My name is Meghan and I am the very proud momma to identical twin boys, Casey and Connor, who both have Down syndrome. We did not get a diagnosis prenatally, and I remember so very well the feelings I had when the neonatologist looked at me and said, “We strongly suspect they both have Down syndrome.” I will never forget that feeling as long as I live. It was difficult to breathe, my heart hurt, my very being was crushed. It felt like I needed to be wrapped in bandages to hold together. I was beyond devastated. Quite honestly, I felt like the twins I had imagined and prayed for and loved for 9 months were dead. I mourned “those” twins and realized that I still had “my” twins — I had two very real — completely adorable, absolutely perfect babies that needed me. I took one look at my sons, and I realized with very concrete certainty that it didn’t matter to me if they had 10 heads and neon green skin. They were mine, and I loved them, and I would spend every moment of my life making sure they were happy.  I know this is hard. Actually “hard” is such a crap word for what you might be feeling now. It’s just there is not a better word I am aware of, but I want you to know with 100% certainty — you are so blessed .  There are challenges ahead of you. I know nothing about the double bubble as my guys have no health issues, but I know Down syndrome. I know that for every new skill they will work harder than other kids. But I also know that when they master something new, there is this incredible feeling of wonder that you will experience. I will never forget the first time Connor sat up from a laying position by himself. It was December 4th, 2010, on his first birthday. I had turned my back to finish a sign for the yard, and I turned around and he was sitting up, and he looked so proud. I screamed with joy and startled him so that he fell over. I cried. We hugged. Great day. Casey mastered the same skill 3 days later, and I had the same reaction. My point is — your twins will do everything that other kids do — they will just do it a little slower, and you get to savor it and enjoy it and be thrilled. Sometimes I feel lucky that my boys have Down syndrome. My friends with babies the same age miss out on so much. Their kids just did everything so quickly they never got to enjoy the new stuff. With Casey and Connor I get to watch them learn something, master it, and then move on. When I post it on Facebook, my friends and family share that joy right along with me.  My life is normal. Well, as normal as life can be with twin toddler boys. There are honestly times I don’t even think about the Down syndrome. I spend more time trying to get them to eat something other than graham crackers and goldfish than I do thinking that they are different.  Right now you have a lot to think through. You are facing a future that you are not certain about with medical issues on top of it. I know that you are dealing with a ton. You might cry a million more tears, you might get mad and want to yell, you may be depressed, you may feel like I did and feel like you need to mourn the loss of the girls you have been dreaming about and planning for. (In my dreams I had one football star and one baseball star and they were both going to get full ride scholarships and give me lots of grandbabies — I dream big !) You take this time to feel what you feel. Nothing you feel is wrong. Nothing you think is wrong. Just know that once your twins get here, you will fall in love with them. You will look at their little almond shaped eyes or their little singly creased palms and stare in wonder and think, “How did I get so lucky?” You will realize more joy than you have ever known. Life with extra chromosomes is more beautiful than I would have ever thought and I am a far better person because I got chosen for this journey.  From Bruce who has a girl/boy set of twins where the son has Down syndrome: I have a girl/boy set of twins and my son was diagnosed with Down syndrome. We did not have the amnio, so was unaware. And am glad I opted not to. He is a joy, and they truly compliment each other. It has not been easy, but what total child birth, upbringing, etc. is?  From Darlene who has a fraternal twin sister with Down syndrome:  My sister and I are twins. She was born with Down Syndrome. We are 47 working on 48 in September. Just wanted to reassure you how special it is. She is such a blessing to me. My life is complete with her. I have learned so very much from her, and I thank God everyday for sending her with me. Or – for sending me with her.  From Sharla who has fraternal twin boys, including one with Down syndrome:  I have fraternal twin boys … one with Down syndrome. I had a birth diagnosis. I was really nervous about having twins in the first place (I have two girls too). Then when they told me one of my sons had Down syndrome, I just thought I would never be able to do it. But almost 2 years in, and it works! My son with Down syndrome is the love of my life. He is such an easy going boy. His twin is a fireball, so they compliment each other so well. And they adore each other. I love having twins much to my surprise!  From Terry who has identical twin girls with Down syndrome and heart defects: My identical twin daughters, Susan and Meredith, are turning two today!  We had an amnio after learning that both babies had an AVSD, a congenital heart defect with a strong probability that there was also DS. These are the hard days. Knowing – letting go of that hope that maybe the girls would not also have this – was so hard. Add to that all the prenatal twin stuff and the heart condition.  We didn’t know then how wonderful and amazing our lives would be because of this. What we thought was the loss of our lives as we knew them has instead transformed and changed our lives. I never knew how much otherness was out there, how much love is in this world, how much kindness and compassion and strength exist among my family, my friends, and so many people that I have met through our girls.  Please know that we were there with you at this moment. We chose to continue because we knew that some of the most rewarding expereinces in our lives have been the most challenging ones. Our girls are our proof – what we saw as the toughest challenge is our best reward, only two years in. We have grown and changed and loved so much more. It is my hope for you, too.

Are twins at higher risk of down syndrome??             Molly1090    Posted 15/05/2013       I can't remember if I have posted on here about this before. But it's been really playing on my mind recently! My mw seems very concerned about the risk of down syndrome in this pregnancy, even fast tracking me to see a consultent. I haven't even had my 12 week scan yet!! And she was the 2nd mw to say to me that I need to see a consultent about down syndrome ASAP. Are twins at increased risk or something??

I found out I was having mcda twins on my 12 week scan. I had previosly asked for the test where they measure babies neck. However I was in that much shock I didn't think anything of it when the sonographer said it was difficult to measure because there where two. All I wanted to do was run off and get my head around having twins as I was really upset at the time but as soon as I come out of the scan a mw dragged me in asking about the down syndrome test and did I want it still, if so I was to come back at a week later. She had a leaflet about Down syndrome Dow with twins and was telling me it was more complicated to test twins as the readings can be FALSE or one could have it and one may not?? At the time I just wanted to get out it was all to soon my oh was in the waiting room so I didn't even get to see his reaction to the news. Looking back now I feel like I was rushed into deciding (I chose not to have the test) but im the same as you I keep thinking what if.

I went for a second scan yesterday but babies were lying funny so couldn't do it. If it puts your mind at ease at all the sonographer said there was nothing that'd point to there being a problem, its just more difficult to see in twins.

I am having the blood test done and scan where they check the fluid behind the neck. But then it sounds like false high risk results are more common with twins, so maybe it would be best not to have the screening test at all? Oooh I wish I knew what to Do!

Downs is chromosomes and is u have none identical twins it was 2 eggs that were fertilised. IFC like me they were identical then it's that one egg spilt. This is how it was explained to me as was told the tests can be very inaccurate with twins due to the higher levels of everything.

I hadn't expected to be offered the blood tests as id read it wasn't accurate with twins. I discussed this with mw. She said that results are accurate but i needed to ask myself how i would deal with wondering if we were high risk. She explained that risks from amnio were greater with twins. So i decided it was best for us not to have the blood part done. Obviously still a worry but try not to think about it too much. At no point has anyone mentioned twins being higher risk for ds  (dear son) :-/ they were happy with my nt measurement and that was that x    --  ME 31 DH 32 DD(2006) DD2(2012) MMC(22/10/12) :( BFP 14/02/13 = TWINS!!

They were basically telling us that we could have the test, but it would only give is a guide to the risk. We were asked how we would feel if the risk was high, seeing as the invasive test to confirm whether one of the babies' had Downs would be risky for both twins. We said we wouldn't have the amnio for that reason. She said, well in that case, do you want to know the risk? If it's a it higher than normal, you will have that hanging over you your entire pregnancy, but you won't be able to confirm either way.  We agreed and therefore didn't have the blood test. xx    --  Non-identical twin girls Rosa and Amelie born on 23 July 2013.

Author information 1 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, and the Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, and the Genetic Disease Screening Program, California Department of Public Health, Richmond, California. Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the observed incidence of Down syndrome in twins compared with that expected based on maternal age-matched singletons, which is the current clinical approach. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of California Prenatal Screening Program participants with expected delivery dates between July 1995 and December 2012. Cases confirmed prenatally or postnatally with a genetic imbalance leading to phenotypic Down syndrome (trisomy 21, mosaic trisomy 21, or translocations) were included. Pregnancies conceived with ovum donation and women older than 45 years were excluded. We compared the observed Down syndrome incidence per pregnancy for twins with expected incidence by extrapolating from singleton data and expected zygosity as is the current clinical approach. This extrapolation assumes that monozygotic pregnancies have equivalent Down syndrome risk per pregnancy relative to maternal age-matched singletons and dizygotic pregnancies have twice the risk of at least one affected fetus. Zygosity for affected cases was presumed to be monozygotic with Down syndrome concordance and dizygotic with Down syndrome discordance. Counts were compared using cumulative Poisson distributions. RESULTS: Of 77,279 twin pregnancies, 182 (0.2%) had at least one fetus with Down syndrome confirmed by karyotype. The ratio of observed-to-expected Down syndrome incidence per pregnancy was 33.6%, 75.2%, and 70.0% for monozygotic, dizygotic, and all twins, respectively (P<.001 for all comparisons). Considering maternal age subgroups and twin zygosity, a significantly lower-than-expected Down syndrome incidence was seen for women aged 25 to 45 years with monozygotic pregnancies and overall for women aged 25 to 45 years with dizygotic pregnancies. CONCLUSION: The observed incidence of Down syndrome in twin pregnancies is lower than expected, most notably for monozygotic pregnancies and with increasing maternal age. Risk-based counseling can strongly affect women's choices regarding testing and management during pregnancy, so an understanding of the true Down syndrome risk in twin gestations is crucial.

Two-year-old Josh McIntosh and twin sister Cara race through the house while their mother Clare, 40, looks on. ‘I seem to spend all my days chasing after these two — but I love it,’ she says. But this picture of a happy family is not something Clare — a former marketing director, who lives with her husband John, 42, a finance manager, and older daughter Amelie, seven — takes for granted. For as she cradled her newborn twins after an exhausting day-long labour, Clare was given the news that every mother dreads: something was amiss with one of her babies.          The McIntosh twins: Josh - who was born with Down's syndrome (right) and his sister Cara (left) ‘I remember looking at the doctor incredulously, thinking: “In my heart, I know everything will be fine.” She said Josh had a single crease across his palm and this was a sign of Down’s syndrome.’ Within four hours, a stunned Clare was told that the diagnosis — caused by an additional chromosome, the building block of DNA — was extremely likely. ‘The doctors talked round the topic and I had to keep saying: “You mean Down’s syndrome, don’t you? That is what we are talking about,” ’ says Clare. ‘Looking down at my two babies dressed in matching white Babygros, they appeared perfect. I struggled to accept that one baby was being described as normal while the other was being labelled as abnormal. I felt hugely protective.

Share this article  Share     ‘Looking at Josh, his tiny life just beginning, as he nestled into me, the whole thing seemed impossible.’ The doctors explained the situation was rare. There are no official statistics on how often one of a set of twins will be Down’s, but on support networks Clare has only come across eight other families like hers. Research published in one medical journal found that in a group of 1,000 babies with Down’s, about 14 or 15 babies will be a twin or triplet, with their other siblings unaffected. It’s a hard enough situation for any mother to come to terms with the fact their child’s life will not be as they had hoped. But how does it feel when one twin will quickly outstrip the other, a reminder of what could have been?          Clare McIntosh — a former marketing director, who lives with her husband John, 42, a finance manager, older daughter Amelie, seven  (left) and the twins Josh (centre) and Cara (right) Clare is not in denial. She knows that while Josh’s quality of life is excellent now, his trajectory will not be as smooth as that of his sister. While the twins are toddlers, the differences between them can be surprisingly subtle, but as they grow up, Clare realises the difference in their development will become more obvious to all, including the twins themselves. ‘As they get older, the gap will increase and it is likely Cara will go to school a year before him, though we hope to keep him in mainstream education,’ she says. ‘But right now, the interaction between Josh and Cara is heart- melting. She sees him as any other playmate — she involves him in all her games and tries to wrestle him. ‘There are also times she tries to mother him. When she is given a sweet, she asks for one for Josh. When we are changing his nappy, she likes to hand us wipes for him. ‘Because he is likely to have delayed speech, we are learning to sign with him and Cara is adopting this enthusiastically. Both children know around 80 signs. When adults talk to our children, Cara will repeat in sign and sound simultaneously to ensure that Josh understands.’ Clare and John have thought further ahead, too. ‘We’ve explored some of the things he will face by talking to other families. Many young people with Down’s have some employment, such as working at a garden centre, and that would be fine. ‘But I’m sad he won’t be able to have children. Down’s causes infertility in men. However, I hope he finds a girlfriend, probably from within the disabled community.’          Clare had not long given birth to her twins when she was given the news that every mother dreads: something was amiss with one of her babies Clare’s attitude hides the fact that the couple struggled at first — her husband John was distraught. She had asked the midwife to take both babies into a side room while she broke the news. ‘In a way, that helped,’ she says. ‘As John came in, he saw the cots were missing and assumed something was seriously wrong with one or both of the babies — perhaps that one of them had died. ‘Telling him that Josh had Down’s was maybe easier as a result. ‘He still says that getting the news was the worst point of his life, even compared with hearing of his mother’s death a few years before.’ Their reaction, says Clare, was due in part to their lack of knowledge about the syndrome — there are only 40,000 people in Britain with Down’s. ‘The less you know about something, the more unnecessarily frightened you are,’ she says. ‘John probably took weeks to accept the news, because we didn’t understand what it meant or what children with Down’s are capable of. I think John thought Josh would be in a wheelchair or that we’d never go on holiday again. ‘He was bonding, but grieving for what we were expecting. We were never angry at our lot, just perplexed. ‘We had a very happy life with Amelie, so John questioned why we had decided to have more children — especially as we had undergone IVF.’ Clare met John in London and after they married in 2006, they immediately started trying for a family.          While the twins are toddlers, the differences between them can be surprisingly subtle, but as they grow up, Clare realises the difference in their development will become more obvious to all, including the twins themselves After four miscarriages, Amelie was conceived just before doctors were due to begin investigations, and was born in 2008. However, Clare was unable to conceive naturally a second time. Medical tests failed to find out why and the couple turned to IVF: first an £8,000 cycle in the UK and then two £2,500 cycles at a clinic called Gennet in Prague, which offered a third cycle for free if the first two failed. ‘Going through IVF was a huge strain. We weren’t eligible for NHS funding because we already had a child. We decided to see how it worked out in Prague and then call it a day if the IVF didn’t work there.’ The sperm and eggs were tested after collection by geneticists and nothing unusual was detected. ‘This isn’t surprising in the case of Down’s,’ says Clare. ‘The mutation seems to happen at the earliest cell division stage of conception, though no one really knows what triggers it.’ After four weeks, the couple were celebrating a positive pregnancy test. At seven weeks, they were merrily coming to terms with the idea of twins. What will surprise many was that Clare sailed through all the prenatal testing and scans, including the nuchal fold test, designed to highlight the prospect of abnormalities, at 12 weeks. ‘The tests analyse risk — they don’t diagnose for certain — but they suggested the chance of either twin having a chromosomal abnormality was very low. For Cara, it was one in 28,000, and for Josh, one in 5,500,’ she says (boys are generally more at risk). Neither the doctors at the Royal Berkshire Hospital or the couple were worried. ‘Almost everyone I knew came back with a risk of less than one in 300 — I knew someone whose risk had been calculated at one in 30 and all had been fine. Our twins’ results were different, but still low risk.’          Clare was scanned at least every four weeks — which is standard for twins in NHS hospitals — and the couple paid for additional tests to reassure themselves Additionally, Clare was scanned at least every four weeks — which is standard for twins in NHS hospitals — and the couple paid for additional tests to reassure themselves. Clare can’t explain why Down’s syndrome wasn’t detected, though she believes that doctors tend to look for problems such as a hole in the heart or bowel deformities, which can be common indicators for the syndrome, and Josh has neither. Has Clare asked herself what she would have done had the 12-week tests come back positive for Down’s? ‘I think we would have carried on,’ she says. When Clare did go into labour at 5.30am in July two years ago, she was premature at 35 weeks. ‘We were unlucky to get to hospital on a busy day, so instead of being taken to theatre and given an epidural with a view to a C-section, I found myself in an ordinary labour room, with just gas and air. Amelie had been relatively easy, so I had gone in very confident. But Josh came out first, and the labour had been slow to progress and very painful. I’ve later learnt this could have been due to his Down’s, as it causes poor muscle tone, so babies struggle to push their way through the birth canal. ‘My body went into shock, so the contractions stopped. Cara wasn’t born for another hour. Then both placentas got stuck, so I was on gas and air for four more hours until I could be taken into theatre so they could be removed surgically.’ A midwife noticed Josh was floppy due to poor muscle tone and left a message for the consultant to check the next day, but — as the first photographs confirm — it was not evident the babies differed from each other. It wasn’t until the next day Down’s was confirmed.          The McIntosh's situation is rare. Research published in one medical journal found that in a group of 1,000 babies with Down’s, about 14 or 15 babies will be a twin or triplet, with their other siblings unaffected ‘Apparently, 20 per cent of babies with Down’s are left in the hospital,’ says Clare, referring to infants abandoned by parents who cannot accept the reality of a diagnosis. ‘But that never crossed our minds. I think it was easier with him being a twin. We got the second child we wanted in Cara — the cake if you like. We consider Josh the cherry on the top.’ The first few weeks were a blur of tests and the couple were grateful to learn Josh was otherwise healthy with no additional birth defects. However, breaking the news to loved ones was less straightforward. ‘My mum said she had an inkling something would go wrong and she feared the worst. I think seeing Down’s like that is a generational attitude, though. ‘She associated it with children being hidden away who didn’t achieve very much. ‘Some of our friends were passing on the news for us, but we had to take control of that as there seemed to be an attitude of sorrow and we didn’t want that. We wanted them to understand about how positive we felt his life could be. ‘So we went on social media and explained that Josh was not ill or suffering — he was a happy and healthy baby. After that, everyone was hugely supportive.’ Another positive Clare took from the diagnosis was how well the health service is set up to support children with Down’s. ‘Because it is picked up so early, therapy begins immediately. Josh had his first physio session before we were discharged.’          Clare said she found it easier to accept her son had Down's as she was a twin: 'We got the second child we wanted in Cara — the cake if you like. We consider Josh the cherry on the top’ Two years later, he gets physical therapy for his muscle tone, but it is his speech that is Clare’s biggest concern. Local NHS provision allows for Josh to attend just three sessions of speech therapy a year, so Clare has set up a scheme with seven other mums called Chattertots, which provides weekly language support. Not everyone is kind. ‘Once someone told me gorillas have the single crease on their palms, too — I didn’t like that,’ says Clare. ‘And at Amelie’s school, some children were asking about my “son who is sick”. So I had to explain what Down’s means.’ Clare admits she worries that if plans for new, improved Down’s testing go ahead on the NHS as looks likely, more babies will be terminated at 12 weeks. She points out that almost all parents of children with Down’s are ‘overwhelmingly happy’ with their children. ‘We really didn’t know what it was two years ago, but our understanding has changed massively. It is a tragedy that people like Josh are being terminated every day, and I worry about the pressure people are put under to make the decision. ‘Being a parent means starting on a path where anything can happen. ‘When you have a baby, they are reliant on you, but there is this gradual sense of letting go.

My dr keeps telling me I need to get the down syndrome test..another dr told me the results are not clear with twins. My husband and I know it wouldn't make a difference either way. Is the test worth it? Does it prepare you or just add anxiety? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  14 Posts f  fivetobe @kyliemartindale  If you would terminate if they had downs, I would suggest you go for it. If you would keepThe pregnancy even if you got a 100% positive diagnosis, I'd say skip it. It really has a higher false positive rate with twins, and why cause yourself anxiety?I didn't do any testing. I wouldn't terminate regardless and would rather have a happy pregnancy in which something turns out wrong at the end than worry for 8 months and have it turn out yo be nothing, or even something. But I work in special education, so I have a different perspective than most. D  Divaette @kyliemartindale  I'm having twins and just did the testing yesterday. My goal was to have time to emotionally and financially prepare in case my children have downs. It by no means is based in the desire to terminate...just to have time for research and preparation. d  dipzinskie @kyliemartindale  If it wouldn't make a difference then why test? It wouldn't have mattered to us....we wouldn't have terminated...so why go through the stress and a potentially dangerous test (amniocentesis). z  zyxw @kyliemartindale  Well, it is a two-stage test. The first is blood work and then an ultrasound with an amniocentisis. You can always get the blood work done and then go from there. It really comes down to your reasoning. If you would terminate with a positive, then do it. If you wouldn't, then it depends on whether you want to be prepared beforehand. For me, we would want to know beforehand. We would have wanted to prepare emotionally and financially. I highly advise getting the blood work done and then go from there. At the very least, if you were to find out that one or both of your twins had Downs or any other issue, you would know beforehand.  t  twinsdue8312011 @mcgeelisha  I agree with the pp...it's not just about if you will terminate or not. In addition to being prepared emotionally and financially, your doctors can manage your care and anticipate higher risk situations if you know you may have a baby with some anomaly. For instance, you will receive echos and more intensive cardiac monitoring for a baby with downs syndrome. e  elleira22 @kyliemartindale  I agree with the suggestions given but I didn't choose to do it personally.  I would stick with the bloodwork like they are saying if it doesn't matter to you because the sampling of the fluid is much more risky with twins, the chances of miscarriage double, for obvious reasons.  My doctor strongly cautioned me against it for that reason when I told him that it didn't matter either way to me.  Plus like a pp said, it's not as accurate with twins anyway.  Now that I've said that though, go with your gut and do what will make you feel the most comfortable, escpecially if you want time to prepare yourself or if it will stress you in any way if you don't.  Hope this helps and good luck to you :-) W  Wickedfairy @kyliemartindale  I'm 35 and that is the question I was just asking myself only a few minutes ago. I am pregnant with triplets which is high risk in itself. Would I terminate if it was a positive... no way so really I look at it this way... I have been blessed with three healthy children this far. I am now pregnant with triplets when we were only trying for one. If by chance one or all of these babies end up having a chromisonal abnormality such as down sydrome then that is what I am supposed to be faced with. I choose not to risk my babies for the sake of knowing now instead of later. There are two types of tests now from what I hear, one is more accurate then the other but has a higher risk of causing miscarriage. I was offered these tests with my last baby even though I was only 31 and said no then. Personally, as it was said in other replies, if you would not terminate even if you were 100% sure of a positive... don't put yourself or your babies through it. That's my feelings anyway. m  mamalaru @kyliemartindale  I have declined testing for my first pregnancy (singleton), as well as this, twin pregnancy. I'm 28, so they never asked me to do an amino (I was 26 the first time around). They said the test consists of a finger *** and an ultrasound to measure the fat pad behind the babies' necks. I was met with some resistance the first time I said 'no,' but stood my ground. I have a healthy 18m DS. I was never told about inaccuracy until they asked me about testing for this pregnancy. They said with twins the risk of misdiagnosis isabout 12%. A friend of mine, also a nicu nurse, was told her twin girls each had tumors on their brains. She was misdiagnosed, they were born completely healthy. I also suffer from anxiety, so wondering about that misdiagnosis percentile and what happened to my friend would drive me nuts. If you think about it, the percentage for misdiagnosis is not much different than you're odds of getting pregnant with twins. I'm not advocating against testing, it's just not for me. I think you're age plays a deciding factor too. I know of a woman (late 30's) who tragically lost her son to trisomy 18 recently. The brain and organs don't synch up with each other, and the baby experiences unimaginable pain. Often, these infants only live a matter of hours. Her priest absolved her to get an abortion, but she couldn't do it. She has 5 other kids. They lost him shortly after birth and are all having an extremely difficult time. My point in mentioning this is that you have to be okay with anything that can go wrong, it's not just downs. Here's wishing everyone healthy pregnancies and healthy babies! l  lovelitto @kyliemartindale  We just got our blood results, 1:190 (cutoff was 1:200) one or both our twin will have downs syndrome. I have 3 healthy kids, 13,12 & 2 & will not terminate but really wish would of declined the test . R  RashandaK @kyliemartindale  I'm also due in October; I'm 15 weeks.  My husband and I opted for the blood test and ultrasound.  Like others have said, we wanted to be prepared if either baby tested positive for a chromosome abnormality. For no reason would we choose to terminate. I did not have the amniocentesis. The risk, especially in a twin pregnancy, of miscarrying one or both babies was too high. j  jeeperwife @kyliemartindale  With my twin girls, we chose not to do any of the tests. We wouldn't change anything regardless of the results. We did end up seeing a maternal-fetal doctor when we were 18 weeks along. good luck to you!! R  RJM2011 @lovelitto  A friend of mine tested high & had a healthy baby boy. Tests are not always correct. d  deanie78 We choose not to, we did the scan first to check the NF and noses. There were no markers so we decided not too. I would have never done an amniocentesis if we had gotten concerning numbers from the blood test. So after weighing the options and risks, it was a no.

The 2 other chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 13 and 18 I think) are fatal and if the babies make it to term they do not live long and are very sick. They drew another blood test today called NIPS I think that tests the placental DNA to narrow down what is exactly going on with them. The first test they said has an 83-87% accuracy rate. The test they drew today has an accuracy rate in the high 90's but it takes 14 days to come back. I'm so scared. I can't stop my anxiety. I don't know how I will go to work.

Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  12 Posts k  kittypaws428 Forgot to add baby A has increased nuchal measurement of 3.2. Reply  Close h  hrparker29 This is a very stressful situation. My advice is to stay strong and pray everyday but try to not let it run your life. I know that's hard to do. My story is happy and sad. The summer of 2014 I found out I was pregnant with triplets (mono/di twins and a singleton). At the NT scan they discovered that baby C, my singleton had a high normal nuchal measurement. At 15w5d my mfm Doctor discovered that she also had an umbilical hernia that was small. I was given the choice of coming back the next day or two days later for an amniocentesis. I was basically told that I had to have it. So on the Friday I had the amnio and 3 days later the preliminary results confirmed our worst nightmare. She had trisomy 13. It was extremely heart breaking but the good news was her identical sisters were perfectly healthy. At that point, while praying daily that they were wrong, we began our focus to get as far along as possible for the best survival rates of our twins. At 31w5d I heard 3 strong and very close heartbeats. Then 2 days later the mfm Doctor told us the horrible news that she was gone. We cried for awhile then went back to focusing on the twins survival. I was only allowed to carry 2 more weeks so at 34w0d we endoured the best and worst day of our lives. Our twins spent 3 1/2 weeks in the nicu for sleep apnea and feeding but they were healthy. I know my story is very sad but it's also very happy at the same time. So my best advice is to pray everyday, keep the faith, and focus on the good while taking in every single movement and get as many ultrasound pictures as you can. One thing I wish I had known about was a place where you can get a recording of the heartbeats so you will always have it. Good luck on this incredibly hard journey. I pray that they are wrong. Reply  Close y  yevij I'm so sorry you are having to worry about this. I have no experience with this I just want you to know your family will be in my prayers and hopefully my comment will keep your post at the top and someone with good advice will see it. Reply  Close e  ereider I'm so sorry for the stress you are under. My SIL was told based on scans and blood tests her son had trisomy 18. The doctors pressured her to terminate the pregnancy but gave her the option to wait and do an amnio (she was on the cusp and if she chose to wait she would be past legal termination time frame). She chose to wait, and the amnio came back that her son had Down syndrome. He is now 9 months old, happy and thriving. He is the light of her life. My o/di twins also were born with a fatal genetic disorder and lived 7 and 8 months, but those months were the best and happiest of my life. From one SN mama to another (potential) SN mama, it will be ok. Regardless of the outcome. I will be praying for you. Reply  Close M  MNmomof2 How many weeks are you Hun? This sounds like the nightmare we went through when we found out at 16 weeks that both our mono/di boys had short (hypoplastic) nasal bones, a hard marker for Down's syndrome. We opted the Friday of that US finding to have the NIPT Verifi test drawn. By Wednesday the following week we were dying inside over the findings and not dealing with it well at all - we knew if one of them had something wrong, they both did. We called our MFM the same day and they allowed us to go in for amniocentesis. We had to know. We already have a large family with four children, and we knew we couldn't endure an entire pregnancy that might end up in a loss at the end. Our initial amnio results came back a little less than 24 hours later and were normal. The day after our NIPT test results came back positive for trisomy 13!! How?! We were frustrated, upset, confused. We were told it was very likely unrelated to a chromosomal issue with our babies in light of the normal prelim amnio results, but to wait for final amnio results. 8 days later our final amnio results came back with normal, male 46XY karyotypes. Our baby boys were chromosomally normal! This pregnancy hasn't come without its ups and downs, all the extra TTTS monitoring, and our baby B had a hypocoiled umbilical cord now. But I'm 22 weeks currently and things are looking fine. I guess I hope my response gives you a little hope. You're not alone and these kind of findings are extremely stressful and scary. Reply  Close k  kittypaws428 Thank you all for your encouragement. I am 11 weeks 5 days. I feel numb. Reply  Close b  bigfamilytree I don't really have any good advice for you. I'm so sorry you are having to go through this and I'm praying that everything will be just fine. I will tell you that when I was pregnant with the twins, my MFM doc asked me at the first appt to make a hard decision. He said "there are so many things that can go wrong, so many problems we may find. I want you to decide right now, if you found out that one or both of the babies would be handicapped, would you have an abortion?" I instantly said no. Didn't even have to think about it. Then he asked "what if they would only live a short life?" I said I would still have them and love them. He said, ok, you can always change your mind later, but just remember how you feel right now in case something comes up. Luckily, for us, nothing did. My point in all of this is, without the stress of actually dealing with a problem, I had no doubt that I loved the babies and would endure whatever I needed to. It's not that simple in life, but I had some comfort knowing that it was in God's hands. My job was to carry them, love them, and trust that everything would happen as it was intended to. Best of luck to you. Reply  Close l  laboome I don't have any good advice. However, if I were in your situation, I would probably opt for an amnio. Reply  Close M  Mbaldwin1013 My husband and I did IVF and we did genetic testing on the embryos prior to implanting them, so wr knew there were no genetic abnormalities. For some reason i let my OB talk me into doung that 1st trimester screening and it came back that my twins haf a 1/13 chance if Trisomy 13 or 18. We know thats not true bc of the previous testing so there are a lot of false positives. I have now decided no more bloodwork bc it just causes so much extra stress. But if this NIPT comes back high risk, i would probably ask for an amnio. I would also consult with a genetics counselor, im surprised your OB wouldnt have recommended that when your results came back high risk. I met with one and they were able to shed some light on how these these tests determine risk and that basically an amnio is the only actual diagnostic test, everything else is just a screening test. Theres also anothet diagnostic test called a CVS chorionic villus sampling that can be done in the first trimester that i would ask about. I will keep my fingets crossed for you! Reply  Close j  jojoe82 Praying for you & family Reply  Close k  kara1031 I'm not sure about each specific test seeing as it was a few years ago and I would have to ask her again to make sure, but my aunt had Mo/Di twin boys. At the 12 ultrasound and the blood test where they test for genetic abnormalities, the dr told her that her boys had a very good chance of having Down syndrome of one of the other genetic problems you mentioned and offered the amnio. But her and her husband chose not to have it. She was 35 and these were her first babies so she knew with the fact that she was older when she had them that there was more of a chance already for Down Syndrome and they had already chose to keep the babies no matter what. Turns out, she delivered two perfectly healthy identical boys that are thriving now and so extremely smart. I am in no way saying that you shouldn't have additional tests done, because if it were me, I think I would want to know. But I admired the faith she had and how she chose to accept whatever circumstances came with carrying the boys to term and thankfully it had a wonderful outcome. I know this situation has to be so hard on you all and I cannot imagine the stress you must be feeling. Keep your head up, Momma and try to stay as strong as you can during this difficult time. I'll be praying for you and your family and hopefully for a good outcome and healthy babies!

Take a deep breath, your baby is going to be just fine. And is obviously going to have a mommie that loves them very much. Congratulations!!!!!! T  Traci2040 @092007gl  Someone told me once to concentrate on all the wonderful things that could happen. I know it's easy to say, but you could worry and upset yourself with how everything could go wrong or you could make a list of all the wonderful possibilities that could happen. You can certaintly choose which to focus on. g  gardengirl2011 @Traci2040  I have to agree with Traci2040 there is alot of fear mongering that is forced upon pregnant women. Know that 'we' have been doing this a longtime and the best thing 'we' can do is help ourselves rather than increase our already heightened fears. If that isn't enough my aunt successfully made carried and delivered two healthy twin boys at 39. Boys were conceived naturally and are happy healthy kids. H&H nine months. h  heather1270 I had to stop doing Internet research - so full of doom and gloom! D  Dee2203 @092007gl  This is an article I found on March of Dimes. Hopefully, this helps calm  your nerves. An abnormal screening test result simply means that additional testing is recommended. Out of every 100 women who take a screening test, about 5 (5 percent) have an abnormal result. However, only about 4 to 5 percent of women whose test results show an increased risk for Down syndrome actually have a baby with Down syndrome (8). Similarly, only a small number of women whose test results show an increased risk for spina bifida and related birth defects actually have an affected baby. For many women, an abnormal result on the second-trimester screening test indicates that the fetus is either a few weeks older or younger than the woman and her provider thought. This can account for an abnormal result because AFP varies, depending on a womanâ€™s stage of pregnancy. An ultrasound can usually show the correct gestational age of the fetus. Another common cause of an abnormal second-trimester test result is a multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.). N  NYCmumtobe Your actual odds are fairly low but if you're worried and need to know for sure, do cvs testing in the first trimester. I'm 37 and did the amnio. Yes, doctors scare the hell out of you but the reality is, our eggs aren't the freshest either. B  Bullmastiff (lol...egg recall) I did the amnio too. My husband and i needed to know. This wasn't a "planned pregnancy" (I was on bc for 9 years!) I'm 34, he's 40 so odds were in my favor, but I skipped the blood tests (too many false positives) B  Bullmastiff (post was cut) I went directly with the amnio. Good luck with whatever u decide! N  NYCmumtobe @Bullmastiff  Egg recall, indeed!!! But I do think ours are slightly healthier (I HOPE) then the garbage coming out of the industrial egg factories in Iowa. I  Imamaniwanttobeprego @NYCmumtobe  Mkur so I be thinking that if this baby be coming out of yo vagina, it's gonna be messed up anyways... Mkur? W  WaterBaby3111 @092007gl  I'm 37 and At my first appointment, my Dr told me I had a 1 out of 250 chance my baby would be Downs. This really worried my husband, but reminded him that we had a 249 chance out of 250 that the baby was healthy! Remember you can read and read and freak your self out - this should be a time we enjoy and cherish! All good things! t  toonces93 @WaterBaby3111  Ditto what waterbaby said.  Seriously, even with odds increasing as we age (I am 42), they are still way in our favor.  Keep that in mind and you will sleep much better. p  pm0fTwinb0ys @092007gl   hey hun. i read a lot of these posts and no one seems to really know what it is like to have a child with down syndrome. Although the risks do go up with your age, young moms, like myself, still have that same risk. I was 18 when I had my twin boys. One was the typical healthy baby boy. The other, has a heart defect and Down Syndrome. Honestly, it was a gift. Any mom in the same situation that I'm in will say the same thing. Down Syndrome shouldn't be a diagnoisis to be afraid of. They are sooo loving and precious people. THey do have a lot of health issues, some more then others, but some "normal" babies have worse. Having a child with terminal cancer is way harder then having a child with Down Syndrome. To those moms, i give them praise and prayers to stay strong. No matter the age of the mom, first pregnancy or fourth, it doesn't matter. There will always be risks for anything to happen during a pregnancy. Even if you do everything right. I took prenatal vitamins, ate healthy, stayed away from drugs and alcohol, i excercised for what i could, drank tons of water; I still had a child with Down Syndrome. It is scary, but once you see your child, birth defect or no birth defect, you will fall in love instantly and no matter the "problems" they have, it is your child and that is all that matters. It's hard to have a special needs child, it was a huge rollar coaster the first year with lots of nights crying. but staying positive and having people who supported me and talking to other moms was a huge help!! I wish you the best of luck though with whatever the outcome. But just remember, no matter what, this is your baby, a gift, an innocent life you brought into this world. And just love him or her.  S  Sara1972 @092007gl  Hi there, I'm 38 and this is my first pregnancy too. I had the NT screening done this morning and was told that the chances of this child having Down's Syndrome are 1 in 783 and the chances of Trisomy 18 are 1 in 25000.  It gave me peace of mind and the screening was non-invasive. We most likely will not go ahead with the amnio, but I suppose that we should wait to get the bloodwork back before we make a final decision. Are you considering the screenng? Sara p  portlandsmith @092007gl   If the Downâ€™s â€œtalkâ€ freaked you out, be well prepared for the first trimester screenings. Â The starting odds are not that great (my lab used 1:50 for 38 yr olds â€“ very stringent), and anything that comes back out of the norm will make your odds even worse. Â It is nice to get peace of mind from the screenings if they come back perfect, but you may want to prepare yourself in case they donâ€™t (lots of false positives). Â Â I know some women decide to skip the screenings and go right for the cvs or amnio just to avoid all of the anxiety and worry. Â Youâ€™ll have to do whatâ€™s right for you, but just wanted to give you a heads up that the risk odds are not always reassuring and there is a time gap between when you receive those results and when you can have an amnio.  N  NewAlbanyMom They like to scare you don't they? I had my 1st at 37 & my 2nd at 40. My tests came back with a downs risk equivalent to a 20 yr old both times. Don't let them take away your excitement for baby. Welcome to a lifetime of worry : ) t  tenkdz I have had five babies between the ages of 30 and 41. I did no testing and all were perfect!!!

I was talked out of the screenings by my OB as they are highly inconclusive anyway... and especially so with multiples as the results are compared to averages (and its hard to compare those averages to twin results etc). I figured I wouldn't do anything (terminate) anyway if I found something wrong...... and I could find out so much that was more accurate at the anatomy scan at 20 weeks..... not to mention the next step after the screenings if it comes back unfavorably is the amnio which I DEFINITELY was not going to do anyway..... double the rate/risk of miscarriage due to having to do multiple pokes vs just one. s  sunshine1976 @MacnOz  Did your level II utrasound at 20 weeks come back normal? We had one today and the twin girl had 2 bright spots one on her heart and the other on her bowl. The boy had one on his bowl. I'm really scared that this isn't good? Would you consider doing anything with these results? Thank you!!! i  ivymountainash @sunshine1976  We never did the down's syndrome testing, but during one of the ultrasounds they found two soft markers(bright spots) on Ava(baby b) and one on Mahdi(baby a). Ava's were in her brain and heart. Mahdi's was just in her brain. They had us speak to a genetic counselor. She said the ones in the brain were fairly common and they would probably disappear over the coarse of the pregnancy, which they did. She said since Ava had two though she was at a slightly higher increased rate for downs and similar birth defects. She said even with those markers considering our family history and such there was less than a 1% chance of her having any birth defects. She talked bout doing an amnio, and about selective reduction. To which I said those are not options for me. Well, both my girls were born just fine and they are almost 6 months old now, they are hitting their milestones just fine and there seems to be no signs or indications that there is anything wrong with them. Actually Ava has been a little ahead of Mahdi on some stuff. (Also, that's how Ava got her name, because it means "bearer of good news" and also "life". So, when the soft markers showed up I knew it was right for her. :) Sorry this was so long. Just wanted to let you know that I had some kind of negative results and everything turned out fine. Did they have you talk with anyone special about it, like a genetic counselor or anything? M  Marleigh2009 @sunshine1976  The only test we did was the Nuchal Translucency screening test.  It was no big deal.  I think for me it was just needing to know so I could be prepared in case.  I wouldn't have done anything differently, but just get prepared. Good luck! M  MacnOz @sunshine1976  I never got anything back concerning... but was it something you saw, the tecnician pointed out... or something your OB talked with you about?  Cuz until you talk with your OB I wouldn't worry.  I think sometimes even ultrasound techs overspeak their bounds (they aren't supposed to say anything) and freak us out.  But I know a lot of instances where something is found at an early ultrasound that is nothing... just something to check again for next time. s  sunshine1976 @ivymountainash  Thank you so much for the information. It has been extremely helpful. Everything I read online tells me that there is like a 99% chance that everything is okay. I even talked to my friend who is an OBGYN who verified this statistic. It's just all so scary. We tried forever to get pregnant and had luck with our first IUI so needless to say it was so unpleasant to hear this news at our last doctor visit. We both tested normal for Karyotyping pre-pregnancy so I am hoping that's good news too. I ended up doing the AFP but I hear those results are inconclusive too and can lead to false positives. Why do they even offer these tests if they aren't really doing us any good?? I have been so stressed the last couple days. It's awful. I am just going to have faith in God and know that we are that 99% percent. THANK YOU AGAIN. Your daughter are beautiful and I'm glad they are healthy. s  sunshine1976 @Marleigh2009  She looked at that in the level II ultrasound and said it was perfect. Same with their overall development and no birth defects. I'm just going to bank on the 1% and not make this a big deal. When did you end up delivering the babies? How far along? Thank you so much. :) K  KyLoMa @sunshine1976  I didnt do any of those tests with either of my pregnancies..I had heard numerous stories of people getting false results...and just being scared and worry themselves to death, just to find out everything was fine. My good friend had hers come back positive for down syndrome, so her OB sent her for an amnio, and it came back that everything was fine. SHE WAS A WRECK. So she opted out of doing the tests for her twins pregnancy. All I had done was the regular ultrasounds, and my ob never tried to push it..she even said there is higher risk for false results with twins. What ever you decide...or find out, I wish you luck!! i  ivymountainash @sunshine1976  Thank you. I know, my OB actually didn't do any of the tests because they are so inaccurate for twin pregnancies. I only had ultrasounds. I know how scary it is. When they told me I was to speak with a genetic counselor I was like "OMG! What is wrong with my babies!?" Try not to stress out too much. I am sure that everything will be fine.

My doctor called me directly and said my quad screen came back positive for down syndrome, and I do see there are some false positives and I was wondering how often this is. Could my levels just be higher because I am carrying twins, and my doctor is not putting the two together? I already have an appointment with my specialist on Friday, and she said they would do further testing there. I know a more in depth ultrasound is one thing that will happen, but what else should I prepare for. Is there a chance I am panicking for nothing? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  14 Posts r  riogirltwins @Molly23  The fact that you are carrying twins could definitely influence the results of the quad screen. Also, please remember that it this is a screening test, not a diagnostic test. Along with the results of blood levels for 4 components (hCG, inhibin-A, estriol and AFP), some of which can be elevated in your case of multiples, screening methods take into account age and calculate probabilities. They can only determine the chances you are carrying a fetus that has a trisomy disorder. A "positive" test simply indicates an increased risk, not anything definite. Please try to relax until someone can tell you something definite. I know that is difficult. Further testing may indicate an amnio to rule out Down's, that is actually diagnostic and can give you a definitive answer. The issue with an amnio, if your twins are in two sacs, they will have to do it twice. I hope this helps. M  Molly23 @riogirltwins  Is it the AFP in your blood that test for the down syndrome? My twins are in separate sacs so would they at least do them on the same day? What is the risk with an amino? Thanks so much for your advise and I will try not to worry. T  TSJ2006 @Molly23  I actually opted not to have these tests done because I had read that they are not accurate in multiples and there is a high rate of false positives. I hope everything works out. I am a worrier b7y nature so I figured I would worry less by avoiding the tests. m  mich1818 @Molly23  My doctor didn't even do this test because he said twins will always get a positive result. Even if it is NOT actually the case. I had an amnio done for other reasons so that is why he opted not to do this test. The ultrasound is also no guarantee of anything. The only way to know for sure is an amnio. If your families don have any history of downs you shouldnt worry. T  Tarabell15 @Molly23  Yup, my Dr advised against testing for that very reason. He said that 90% of the results come back positve and there was no point in stressing about it, when it was likely not even true. He offered to do the level 2 ultra sound if I really needed to be sure, but since it wouldn't change our outcome at all we opted not to do that either. Good luck and try not to stress until you talk to your specialist. Tara M  Molly23 Well I called the nurse where my specialist yesterday to see what kind of testing they have in store for me. She said the quad screen is not very reliable and that is why they do a sequential screen along with the NT scan. So I am going in this morning and giving blood for the sequential, so they will have it back by Friday when I do my ultrasound. She said I should wait on the amino until I have the results of the test, since I would have to do two. Now I wish I never did the quad screen and someone just advised me against it, since I am having twins. I guess I will have to worry till Friday or past that. a  adriennelynne @Molly23  Everyone is totally right about the high rate of false positive. I didn't and won't do prenatal testing for this reason. I do have a son with Down syndrome though. He was born 8/14/08. He is the most amazing gift. I adore him with all that I am. He is so beautiful, so happy, so sweet. :) If you do find out one of the twins has DS for sure, or just want someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to write me. :) I know many people know with Down syndrome children (I didn't know one single person when he was born) and you will never meet a mom who regrets keeping her child- you will only find moms completely and totally in love with their babies. I have a couple pictures of Bentley in my profile. And I have a ton of resources if you need. So once again, the chances are soooo slim because that test is really not accurate at all. So I wouldn't worry. But, I am here, if you need me.  M  MacnOz @Molly23  That was exactly the reason that I didn't do any of the screenings... cuz they are diagnostic, only give you the "Chances" sort of data.  And they are incredibly inaccurate for twins.  There is no way (related to your comment about your doctor) for them to interpret them differently for twins - there isn't an alogarithm to cut the numbers in half or anything.  And the next step was to do an amnio and I wasn't willing to do one of those (two pokes - even more risky) ..... so we just didn't do the screenings.  Infact my dr was the one who advised against them. Hope your ultrasound shows that this was a false positive for you. r  riogirltwins @Molly23  All four components were from your blood screen. Please keep in mind that your additional testing is screening, as well. You will not get any definitive answers from it because positives merely indicate an increased probability and increased probability could be as little as 5%. Good luck and try to relax, I know you are worried about your babies. If you do go ahead with an amnio, they will do them at the same appointment. M  Molly23 Yeah I wish I never had the quad screen, but a nurse gave me some paperwork and asked if I wanted it, and thought nothing of it. I am also really nervous about getting an amino, since I would need two. That basically doubles the risk, IMO. I heard there is a 1 in 1000 chance it could end your pregnancy. Have any of you had one? I know one thing they test is AFP. Is that the one that test for down syndrome. I read that is the one that can double because of twins. D  DrLeBucklin @Molly23  Hi Molly! The quad screen is known for being inaccurate in twins. The better test for twins is the NT (nuchal translucency test). Sounds like your doctors know what they're doing. On a personal note, my twins had an abnormal quad screen. Their NT and ultrasound were normal. I had already decided that I didn't care if my babies had Down syndrome, so that made deciding against amniocentesis easy for me. My twins didn't end up having Down syndrome. Take care! And do let us know how your testing goes. M  Molly23 Thanks for all the input, and of course after my doctor's appointment with the specialist I feel 10x better. They did the sequential screen on me which they say is 10x better, and my risk for down syndrome is 1 in 5000. Those are very good odds for me, and there is no reason for us to do an amino. We did find out are having two girls and they could not focus to much on baby B, because she crossed her legs, but we are pretty sure it is a girl. M  MJM2009 @Molly23  my SIL had this test come out posative as well. her babies were perfectly normal Related Articles & Discussions Prenatal Genetic Testing for Twins  Prenatal testing gives you and your doctors information about your health and the health of your babies.

Are You at Risk of Having a Baby With Down Syndrome?  Doctors describe some of the known risk factors for having a child with Down syndrome. By Virginia Sole-Smith  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Leah Warkentin/Design Pics/Corbis  Although researchers have pinpointed how Down syndrome occurs, they still don't know very much about why it happens. This can make it difficult to understand whether you are at risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. "There have been theories about whether it's due to how well the mother metabolizes folate, but there are just as many studies saying no as studies saying yes," explains Kenneth Rosenbaum, M.D., founder of the division of genetics and metabolism and co-director of the Down Syndrome Clinic at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. "For the most part, we simply don't understand this as well as we would like," he says. Down syndrome is a condition that happens when a baby is conceived with a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. In about 3 percent to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome, there are two full 21st chromosomes and a partial extra chromosome 21 stuck to a different chromosome altogether, the result of a process called translocation. Down syndrome occurs all around the world, in people of every race and economic background. And although it is a genetic condition, you most likely will not have any family history. "In most cases, the extra chromosome seems to happen by chance," says Emily Jean Davidson, M.D., clinical director of the Down Syndrome Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Down syndrome can occur at any maternal age, but the possibility increases as a woman gets older. That said, if you have one child with Down syndrome, your chance of having a second child with the condition is about 1 percent for a mother over 40. If your baby has a translocation, physicians will suggest checking both parents' chromosomes to see if the translocation arose in the baby (most commonly the case) or if either parent is a carrier. If so, genetic testing can pinpoint the cause and determine your individual chance of recurrence. But there is one key risk factor for Down syndrome: maternal age. A 25-year-old woman has a 1 in 1,200 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome; by 35, the risk has increased to 1 in 350; by age 40, to 1 in 100; and by 49, it's 1 in 10, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. If you are over 35 and thinking about getting pregnant, you and your partner may want to undergo genetic counseling to more precisely pinpoint your risk. Regardless of your age, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that all pregnant women should be offered prenatal genetic screening for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. During weeks 11 to 14 of your pregnancy, a blood test combined with an ultrasound (which checks the thickness at the back of the fetus's neck, known as its nuchal translucency) can detect Down syndrome in 82 to 87 percent of cases, with minimal risk to you or your baby. If you are over 35 or have other known risk factors, your doctor may also suggest a fetal DNA test (sold commercially as MaterniT21 or Harmony) during the first trimester; it has a 99 percent accuracy rate because it works by sequencing the small pieces of your baby's DNA that circulates in your bloodstream during pregnancy. In your second trimester, another blood test, known as the multiple marker screening, or quad screening (because it checks the level of four different substances in your blood) can detect Down syndrome with 80 percent accuracy. If any of these screening tests raise a red flag, you can have a diagnostic test such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), though these procedures do carry a small risk of miscarriage. Deciding whether to be screened, and which tests to have, is a personal choice: "Some women feel that the more information they have, the better they can prepare themselves, or they may make some tough decisions," says Dr. Davidson, noting that diagnosing Down syndrome in utero does help doctors know to keep close tabs on whether your baby has any potentially life-threatening related issues, such as congenital heart disease. "But some families decline being screened because they feel the information wouldn't change the course of their pregnancy." Keep track of your medical records with this printable list of prenatal tests No matter what your risk, remember that Down syndrome occurs before conception: "Nothing you do during your pregnancy will increase your risk or reverse what has already happened," Dr. Rosenbaum says. "All you can do while pregnant is take the best possible care of yourself and your baby by eating well, taking prenatal vitamins, and following other common sense advice."

  doi:10.3104/dsupdate.207  The likelihood of having non-identical twins runs in families. Women whose mothers, sisters, or aunts have had twins have an increased chance of having
  non-identical twins. The risk also increases with mother's age; a woman who gives birth at 37 is four times more likely to have non-identical twins than
  at age 18. Neither age nor family history seems to affect the incidence of identical twins, which account for about 4 per 1000 births worldwide. These
  figures only apply to spontaneous, or natural births. Assisted reproduction techniques, particularly ovarian stimulation, increase the risk of twins and
  multiple births.  Twins with Down syndrome  Twins or multiple births occur at a rate of about 2% in the population of 15,000 babies with Down syndrome recorded on the UK National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register . A total of 244 twin pairs are recorded (some prenatally
  diagnosed), including 29 pairs (11.8%) where both have Down syndrome. Nine sets of triplets are recorded, each with one affected child. In twin pairs where
  both have Down syndrome they may not be identical (from one egg), as one pair are a boy and a girl. In a small number of cases, the affected pregnancy was
  assisted using hormones.  These figures indicate that, in a group of 1000 babies with Down syndrome, some 14 or 15 babies will be a twin or a triplet, with their other
  twins/triplets unaffected, and 2 or 4 babies will be identical twin pairs, both with Down syndrome.  If we consider all births, we estimate that identical twins with Down syndrome occur at the rate of 1 or 2 in a million pregnancies and non-identical
  twins at the rate of 14/15 in a million. If the likelihood of having a twin or twins with Down syndrome is also linked to a family history of twins, to age
  or to assisted pregnancies, we presume these factors will play a part in increasing the risk for some individuals.   Resources:   National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine

The majority of the twins are going to be fraternal twin’s, which means that there were two eggs that were fertilized. This is different from identical twins, where one egg was able to separate into two eggs in order to become two distinct lives. Fraternal twins can be of either gender and they can be a combination of boys and girls. This is because they originate from separate conceptions.  Statistics About Fraternal Twins Gender  1. People who are a fraternal twin have a one in 17 chance of having twins themselves.  2. The odds of having three sets of twins that are fraternal are one in 500,000.  3. The odds of having one set of identity and one set of fraternal twins is one in 10,000.  4. Once a mother has twins, the chances of having another set of twins quadruples.  5. Fraternal twins occur in one out of every 90 live births.  6. Caucasian Americans have the greatest chances of having fraternal twins the birth rate of 14.5 in every 1000 births.  7. The Chinese have the lowest rates of fraternal twin births, occurring in just one in 250.  8. One out of every 50 people in the United States is a fraternal twin.  9. The most common position for twins during pregnancy is in the vertex position. This occurs in about 50% of pregnancies today.  10. Fraternal twins can be conceived at different times and they can be conceived by different fathers.  11. Up to 2% of the fraternal twins that are born today will actually have different fathers.  12. Fertility treatments are a common cause of having fraternal twins occurring during a pregnancy.  13. Diet, the age of the mother, and even birth-control pills can all influence the chances of having a multiple birth pregnancy. Many of these factors only impact fraternal twinning and not identical twinning.  14. The average length of pregnancy mother that has fraternal twins: 36 weeks.  15. Over 50% of twins are born before the 37th week.  16. About 35% of twins are left-handed. This is more than double the rate of the general population.  17. A woman named Mary Jonas, who died in 1899 had 15 sets of fraternal twins.  18. Rate in the United States over the past three decades: 70%.  19. In 2009, one out of every 30 babies that was born in the US was a twin.  20. About 40% of twins invent their own languages.  21. Research has documented that twin fetuses as early as 14 weeks begin to reach out for each other.  22. By 18 weeks, twins in the womb are in physical contact with each other about 30% of the time.  23. The combined age of the world’s oldest twins: 204.  24. In examining the records of over 59,000 women over 170 years, the University of Utah discovered that moms who have twins tend to live longer than moms you don’t have any.   Gender Chances with Fraternal Twins  The gender chances of a fraternal twin pregnancy are; 25% chance that a mother will have two boys, 25% chance that a mother will have two girls, and 50% chance that a mother will have a boy and a girl. On the other hand, identical twins are always the same gender. Whereas identical twins will be genetically seen, fraternal twins are genetically similar just like any other siblings would be. They share about half of their DNA with each other. That’s because each child receives half of their DNA from mom and half from dad.  What makes fraternal twins a joy to the families that have them is that they may or may not look alike. They might also act similar or act very differently. They can be as different as two siblings can be, but still be twins. They might have different hair colors, different statures, and different personalities. Because they are raised in the same home environment and share the same experiences, most fraternal twins wind up with more similarities overall than differences. This creates a lifelong close connection that other siblings are unable to experience.  By knowing the statistics about the gender of fraternal twins, we can all begin to understand this unique relationship a little bit more.      Chances of Having Multiples  It is true that having twins can be a challenge. There are twice as many mouths to feed. There are double the diapers. Yet there are also double the rewards and that is something that every parent can enjoy.  What is unique about the gender of fraternal twins is that you’ve got equal chances to get the gender combination that you want. You have a one third chance to have two boys, two girls, or one of each. No matter what the gender of the twins might be, there are still individual learning pathways that occur. One twin may be smart and aggressive, while the other twin might be shy and laid-back. That is the joy of parenting twins.  One of the less pleasant experiences of being the mother of a fraternal twins pregnancy is the increased level of morning sickness that occurs. This is most likely due to the increased levels of the hormone hCG because of the second fetus that is present. Having a fraternal twins pregnancy also requires a higher level of weight gain for many women, and by the 30th week, many mothers are already at the full gestation size of a single child pregnancy. This creates numerous challenges in regards to muscle strains, joint aches, and other physical ailments that can be extremely bothersome.  As most mothers will testify, however, having twins is a definite joy. It is not something that they would never trade any experiences are truly unique. There might be a lot of people who come up to the parents of twins to tell them that they have their hands full, but they have their hands full in a very good way.

Identical twins happen by accident. Your being an identical twin will not influence your chances of having twins. Non-identical twins are the result of the release of more than one EGG, so it can only run on the mother's side of the family. If your mother, sister, etc have non-identical twins, your chance is somewhat increased, because you might also be a multi-ovulator. But no, if you are an identical twin, you have the same chance as everyone else of having identical or non-identical twins.

I read that the probablity of twins having twins is the same as the general population.                 somersetmarine    Answered 9/3/07               11 found this helpful     I was just reading about this as this is my fourth pregnancy I&amp;#8217;m 10 weeks and showing much more than I did with my first three. I learned that although twins do run in families identical twins do not necessarily follow the same chances. Identical twins are created by the splitting of one embryo into two where twins are the result of multiple eggs during ovulation. The only &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; way to know is by ultrasound, although your Doctor can get an indication as to weather or not you could be carrying twins by the rate of growth of your uterus and by searching for multiple heartbeats by Doppler. For now breathe and ask your Doctor at your next visit, he or she should be able to tell you if you have merit for your concern by a quick examination.

AFTiggerIntel    Answered 9/19/07               8 found this helpful     Twins run on the female's side, regardless of the type of twin. Identical twins are caused by an embryo splitting and other twins are caused by a release of multiple eggs upon ovulation.                 melgill    Answered 9/2/07               6 found this helpful     For all of you who are mentioning your baby's father and his father and so on and so forth, just an FYI. Twins are made by the female and the female only. It's either cause by the release of two eggs or one egg splitting in two after fertilization.                 Ashley8402    Answered 9/11/07               6 found this helpful     The odds of having twins if you are a fraternal twin is higher than if you are an identical. From twin.com: The chances of having twins that are identical are approximately 1 in 250 or 0.4%. It is unknown as to why a fertilized egg splits to form identical twins. Identical twins do not run in families and there is no way to increase the probability of having them. 
So If you are an identical it was a fluke by your egg and if you are having identicals it would be purley Coincidental.                 JKnigge    Answered 9/14/07               6 found this helpful     I have to disagree with the REAL answer. My great aunts are identical twins. both of them have a set of identical twins. The tendency for eggs to split has to come from somewhere. So it is possible to be having twins. You would be able to ask your doctor to do an ultrasound to find out.

So any differences between twins are due to their environments, not genetics. Recent studies have shown that many environmentally induced differences are reflected in the epigenome. Nature AND Nurture  Chromosome 3 pairs in each set of twins are digitally superimposed. One twin&apos;s epigenetic tags are dyed red and the other twin&apos;s tags are dyed green.
When red and green overlap, that region shows up as yellow. The 50-year old twins have more epigenetic tags in different places than do 3-year-old twins.  The insight we gain from studying twins helps us to better understand how nature and nurture work together. For well over a century, researchers have compared characteristics in twins in an effort to determine the extent to which certain traits are inherited, like eye color, and which traits are learned from the environment, such as language. Typically taking place in the field of Behavioral Genetics, classical twin studies have identified a number of behavioral traits and diseases that are likely to have a genetic component, and others that are more strongly influenced by the environment. Depending on the study and the particular trait of interest, data is collected and compared from identical or fraternal twins who have been raised together or apart. Finding similarities and differences between these sets of twins is the start to determining the degree to which nature and environment play a role in the trait of interest.  Twin studies have identified some traits that have a strong genetic component, including reading disabilities like dyslexia. Other traits, like arthritis, are more likely influenced by the environment. Twin studies uncover genetic and environmental contributions  Twins share the same genes but their environments become more different as they age. This unique aspect of twins makes them an excellent model for understanding how genes and the environment contribute to certain traits, especially complex behaviors and diseases.  For example, when just one twin gets a disease, researchers can look for elements in the twins&apos; environments that are different. Or when both twins get a disease, researchers can look for genetic elements shared among similar twin pairs. These types of data are especially powerful when collected from large numbers of twins. Such studies can help pinpoint the molecular mechanism of a disease and determine the extent of environmental influence, potentially leading to the prevention and treatment of complex diseases. To illustrate, for twins with schizophrenia, 50% identical twins share the disease, while only about 10-15% of fraternal twins do. This difference is evidence for a strong genetic component in susceptibility to schizophrenia. However, the fact that both identical twins in a pair don&apos;t develop the disease 100% of the time indicates that other factors are involved.   Identical twins (left) share all their genes and their home environment. Fraternal twins (right) also share their home environment, but only half of their genes. So a greater similarity between identical twins for a particular trait compared to fraternal twins provides evidence that genetic factors play a role.   Comparing Identical and Fraternal Twins: A higher percentage of disease incidence in both identical twins is the first indication of a genetic component. Percentages lower than 100% in identical twins indicates that DNA alone does not determine susceptibility to disease. References References Wong A.H., Gottesman I., Petronis A.

And if you are having fraternals, your chances essentially double as kproeger points out. In other words, at age 35 your risk is around 1 in 270, but if you have fraternals your risk is more like 1 out of 130. This is why most OBs recommend CVS or amnio testing for fraternal pregnancies even if the mom is younger than 35. www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0815/p825.html .

This was 1st trimester screening, so not totally applicable to you, but my point is that I do think the testing results are thrown off with twins. I wish I would not have stressed so much for those three weeks....I think my twins would be better off to this day if I had not been under that kind of stress. But fortunately both are extremely healthy and right on for development (though size wise they are still on the small side at 11 months in the 5 percentile).

These tests only indicate probabilities and are not diagnostic. Our twins each had a 1:90 chance of DS  (dear son) based on the 2nd trimester ultrasound, so I understand that when you are given increased probabilities it feels like a problem has been identified, but this is not true. It is certainly possible that your results are inaccurate or inflated because you are having multiples, but even if they are accurate, there is a 90% chance that there is no abnormality. If you haven't already, I would recommend that you post this on the Down Syndrome Pregnancy board. They are a great resource regarding these tests.

And I agree with snm317, you have an indicator - but that's all it is.  Does that mean there's a higher chance of Downs? It may, but it's just a chance.  One thing I learned during my pregnancy (where the doctors were giving me dire predictions throughout) is not to worry until there is something to worry about.  Chances of something wrong are just chances - they do not mean that there is something wrong.  We were told that there was something genetically wrong with baby A, when we ruled that out, they said it must be her heart, when we ruled that out, they said it must be TTTS - none of them ever happened.  So, I know it's hard, but try not to worry when there's just an indicator - because it doesnt necessarily mean that something is wrong.

I'm having boy/girl twins, and the boy has Down Syndrome. Right away, the doctor starting talking about selective reduction, and I told him to stop. I guess that's what a lot of his patients go for, but my gut reaction was to keep both babies. Since then, I've done a lot of crying, thinking about how hard life will be and about the little boy I would have had. How different things will be. I'm just about past feeling sorry for myself, and am more focusing on my little boy who will just have more challenges in life. It's still been a very emotional week though, and I'd appreciate any words of support anyone has.

I didn't find out about my daughter having DS  (dear son) until after she was born. In some ways I think that was easier because she was already here to love. There will be moments that might seem hard. You will have another baby the same age that will possibly reach milestones first. However they will learn off each other and be so close I'm sure, which will be so lovely! My daughter is almost 6 months old and the main thing I want to say to you is to reassure you that although this isn't what you planned for your child or for you, but that doesnt mean it will be bad! It is natural to grieve and cry, but try not to stress over things you cannot control, or over the unknown. I feared the worst when bubs was born. But so far she is doing everything a bubba should. She's smiling and cooing and rolling. She is such a joy. Your little boy will be wonderful and both your children will be lucky to have you               Reply            Report this comment       0                     aaguil20    Posted 07/13/2011      i wish so badley to go back and hug that girl in the delievery room crying over her baby girl.

Things will be different, but probobly not as different as you are anticipating. (granted my guy is only 20 months old.) You are giving each of your babies the most amazing gift, a sibling. They will love each other unconditionally. They will still play, still fight, and still get into tons of trouble with eachother. Give yourself some time to comes to terms with the diagnosis, and get to know those babies and form an even stronger bond with them. Everything will be OK, better than ok!

Here is that link: http://downsyndromepregnancy.org/  I hope some of this info helps--one of the ladies on this board said "I never knew I wanted a child with DS  (dear son) until I had one"-- it couldn't be more true.  Also-- how amazing that you are having twins so that they will always have each other-- I think that is just awesome.

I imagine how difficult this is for you right now. We had a postnatal diagnosis so I can't relate directly, but I can say that it will all be so much easier when you have that little boy to snuggle! And I'd say you're doing great, anyway. That's a lot of adjustment to go through in a week. Go easy on yourself--you have time to get used to this. Know that we are here to help.

I am so jealous--always wanted twins! I had a birth diagnosis, but I completely understand your sadness, shock, and fears. We've all been through it. What I was not prepared for was how much I love this little boy....he takes my breath away. I'm only 6mo into this journey, but what an amazing one it's been so far.  I also recommend the book "Roadmap to Holland". I read it a few weeks after the diagnosis. There are some mommas on here with twins, so I am sure you will get lots of input on what life can look like for you and your babies.

Wonderful  I echo the recommendations about the pregnancy book - I can't put a direct link to my blog anymore (bc rules), but if you do want to go there, go to the disability: blogs and books tab on the homepage. LInks galore and some books that helped me (I especially loved Gifts and Expecting Adam).  When I was pregnant (we had an amnio; I knew), I connected with our local Down syndrome Connection. Excellent. I highly recommend that step - they also have books and other resources.  There are other mamas of twins on this board- I hope you can connect with them as well.

My boy/girl twins just turned 1 on June 18th and this has been the most amazing year of my life! It has been a total blur, but a wonderful blur! My daughter Avery was diagnosed at birth with Ds. It is crazy to me that we had over 20 ultrasounds and nothing ever showed up to cause any concern, but I really think it was all just meant to be. I did have an elevated risk in my blood work, but my NT scan was totally normal. All of my ultrasounds were normal as well. We opted not to do the amnio, because my twins were so active. My doctor was very good, but due to their high level of activity, he was very honest and told us that he could not predict how the other twin would move and if he ruptured a sac we would end up losing both babies. Selective reduction was never an option for us and it took me so long to get pregnant that we were not willing to take the risk. We were very fortunate Avery was born with out any major health issues, and I carried she and Jack to 37 weeks 5 days (no bed rest!! woohoo! and worked until the week before they arrived!). I had a c-section due to 2 breech babies, and we were home in 4 days.  We were of course shocked with A's diagnosis at birth, however, we were very quickly told the best gift we could have ever given her was a twin brother. And this has proved to be so true! Their bond is amazing and it really has been this way since day one. Avery is very motivated by Jack and really does want to keep up with him. Of course now that we are at a year and Jack is pretty much walking I do see some delays, but for the most part she has hung right with him and even did some things before he did!! I sometimes get sad when I see how hard she has to work to do some things that come so easy to him, but she just keeps on plugging along.  It is really cute now that he is mobile b/c he always looks back over his shoulder to make sure Avery is following him!  They really do love each other so much! In fact when we cheer him on and say "Go, Jack!" when he walks she gets such a big smile and claps for him. Brings me to tears to watch her excitement for him!  Of course they also have their typical brother and sister moments! He LOVES to pull her glasses off of her face and bows out of her hair. BUT she is a pacifier swiper and will snatch it right out of his mouth and pop it into hers before he can even do anything about it. It makes me laugh to watch them interact.  Things were tricky when I started back to work full time (I am an elem. school counselor), but we made it through the school year. With twins in daycare someone is always sick. I felt like I lived at my pediatricians office some weeks, but we all made it through the first winter. Avery of course has more appts. than Jack, but we make it work. She of course also has PT, OT, Speech, and an Educator, but for the most part all of our therapist have worked to incorporate Jack into her therapy whenever possible. We just redid her IFSP plan with our EI team and things are going to get a little hectic, but I think we can make it work. As a Mom I sometimes worry I am not getting enough 1 on 1 time with each of them... especially Jack, but they both seem happy at this point.  The thing with twins is if these are your first children you don't know any different! Our motto is simple.... JUST DO IT! haha! I will not lie there are moments when being a twin Mom and having a child with Ds can be overwhelming, but it has really made me dig down deep and realize that I have "mom strength" that I never knew I had. Just believe in yourself and always trust your instincts. I often find myself saying the Serenity Prayer and it always seems to calm me when I am losing my balance.  Feel free to touch base with me anytime regarding my experience with twins and Ds. I never walked down your path of having the prenatal diagnosis, but I can relate to the twin thing and Ds in general. I can give you feedback on the twin gear and what I have found helpful.  Hang in there! Take care of yourself and those awsome little twins. Get rest now, because when they arrive be ready to hold on tight for a wonderful and amazing adventure!!!! Just wait until you see the bond they have.... pure L-O-V-E!!!! Hope you find some peace in this stressful time.               Reply            Report this comment        1               / 3      first page  |  last page                This thread is napping.

Both my husband and I were very worried and I could not get in to see a genetic counselor and get an amnio for one week after my Dr gave me the news.

Do you know how your odds were determined?  Generally there is a formula, where your age, your blood test results, and ultrascreen finding are all combined together to get a "number" which is your odds.  What week are you now?  Was the 1 in 30 from the combination of first trimester blood and early scan, or is the 1 in 30 from a second semester blood screen alone?  Good luck on your testing.  P.S.  Ultrasounds can also pick up anotomical issues that may not be genetically linked.    --  Nancy, mom of 4 girls DownSyndromePregnancy.org : free pregnancy book; free booklet for friends & relatives             Reply            Report this comment       0                     littlemari    Posted 09/29/2009      Just wanted to say Congratulations and thank you for giving me hope that i so need at the moment, i am 39 and my 12 week nuchal scan showed a 1 in 14 chance for genetic abnormality, they didn't give me any blood tests or the usual triple marker test . I went to the hospital where i was booked for an early aminocentisis ( the one where they take a tiny bit of the placenta for testing and you get the results very quickly) but the doctors said the placenta was in a bad position and it was too risky so now i need to wait 2 weeks till there's more aminotic fuild for a normal aminocentisis and so now i face having to wait another month or more before i know and the wait is so long. i'm trying to remain positive but it gets so difficult at times so thankyou for posting this.

I have several friends of a similar age (41) who have had high risk triple test results - one was given a 1 in 10 chance - who have all had negative results from their amnio chromosomal testing.  Its important to remember the triple test is only about 60% accurate in detecting a possible problem. When I met with the genetic councillor she told me my AFP levels looked fine and that my high risk was purely due to my age!!!!

I am 13 weeks pregnant with twins and just got results from my first trimester screening with 1/59 odds of having a downs syndrome baby.  I am 41 which probably factors into the statistics.  The nuchal fold screening seemed good...baby A's measurement was 1.3 and baby B's measurement was 1.4 (both well below the 3.0 threshold).  I am wondering if anyone else had stats like this and went on to have a healthy baby?  I did do a harmony test but will not get those results for a few days and I am totally worried.  Thanks in advance.

It's great that their nuchal fold screening was within the threshold.

I had a 1/78 chance of it until they did the NT scan and then the blood test. After the NT scan the doctor told me that with the thickness being under 3.5 he wasnt concerned at all. But we took the test anyway. The results came back and I was told I have a 1/10,000 chance.   Oh and they were able to tell the gender of my twins since they were girls there was no Y detected                   Status: Offline                   Sep 18th, 2013, 22:07 PM   4       amjon    Other  Active BnB Member        Join Date: Aug 2010  Location: United States  Posts: 7,230        The blood tests are NOT accurate for twins (almost everyone that has them comes back "high risk" and obviously all twins are not high risk).  My MFM did not even order them.  She did the NT only (and the anatomy U/S also after).

I was told my chance of a false positive was as high as 20% by my perinatologist because they consider me 35 already since my 35th b-day is in Nov. 2013.   He even advised against it!  In fact, I know a girl also expecting high risk identicals who was told both babies have it and is struggling to be sure with an amnio needed next, plus a fetal echocardiogram and MRI.  Sounds like a fun pregnancy, right?  What if they don't even have it?  On top of that, she has worries about TTTS, IUGR, and TAPS!  Another real life friend was only 23 and told very high risk for Downs in 2002.  Her nuchal folds were higher than yours, I believe in 2 range.  She worried the whole pregnancy and was offered  termination at every appointment.  Daughter came out perfect and she was very upset with the doctors.  That daughter is now an amazing 11 year old without a single health problem and an A student in the talented and gifted program!!!  Our other question when deciding was what would we do with the info.  We would never abort so didn't feel it needed.  Hope I've explained why I refused the test based on my experience with my real life friend, it's very hard to imagine that you have it.  You also have a VERY high false positive chance compared to her at just 23.

My boys were 1.1 and 1.4 and my chances were 1:3700 and 1:4500  - I was 36 at the time.

Harmony I know hasn’t published enough data medical articles or journals for me to say one way or another as it is pretty hush about its research. They say they have it for twins but they will not provide proof. I requested their stats so I opted for both harmony and maternit21.  Maternit21 however, has published 25 Medical journals on twins and has done 4 studies.  My genetics doctor and myself chose to go with both and compare the results and they both came back with the same thing  Times change so fast within just a year when it comes to the medical field so make sure you do your research and are well informed.

While some parents may feel alone on that journey at first, there are actually many parents and siblings who have shared their stories about having twins or being a twin where one or both have Down syndrome.  Our Resources  See also: Preparing Your Other Children chapter in our book, “Diagnosis to Delivery: A Pregnant Mother’s Guide to Down Syndrome.”  More Articles/Resources  We will start off suggested resources by mentioning Jen Graf Groneberg’s book, Roadmap to Holland . Jen gave birth to twin boys, one with Down syndrome, and wrote of her early experiences.  Another resource is a blog by Eric Waksmunski, dad to twin boys with Down syndrome.  In addition, guest post by Vicki Vila on Amy Julia Becker’s “Thin Places” blog gives a unique and insightful perspective about fraternal twins where one has Down syndrome and the other does not. Vicki Vila’s blog can be found at www.modernmessy.wordpress.com .  Other articles about twins include the following:  Laura’s Love Project (2): Twice the Love  Twins with Down syndrome — our experiences  How often are children with Down syndrome twins? by Sue Buckley  Below are stories from a twin sibling and other parents who have twins where they specifically address common issues, such as birth plan changes, logistics of a twin birth and possible complications, potential differences in parenting that you see, and benefits and challenges of twins.    Parent Stories  Reflections from parents about raising twins when one or both have Down syndrome:  From Meghan who has two identical twin boys with Down syndrome: My name is Meghan and I am the very proud momma to identical twin boys, Casey and Connor, who both have Down syndrome. We did not get a diagnosis prenatally, and I remember so very well the feelings I had when the neonatologist looked at me and said, “We strongly suspect they both have Down syndrome.” I will never forget that feeling as long as I live. It was difficult to breathe, my heart hurt, my very being was crushed. It felt like I needed to be wrapped in bandages to hold together. I was beyond devastated. Quite honestly, I felt like the twins I had imagined and prayed for and loved for 9 months were dead. I mourned “those” twins and realized that I still had “my” twins — I had two very real — completely adorable, absolutely perfect babies that needed me. I took one look at my sons, and I realized with very concrete certainty that it didn’t matter to me if they had 10 heads and neon green skin. They were mine, and I loved them, and I would spend every moment of my life making sure they were happy.  I know this is hard. Actually “hard” is such a crap word for what you might be feeling now. It’s just there is not a better word I am aware of, but I want you to know with 100% certainty — you are so blessed .  There are challenges ahead of you. I know nothing about the double bubble as my guys have no health issues, but I know Down syndrome. I know that for every new skill they will work harder than other kids. But I also know that when they master something new, there is this incredible feeling of wonder that you will experience. I will never forget the first time Connor sat up from a laying position by himself. It was December 4th, 2010, on his first birthday. I had turned my back to finish a sign for the yard, and I turned around and he was sitting up, and he looked so proud. I screamed with joy and startled him so that he fell over. I cried. We hugged. Great day. Casey mastered the same skill 3 days later, and I had the same reaction. My point is — your twins will do everything that other kids do — they will just do it a little slower, and you get to savor it and enjoy it and be thrilled. Sometimes I feel lucky that my boys have Down syndrome. My friends with babies the same age miss out on so much. Their kids just did everything so quickly they never got to enjoy the new stuff. With Casey and Connor I get to watch them learn something, master it, and then move on. When I post it on Facebook, my friends and family share that joy right along with me.  My life is normal. Well, as normal as life can be with twin toddler boys. There are honestly times I don’t even think about the Down syndrome. I spend more time trying to get them to eat something other than graham crackers and goldfish than I do thinking that they are different.  Right now you have a lot to think through. You are facing a future that you are not certain about with medical issues on top of it. I know that you are dealing with a ton. You might cry a million more tears, you might get mad and want to yell, you may be depressed, you may feel like I did and feel like you need to mourn the loss of the girls you have been dreaming about and planning for. (In my dreams I had one football star and one baseball star and they were both going to get full ride scholarships and give me lots of grandbabies — I dream big !) You take this time to feel what you feel. Nothing you feel is wrong. Nothing you think is wrong. Just know that once your twins get here, you will fall in love with them. You will look at their little almond shaped eyes or their little singly creased palms and stare in wonder and think, “How did I get so lucky?” You will realize more joy than you have ever known. Life with extra chromosomes is more beautiful than I would have ever thought and I am a far better person because I got chosen for this journey.  From Bruce who has a girl/boy set of twins where the son has Down syndrome: I have a girl/boy set of twins and my son was diagnosed with Down syndrome. We did not have the amnio, so was unaware. And am glad I opted not to. He is a joy, and they truly compliment each other. It has not been easy, but what total child birth, upbringing, etc. is?  From Darlene who has a fraternal twin sister with Down syndrome:  My sister and I are twins. She was born with Down Syndrome. We are 47 working on 48 in September. Just wanted to reassure you how special it is. She is such a blessing to me. My life is complete with her. I have learned so very much from her, and I thank God everyday for sending her with me. Or – for sending me with her.  From Sharla who has fraternal twin boys, including one with Down syndrome:  I have fraternal twin boys … one with Down syndrome. I had a birth diagnosis. I was really nervous about having twins in the first place (I have two girls too). Then when they told me one of my sons had Down syndrome, I just thought I would never be able to do it. But almost 2 years in, and it works! My son with Down syndrome is the love of my life. He is such an easy going boy. His twin is a fireball, so they compliment each other so well. And they adore each other. I love having twins much to my surprise!  From Terry who has identical twin girls with Down syndrome and heart defects: My identical twin daughters, Susan and Meredith, are turning two today!  We had an amnio after learning that both babies had an AVSD, a congenital heart defect with a strong probability that there was also DS. These are the hard days. Knowing – letting go of that hope that maybe the girls would not also have this – was so hard. Add to that all the prenatal twin stuff and the heart condition.  We didn’t know then how wonderful and amazing our lives would be because of this. What we thought was the loss of our lives as we knew them has instead transformed and changed our lives. I never knew how much otherness was out there, how much love is in this world, how much kindness and compassion and strength exist among my family, my friends, and so many people that I have met through our girls.  Please know that we were there with you at this moment. We chose to continue because we knew that some of the most rewarding expereinces in our lives have been the most challenging ones. Our girls are our proof – what we saw as the toughest challenge is our best reward, only two years in. We have grown and changed and loved so much more. It is my hope for you, too.

Are twins at higher risk of down syndrome??             Molly1090    Posted 15/05/2013       I can't remember if I have posted on here about this before. But it's been really playing on my mind recently! My mw seems very concerned about the risk of down syndrome in this pregnancy, even fast tracking me to see a consultent. I haven't even had my 12 week scan yet!! And she was the 2nd mw to say to me that I need to see a consultent about down syndrome ASAP. Are twins at increased risk or something??

I found out I was having mcda twins on my 12 week scan. I had previosly asked for the test where they measure babies neck. However I was in that much shock I didn't think anything of it when the sonographer said it was difficult to measure because there where two. All I wanted to do was run off and get my head around having twins as I was really upset at the time but as soon as I come out of the scan a mw dragged me in asking about the down syndrome test and did I want it still, if so I was to come back at a week later. She had a leaflet about Down syndrome Dow with twins and was telling me it was more complicated to test twins as the readings can be FALSE or one could have it and one may not?? At the time I just wanted to get out it was all to soon my oh was in the waiting room so I didn't even get to see his reaction to the news. Looking back now I feel like I was rushed into deciding (I chose not to have the test) but im the same as you I keep thinking what if. Hope this helps a little hun xx    --  DD Ruby Born 25/07/07 Weighing 11lb 8oz!! Pregnant With ID Twin Boys!

I went for a second scan yesterday but babies were lying funny so couldn't do it. If it puts your mind at ease at all the sonographer said there was nothing that'd point to there being a problem, its just more difficult to see in twins. I don't think there's an increased risk, maybe they're just keen to take extra care because its twins x    --  Feel so blessed to have 3 beautiful, healthy children: Beautiful boy Liam 24.04.09 Gorgeous twin girls Freya & Niamh 08.11.13             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Molly1090 · Original Poster    Posted 15/05/2013      Yeh I spose if it's more difficult to accurately calculate the risk with two then maybe that's why they are making a big deal of it. I am having the blood test done and scan where they check the fluid behind the neck. But then it sounds like false high risk results are more common with twins, so maybe it would be best not to have the screening test at all? Oooh I wish I knew what to Do!

Downs is chromosomes and is u have none identical twins it was 2 eggs that were fertilised. IFC like me they were identical then it's that one egg spilt. This is how it was explained to me as was told the tests can be very inaccurate with twins due to the higher levels of everything.

I hadn't expected to be offered the blood tests as id read it wasn't accurate with twins. I discussed this with mw. She said that results are accurate but i needed to ask myself how i would deal with wondering if we were high risk. She explained that risks from amnio were greater with twins. So i decided it was best for us not to have the blood part done. Obviously still a worry but try not to think about it too much. At no point has anyone mentioned twins being higher risk for ds  (dear son) :-/ they were happy with my nt measurement and that was that x    --  ME 31 DH 32 DD(2006) DD2(2012) MMC(22/10/12) :( BFP 14/02/13 = TWINS!!

They were basically telling us that we could have the test, but it would only give is a guide to the risk. We were asked how we would feel if the risk was high, seeing as the invasive test to confirm whether one of the babies' had Downs would be risky for both twins. We said we wouldn't have the amnio for that reason. She said, well in that case, do you want to know the risk? If it's a it higher than normal, you will have that hanging over you your entire pregnancy, but you won't be able to confirm either way.  We agreed and therefore didn't have the blood test. xx    --  Non-identical twin girls Rosa and Amelie born on 23 July 2013.

Author information 1 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, and the Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, and the Genetic Disease Screening Program, California Department of Public Health, Richmond, California. Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the observed incidence of Down syndrome in twins compared with that expected based on maternal age-matched singletons, which is the current clinical approach. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of California Prenatal Screening Program participants with expected delivery dates between July 1995 and December 2012. Cases confirmed prenatally or postnatally with a genetic imbalance leading to phenotypic Down syndrome (trisomy 21, mosaic trisomy 21, or translocations) were included. Pregnancies conceived with ovum donation and women older than 45 years were excluded. We compared the observed Down syndrome incidence per pregnancy for twins with expected incidence by extrapolating from singleton data and expected zygosity as is the current clinical approach. This extrapolation assumes that monozygotic pregnancies have equivalent Down syndrome risk per pregnancy relative to maternal age-matched singletons and dizygotic pregnancies have twice the risk of at least one affected fetus. Zygosity for affected cases was presumed to be monozygotic with Down syndrome concordance and dizygotic with Down syndrome discordance. Counts were compared using cumulative Poisson distributions. RESULTS: Of 77,279 twin pregnancies, 182 (0.2%) had at least one fetus with Down syndrome confirmed by karyotype. The ratio of observed-to-expected Down syndrome incidence per pregnancy was 33.6%, 75.2%, and 70.0% for monozygotic, dizygotic, and all twins, respectively (P<.001 for all comparisons). Considering maternal age subgroups and twin zygosity, a significantly lower-than-expected Down syndrome incidence was seen for women aged 25 to 45 years with monozygotic pregnancies and overall for women aged 25 to 45 years with dizygotic pregnancies. CONCLUSION: The observed incidence of Down syndrome in twin pregnancies is lower than expected, most notably for monozygotic pregnancies and with increasing maternal age. Risk-based counseling can strongly affect women's choices regarding testing and management during pregnancy, so an understanding of the true Down syndrome risk in twin gestations is crucial.

Two-year-old Josh McIntosh and twin sister Cara race through the house while their mother Clare, 40, looks on. ‘I seem to spend all my days chasing after these two — but I love it,’ she says. But this picture of a happy family is not something Clare — a former marketing director, who lives with her husband John, 42, a finance manager, and older daughter Amelie, seven — takes for granted. For as she cradled her newborn twins after an exhausting day-long labour, Clare was given the news that every mother dreads: something was amiss with one of her babies.          The McIntosh twins: Josh - who was born with Down's syndrome (right) and his sister Cara (left) ‘I remember looking at the doctor incredulously, thinking: “In my heart, I know everything will be fine.” She said Josh had a single crease across his palm and this was a sign of Down’s syndrome.’ Within four hours, a stunned Clare was told that the diagnosis — caused by an additional chromosome, the building block of DNA — was extremely likely. ‘The doctors talked round the topic and I had to keep saying: “You mean Down’s syndrome, don’t you? That is what we are talking about,” ’ says Clare. ‘Looking down at my two babies dressed in matching white Babygros, they appeared perfect. I struggled to accept that one baby was being described as normal while the other was being labelled as abnormal. I felt hugely protective.

Share this article  Share     ‘Looking at Josh, his tiny life just beginning, as he nestled into me, the whole thing seemed impossible.’ The doctors explained the situation was rare. There are no official statistics on how often one of a set of twins will be Down’s, but on support networks Clare has only come across eight other families like hers. Research published in one medical journal found that in a group of 1,000 babies with Down’s, about 14 or 15 babies will be a twin or triplet, with their other siblings unaffected. It’s a hard enough situation for any mother to come to terms with the fact their child’s life will not be as they had hoped. But how does it feel when one twin will quickly outstrip the other, a reminder of what could have been?          Clare McIntosh — a former marketing director, who lives with her husband John, 42, a finance manager, older daughter Amelie, seven  (left) and the twins Josh (centre) and Cara (right) Clare is not in denial. She knows that while Josh’s quality of life is excellent now, his trajectory will not be as smooth as that of his sister. While the twins are toddlers, the differences between them can be surprisingly subtle, but as they grow up, Clare realises the difference in their development will become more obvious to all, including the twins themselves. ‘As they get older, the gap will increase and it is likely Cara will go to school a year before him, though we hope to keep him in mainstream education,’ she says. ‘But right now, the interaction between Josh and Cara is heart- melting. She sees him as any other playmate — she involves him in all her games and tries to wrestle him. ‘There are also times she tries to mother him. When she is given a sweet, she asks for one for Josh. When we are changing his nappy, she likes to hand us wipes for him. ‘Because he is likely to have delayed speech, we are learning to sign with him and Cara is adopting this enthusiastically. Both children know around 80 signs. When adults talk to our children, Cara will repeat in sign and sound simultaneously to ensure that Josh understands.’ Clare and John have thought further ahead, too. ‘We’ve explored some of the things he will face by talking to other families. Many young people with Down’s have some employment, such as working at a garden centre, and that would be fine. ‘But I’m sad he won’t be able to have children. Down’s causes infertility in men. However, I hope he finds a girlfriend, probably from within the disabled community.’          Clare had not long given birth to her twins when she was given the news that every mother dreads: something was amiss with one of her babies Clare’s attitude hides the fact that the couple struggled at first — her husband John was distraught. She had asked the midwife to take both babies into a side room while she broke the news. ‘In a way, that helped,’ she says. ‘As John came in, he saw the cots were missing and assumed something was seriously wrong with one or both of the babies — perhaps that one of them had died. ‘Telling him that Josh had Down’s was maybe easier as a result. ‘He still says that getting the news was the worst point of his life, even compared with hearing of his mother’s death a few years before.’ Their reaction, says Clare, was due in part to their lack of knowledge about the syndrome — there are only 40,000 people in Britain with Down’s. ‘The less you know about something, the more unnecessarily frightened you are,’ she says. ‘John probably took weeks to accept the news, because we didn’t understand what it meant or what children with Down’s are capable of. I think John thought Josh would be in a wheelchair or that we’d never go on holiday again. ‘He was bonding, but grieving for what we were expecting. We were never angry at our lot, just perplexed. ‘We had a very happy life with Amelie, so John questioned why we had decided to have more children — especially as we had undergone IVF.’ Clare met John in London and after they married in 2006, they immediately started trying for a family.          While the twins are toddlers, the differences between them can be surprisingly subtle, but as they grow up, Clare realises the difference in their development will become more obvious to all, including the twins themselves After four miscarriages, Amelie was conceived just before doctors were due to begin investigations, and was born in 2008. However, Clare was unable to conceive naturally a second time. Medical tests failed to find out why and the couple turned to IVF: first an £8,000 cycle in the UK and then two £2,500 cycles at a clinic called Gennet in Prague, which offered a third cycle for free if the first two failed. ‘Going through IVF was a huge strain. We weren’t eligible for NHS funding because we already had a child. We decided to see how it worked out in Prague and then call it a day if the IVF didn’t work there.’ The sperm and eggs were tested after collection by geneticists and nothing unusual was detected. ‘This isn’t surprising in the case of Down’s,’ says Clare. ‘The mutation seems to happen at the earliest cell division stage of conception, though no one really knows what triggers it.’ After four weeks, the couple were celebrating a positive pregnancy test. At seven weeks, they were merrily coming to terms with the idea of twins. What will surprise many was that Clare sailed through all the prenatal testing and scans, including the nuchal fold test, designed to highlight the prospect of abnormalities, at 12 weeks. ‘The tests analyse risk — they don’t diagnose for certain — but they suggested the chance of either twin having a chromosomal abnormality was very low. For Cara, it was one in 28,000, and for Josh, one in 5,500,’ she says (boys are generally more at risk). Neither the doctors at the Royal Berkshire Hospital or the couple were worried. ‘Almost everyone I knew came back with a risk of less than one in 300 — I knew someone whose risk had been calculated at one in 30 and all had been fine. Our twins’ results were different, but still low risk.’          Clare was scanned at least every four weeks — which is standard for twins in NHS hospitals — and the couple paid for additional tests to reassure themselves Additionally, Clare was scanned at least every four weeks — which is standard for twins in NHS hospitals — and the couple paid for additional tests to reassure themselves. Clare can’t explain why Down’s syndrome wasn’t detected, though she believes that doctors tend to look for problems such as a hole in the heart or bowel deformities, which can be common indicators for the syndrome, and Josh has neither. Has Clare asked herself what she would have done had the 12-week tests come back positive for Down’s? ‘I think we would have carried on,’ she says. When Clare did go into labour at 5.30am in July two years ago, she was premature at 35 weeks. ‘We were unlucky to get to hospital on a busy day, so instead of being taken to theatre and given an epidural with a view to a C-section, I found myself in an ordinary labour room, with just gas and air. Amelie had been relatively easy, so I had gone in very confident. But Josh came out first, and the labour had been slow to progress and very painful. I’ve later learnt this could have been due to his Down’s, as it causes poor muscle tone, so babies struggle to push their way through the birth canal. ‘My body went into shock, so the contractions stopped. Cara wasn’t born for another hour. Then both placentas got stuck, so I was on gas and air for four more hours until I could be taken into theatre so they could be removed surgically.’ A midwife noticed Josh was floppy due to poor muscle tone and left a message for the consultant to check the next day, but — as the first photographs confirm — it was not evident the babies differed from each other. It wasn’t until the next day Down’s was confirmed.          The McIntosh's situation is rare. Research published in one medical journal found that in a group of 1,000 babies with Down’s, about 14 or 15 babies will be a twin or triplet, with their other siblings unaffected ‘Apparently, 20 per cent of babies with Down’s are left in the hospital,’ says Clare, referring to infants abandoned by parents who cannot accept the reality of a diagnosis. ‘But that never crossed our minds. I think it was easier with him being a twin. We got the second child we wanted in Cara — the cake if you like. We consider Josh the cherry on the top.’ The first few weeks were a blur of tests and the couple were grateful to learn Josh was otherwise healthy with no additional birth defects. However, breaking the news to loved ones was less straightforward. ‘My mum said she had an inkling something would go wrong and she feared the worst. I think seeing Down’s like that is a generational attitude, though. ‘She associated it with children being hidden away who didn’t achieve very much. ‘Some of our friends were passing on the news for us, but we had to take control of that as there seemed to be an attitude of sorrow and we didn’t want that. We wanted them to understand about how positive we felt his life could be. ‘So we went on social media and explained that Josh was not ill or suffering — he was a happy and healthy baby. After that, everyone was hugely supportive.’ Another positive Clare took from the diagnosis was how well the health service is set up to support children with Down’s. ‘Because it is picked up so early, therapy begins immediately. Josh had his first physio session before we were discharged.’          Clare said she found it easier to accept her son had Down's as she was a twin: 'We got the second child we wanted in Cara — the cake if you like. We consider Josh the cherry on the top’ Two years later, he gets physical therapy for his muscle tone, but it is his speech that is Clare’s biggest concern. Local NHS provision allows for Josh to attend just three sessions of speech therapy a year, so Clare has set up a scheme with seven other mums called Chattertots, which provides weekly language support. Not everyone is kind. ‘Once someone told me gorillas have the single crease on their palms, too — I didn’t like that,’ says Clare. ‘And at Amelie’s school, some children were asking about my “son who is sick”. So I had to explain what Down’s means.’ Clare admits she worries that if plans for new, improved Down’s testing go ahead on the NHS as looks likely, more babies will be terminated at 12 weeks. She points out that almost all parents of children with Down’s are ‘overwhelmingly happy’ with their children. ‘We really didn’t know what it was two years ago, but our understanding has changed massively. It is a tragedy that people like Josh are being terminated every day, and I worry about the pressure people are put under to make the decision. ‘Being a parent means starting on a path where anything can happen. ‘When you have a baby, they are reliant on you, but there is this gradual sense of letting go. With Josh that process will take longer. ‘Yet, we take comfort in knowing that we will, inevitably, be deeply involved with him all our lives.’ SUPPORT Chattertots: mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/ebdssg          Advertisement    Share or comment on this article                    e-mail          1.9k  shares                   Most watched  News videos           Car smashes into both sides of motorway as driver has a 'seizure'          Shocking video shows BRUTAL street fight between gangs in Catalonia          Shocking moment bullfighter has leg ripped open by a bull          President Trump condemns 'heinous' chemical attack in Syria          FBI raids Trump's attorney Michael Cohen's office and hotel          Trump on FBI raiding Michael Cohen: It's a total witch hunt          Festival-goer's selfie video shows man putting something in drink          Moment floral tributes left for Henry Vincent are torn down          Heart-warming moment stolen French bulldog is reunited with family          Dreadful footage shows moment before dog is cruelly killed by man          Window shatters on a giraffe's head as animal reached for food          Family refuses to comment on Henry Vincent breaking into house                       Three men are charged with gang raping a 22-year-old...

My dr keeps telling me I need to get the down syndrome test..another dr told me the results are not clear with twins. My husband and I know it wouldn't make a difference either way. Is the test worth it? Does it prepare you or just add anxiety? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  14 Posts f  fivetobe @kyliemartindale  If you would terminate if they had downs, I would suggest you go for it. If you would keepThe pregnancy even if you got a 100% positive diagnosis, I'd say skip it. It really has a higher false positive rate with twins, and why cause yourself anxiety?I didn't do any testing. I wouldn't terminate regardless and would rather have a happy pregnancy in which something turns out wrong at the end than worry for 8 months and have it turn out yo be nothing, or even something. But I work in special education, so I have a different perspective than most. D  Divaette @kyliemartindale  I'm having twins and just did the testing yesterday. My goal was to have time to emotionally and financially prepare in case my children have downs. It by no means is based in the desire to terminate...just to have time for research and preparation. d  dipzinskie @kyliemartindale  If it wouldn't make a difference then why test? It wouldn't have mattered to us....we wouldn't have terminated...so why go through the stress and a potentially dangerous test (amniocentesis). z  zyxw @kyliemartindale  Well, it is a two-stage test. The first is blood work and then an ultrasound with an amniocentisis. You can always get the blood work done and then go from there. It really comes down to your reasoning. If you would terminate with a positive, then do it. If you wouldn't, then it depends on whether you want to be prepared beforehand. For me, we would want to know beforehand. We would have wanted to prepare emotionally and financially. I highly advise getting the blood work done and then go from there. At the very least, if you were to find out that one or both of your twins had Downs or any other issue, you would know beforehand.  t  twinsdue8312011 @mcgeelisha  I agree with the pp...it's not just about if you will terminate or not. In addition to being prepared emotionally and financially, your doctors can manage your care and anticipate higher risk situations if you know you may have a baby with some anomaly. For instance, you will receive echos and more intensive cardiac monitoring for a baby with downs syndrome. e  elleira22 @kyliemartindale  I agree with the suggestions given but I didn't choose to do it personally.  I would stick with the bloodwork like they are saying if it doesn't matter to you because the sampling of the fluid is much more risky with twins, the chances of miscarriage double, for obvious reasons.  My doctor strongly cautioned me against it for that reason when I told him that it didn't matter either way to me.  Plus like a pp said, it's not as accurate with twins anyway.  Now that I've said that though, go with your gut and do what will make you feel the most comfortable, escpecially if you want time to prepare yourself or if it will stress you in any way if you don't.  Hope this helps and good luck to you :-) W  Wickedfairy @kyliemartindale  I'm 35 and that is the question I was just asking myself only a few minutes ago. I am pregnant with triplets which is high risk in itself. Would I terminate if it was a positive... no way so really I look at it this way... I have been blessed with three healthy children this far. I am now pregnant with triplets when we were only trying for one. If by chance one or all of these babies end up having a chromisonal abnormality such as down sydrome then that is what I am supposed to be faced with. I choose not to risk my babies for the sake of knowing now instead of later. There are two types of tests now from what I hear, one is more accurate then the other but has a higher risk of causing miscarriage. I was offered these tests with my last baby even though I was only 31 and said no then. Personally, as it was said in other replies, if you would not terminate even if you were 100% sure of a positive... don't put yourself or your babies through it. That's my feelings anyway. m  mamalaru @kyliemartindale  I have declined testing for my first pregnancy (singleton), as well as this, twin pregnancy. I'm 28, so they never asked me to do an amino (I was 26 the first time around). They said the test consists of a finger *** and an ultrasound to measure the fat pad behind the babies' necks. I was met with some resistance the first time I said 'no,' but stood my ground. I have a healthy 18m DS. I was never told about inaccuracy until they asked me about testing for this pregnancy. They said with twins the risk of misdiagnosis isabout 12%. A friend of mine, also a nicu nurse, was told her twin girls each had tumors on their brains. She was misdiagnosed, they were born completely healthy. I also suffer from anxiety, so wondering about that misdiagnosis percentile and what happened to my friend would drive me nuts. If you think about it, the percentage for misdiagnosis is not much different than you're odds of getting pregnant with twins. I'm not advocating against testing, it's just not for me. I think you're age plays a deciding factor too. I know of a woman (late 30's) who tragically lost her son to trisomy 18 recently. The brain and organs don't synch up with each other, and the baby experiences unimaginable pain. Often, these infants only live a matter of hours. Her priest absolved her to get an abortion, but she couldn't do it. She has 5 other kids. They lost him shortly after birth and are all having an extremely difficult time. My point in mentioning this is that you have to be okay with anything that can go wrong, it's not just downs. Here's wishing everyone healthy pregnancies and healthy babies! l  lovelitto @kyliemartindale  We just got our blood results, 1:190 (cutoff was 1:200) one or both our twin will have downs syndrome. I have 3 healthy kids, 13,12 & 2 & will not terminate but really wish would of declined the test . R  RashandaK @kyliemartindale  I'm also due in October; I'm 15 weeks.  My husband and I opted for the blood test and ultrasound.  Like others have said, we wanted to be prepared if either baby tested positive for a chromosome abnormality. For no reason would we choose to terminate. I did not have the amniocentesis. The risk, especially in a twin pregnancy, of miscarrying one or both babies was too high. j  jeeperwife @kyliemartindale  With my twin girls, we chose not to do any of the tests. We wouldn't change anything regardless of the results. We did end up seeing a maternal-fetal doctor when we were 18 weeks along. good luck to you!! R  RJM2011 @lovelitto  A friend of mine tested high & had a healthy baby boy. Tests are not always correct. d  deanie78 We choose not to, we did the scan first to check the NF and noses. There were no markers so we decided not too. I would have never done an amniocentesis if we had gotten concerning numbers from the blood test. So after weighing the options and risks, it was a no.

The 2 other chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 13 and 18 I think) are fatal and if the babies make it to term they do not live long and are very sick. They drew another blood test today called NIPS I think that tests the placental DNA to narrow down what is exactly going on with them. The first test they said has an 83-87% accuracy rate. The test they drew today has an accuracy rate in the high 90's but it takes 14 days to come back. I'm so scared. I can't stop my anxiety. I don't know how I will go to work.

Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  12 Posts k  kittypaws428 Forgot to add baby A has increased nuchal measurement of 3.2. Reply  Close h  hrparker29 This is a very stressful situation. My advice is to stay strong and pray everyday but try to not let it run your life. I know that's hard to do. My story is happy and sad. The summer of 2014 I found out I was pregnant with triplets (mono/di twins and a singleton). At the NT scan they discovered that baby C, my singleton had a high normal nuchal measurement. At 15w5d my mfm Doctor discovered that she also had an umbilical hernia that was small. I was given the choice of coming back the next day or two days later for an amniocentesis. I was basically told that I had to have it. So on the Friday I had the amnio and 3 days later the preliminary results confirmed our worst nightmare. She had trisomy 13. It was extremely heart breaking but the good news was her identical sisters were perfectly healthy. At that point, while praying daily that they were wrong, we began our focus to get as far along as possible for the best survival rates of our twins. At 31w5d I heard 3 strong and very close heartbeats. Then 2 days later the mfm Doctor told us the horrible news that she was gone. We cried for awhile then went back to focusing on the twins survival. I was only allowed to carry 2 more weeks so at 34w0d we endoured the best and worst day of our lives. Our twins spent 3 1/2 weeks in the nicu for sleep apnea and feeding but they were healthy. I know my story is very sad but it's also very happy at the same time. So my best advice is to pray everyday, keep the faith, and focus on the good while taking in every single movement and get as many ultrasound pictures as you can. One thing I wish I had known about was a place where you can get a recording of the heartbeats so you will always have it. Good luck on this incredibly hard journey. I pray that they are wrong. Reply  Close y  yevij I'm so sorry you are having to worry about this. I have no experience with this I just want you to know your family will be in my prayers and hopefully my comment will keep your post at the top and someone with good advice will see it. Reply  Close e  ereider I'm so sorry for the stress you are under. My SIL was told based on scans and blood tests her son had trisomy 18. The doctors pressured her to terminate the pregnancy but gave her the option to wait and do an amnio (she was on the cusp and if she chose to wait she would be past legal termination time frame). She chose to wait, and the amnio came back that her son had Down syndrome. He is now 9 months old, happy and thriving. He is the light of her life. My o/di twins also were born with a fatal genetic disorder and lived 7 and 8 months, but those months were the best and happiest of my life. From one SN mama to another (potential) SN mama, it will be ok. Regardless of the outcome. I will be praying for you. Reply  Close M  MNmomof2 How many weeks are you Hun? This sounds like the nightmare we went through when we found out at 16 weeks that both our mono/di boys had short (hypoplastic) nasal bones, a hard marker for Down's syndrome. We opted the Friday of that US finding to have the NIPT Verifi test drawn. By Wednesday the following week we were dying inside over the findings and not dealing with it well at all - we knew if one of them had something wrong, they both did. We called our MFM the same day and they allowed us to go in for amniocentesis. We had to know. We already have a large family with four children, and we knew we couldn't endure an entire pregnancy that might end up in a loss at the end. Our initial amnio results came back a little less than 24 hours later and were normal. The day after our NIPT test results came back positive for trisomy 13!! How?! We were frustrated, upset, confused. We were told it was very likely unrelated to a chromosomal issue with our babies in light of the normal prelim amnio results, but to wait for final amnio results. 8 days later our final amnio results came back with normal, male 46XY karyotypes. Our baby boys were chromosomally normal! This pregnancy hasn't come without its ups and downs, all the extra TTTS monitoring, and our baby B had a hypocoiled umbilical cord now. But I'm 22 weeks currently and things are looking fine. I guess I hope my response gives you a little hope. You're not alone and these kind of findings are extremely stressful and scary. Reply  Close k  kittypaws428 Thank you all for your encouragement. I am 11 weeks 5 days. I feel numb. Reply  Close b  bigfamilytree I don't really have any good advice for you. I'm so sorry you are having to go through this and I'm praying that everything will be just fine. I will tell you that when I was pregnant with the twins, my MFM doc asked me at the first appt to make a hard decision. He said "there are so many things that can go wrong, so many problems we may find. I want you to decide right now, if you found out that one or both of the babies would be handicapped, would you have an abortion?" I instantly said no. Didn't even have to think about it. Then he asked "what if they would only live a short life?" I said I would still have them and love them. He said, ok, you can always change your mind later, but just remember how you feel right now in case something comes up. Luckily, for us, nothing did. My point in all of this is, without the stress of actually dealing with a problem, I had no doubt that I loved the babies and would endure whatever I needed to. It's not that simple in life, but I had some comfort knowing that it was in God's hands. My job was to carry them, love them, and trust that everything would happen as it was intended to. Best of luck to you. Reply  Close l  laboome I don't have any good advice. However, if I were in your situation, I would probably opt for an amnio. Reply  Close M  Mbaldwin1013 My husband and I did IVF and we did genetic testing on the embryos prior to implanting them, so wr knew there were no genetic abnormalities. For some reason i let my OB talk me into doung that 1st trimester screening and it came back that my twins haf a 1/13 chance if Trisomy 13 or 18. We know thats not true bc of the previous testing so there are a lot of false positives. I have now decided no more bloodwork bc it just causes so much extra stress. But if this NIPT comes back high risk, i would probably ask for an amnio. I would also consult with a genetics counselor, im surprised your OB wouldnt have recommended that when your results came back high risk. I met with one and they were able to shed some light on how these these tests determine risk and that basically an amnio is the only actual diagnostic test, everything else is just a screening test. Theres also anothet diagnostic test called a CVS chorionic villus sampling that can be done in the first trimester that i would ask about. I will keep my fingets crossed for you! Reply  Close j  jojoe82 Praying for you & family Reply  Close k  kara1031 I'm not sure about each specific test seeing as it was a few years ago and I would have to ask her again to make sure, but my aunt had Mo/Di twin boys. At the 12 ultrasound and the blood test where they test for genetic abnormalities, the dr told her that her boys had a very good chance of having Down syndrome of one of the other genetic problems you mentioned and offered the amnio. But her and her husband chose not to have it. She was 35 and these were her first babies so she knew with the fact that she was older when she had them that there was more of a chance already for Down Syndrome and they had already chose to keep the babies no matter what. Turns out, she delivered two perfectly healthy identical boys that are thriving now and so extremely smart. I am in no way saying that you shouldn't have additional tests done, because if it were me, I think I would want to know. But I admired the faith she had and how she chose to accept whatever circumstances came with carrying the boys to term and thankfully it had a wonderful outcome. I know this situation has to be so hard on you all and I cannot imagine the stress you must be feeling. Keep your head up, Momma and try to stay as strong as you can during this difficult time. I'll be praying for you and your family and hopefully for a good outcome and healthy babies!

Take a deep breath, your baby is going to be just fine. And is obviously going to have a mommie that loves them very much. Congratulations!!!!!! T  Traci2040 @092007gl  Someone told me once to concentrate on all the wonderful things that could happen. I know it's easy to say, but you could worry and upset yourself with how everything could go wrong or you could make a list of all the wonderful possibilities that could happen. You can certaintly choose which to focus on. g  gardengirl2011 @Traci2040  I have to agree with Traci2040 there is alot of fear mongering that is forced upon pregnant women. Know that 'we' have been doing this a longtime and the best thing 'we' can do is help ourselves rather than increase our already heightened fears. If that isn't enough my aunt successfully made carried and delivered two healthy twin boys at 39. Boys were conceived naturally and are happy healthy kids. H&H nine months. h  heather1270 I had to stop doing Internet research - so full of doom and gloom! D  Dee2203 @092007gl  This is an article I found on March of Dimes. Hopefully, this helps calm  your nerves. An abnormal screening test result simply means that additional testing is recommended. Out of every 100 women who take a screening test, about 5 (5 percent) have an abnormal result. However, only about 4 to 5 percent of women whose test results show an increased risk for Down syndrome actually have a baby with Down syndrome (8). Similarly, only a small number of women whose test results show an increased risk for spina bifida and related birth defects actually have an affected baby. For many women, an abnormal result on the second-trimester screening test indicates that the fetus is either a few weeks older or younger than the woman and her provider thought. This can account for an abnormal result because AFP varies, depending on a womanâ€™s stage of pregnancy. An ultrasound can usually show the correct gestational age of the fetus. Another common cause of an abnormal second-trimester test result is a multiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc.). N  NYCmumtobe Your actual odds are fairly low but if you're worried and need to know for sure, do cvs testing in the first trimester. I'm 37 and did the amnio. Yes, doctors scare the hell out of you but the reality is, our eggs aren't the freshest either. B  Bullmastiff (lol...egg recall) I did the amnio too. My husband and i needed to know. This wasn't a "planned pregnancy" (I was on bc for 9 years!) I'm 34, he's 40 so odds were in my favor, but I skipped the blood tests (too many false positives) B  Bullmastiff (post was cut) I went directly with the amnio. Good luck with whatever u decide! N  NYCmumtobe @Bullmastiff  Egg recall, indeed!!! But I do think ours are slightly healthier (I HOPE) then the garbage coming out of the industrial egg factories in Iowa. I  Imamaniwanttobeprego @NYCmumtobe  Mkur so I be thinking that if this baby be coming out of yo vagina, it's gonna be messed up anyways... Mkur? W  WaterBaby3111 @092007gl  I'm 37 and At my first appointment, my Dr told me I had a 1 out of 250 chance my baby would be Downs. This really worried my husband, but reminded him that we had a 249 chance out of 250 that the baby was healthy! Remember you can read and read and freak your self out - this should be a time we enjoy and cherish! All good things! t  toonces93 @WaterBaby3111  Ditto what waterbaby said.  Seriously, even with odds increasing as we age (I am 42), they are still way in our favor.  Keep that in mind and you will sleep much better. p  pm0fTwinb0ys @092007gl   hey hun. i read a lot of these posts and no one seems to really know what it is like to have a child with down syndrome. Although the risks do go up with your age, young moms, like myself, still have that same risk. I was 18 when I had my twin boys. One was the typical healthy baby boy. The other, has a heart defect and Down Syndrome. Honestly, it was a gift. Any mom in the same situation that I'm in will say the same thing. Down Syndrome shouldn't be a diagnoisis to be afraid of. They are sooo loving and precious people. THey do have a lot of health issues, some more then others, but some "normal" babies have worse. Having a child with terminal cancer is way harder then having a child with Down Syndrome. To those moms, i give them praise and prayers to stay strong. No matter the age of the mom, first pregnancy or fourth, it doesn't matter. There will always be risks for anything to happen during a pregnancy. Even if you do everything right. I took prenatal vitamins, ate healthy, stayed away from drugs and alcohol, i excercised for what i could, drank tons of water; I still had a child with Down Syndrome. It is scary, but once you see your child, birth defect or no birth defect, you will fall in love instantly and no matter the "problems" they have, it is your child and that is all that matters. It's hard to have a special needs child, it was a huge rollar coaster the first year with lots of nights crying. but staying positive and having people who supported me and talking to other moms was a huge help!! I wish you the best of luck though with whatever the outcome. But just remember, no matter what, this is your baby, a gift, an innocent life you brought into this world. And just love him or her.  S  Sara1972 @092007gl  Hi there, I'm 38 and this is my first pregnancy too. I had the NT screening done this morning and was told that the chances of this child having Down's Syndrome are 1 in 783 and the chances of Trisomy 18 are 1 in 25000.  It gave me peace of mind and the screening was non-invasive. We most likely will not go ahead with the amnio, but I suppose that we should wait to get the bloodwork back before we make a final decision. Are you considering the screenng? Sara p  portlandsmith @092007gl   If the Downâ€™s â€œtalkâ€ freaked you out, be well prepared for the first trimester screenings. Â The starting odds are not that great (my lab used 1:50 for 38 yr olds â€“ very stringent), and anything that comes back out of the norm will make your odds even worse. Â It is nice to get peace of mind from the screenings if they come back perfect, but you may want to prepare yourself in case they donâ€™t (lots of false positives). Â Â I know some women decide to skip the screenings and go right for the cvs or amnio just to avoid all of the anxiety and worry. Â Youâ€™ll have to do whatâ€™s right for you, but just wanted to give you a heads up that the risk odds are not always reassuring and there is a time gap between when you receive those results and when you can have an amnio.  N  NewAlbanyMom They like to scare you don't they? I had my 1st at 37 & my 2nd at 40. My tests came back with a downs risk equivalent to a 20 yr old both times. Don't let them take away your excitement for baby. Welcome to a lifetime of worry : ) t  tenkdz I have had five babies between the ages of 30 and 41. I did no testing and all were perfect!!!

I was talked out of the screenings by my OB as they are highly inconclusive anyway... and especially so with multiples as the results are compared to averages (and its hard to compare those averages to twin results etc). I figured I wouldn't do anything (terminate) anyway if I found something wrong...... and I could find out so much that was more accurate at the anatomy scan at 20 weeks..... not to mention the next step after the screenings if it comes back unfavorably is the amnio which I DEFINITELY was not going to do anyway..... double the rate/risk of miscarriage due to having to do multiple pokes vs just one. s  sunshine1976 @MacnOz  Did your level II utrasound at 20 weeks come back normal? We had one today and the twin girl had 2 bright spots one on her heart and the other on her bowl. The boy had one on his bowl. I'm really scared that this isn't good? Would you consider doing anything with these results? Thank you!!! i  ivymountainash @sunshine1976  We never did the down's syndrome testing, but during one of the ultrasounds they found two soft markers(bright spots) on Ava(baby b) and one on Mahdi(baby a). Ava's were in her brain and heart. Mahdi's was just in her brain. They had us speak to a genetic counselor. She said the ones in the brain were fairly common and they would probably disappear over the coarse of the pregnancy, which they did. She said since Ava had two though she was at a slightly higher increased rate for downs and similar birth defects. She said even with those markers considering our family history and such there was less than a 1% chance of her having any birth defects. She talked bout doing an amnio, and about selective reduction. To which I said those are not options for me. Well, both my girls were born just fine and they are almost 6 months old now, they are hitting their milestones just fine and there seems to be no signs or indications that there is anything wrong with them. Actually Ava has been a little ahead of Mahdi on some stuff. (Also, that's how Ava got her name, because it means "bearer of good news" and also "life". So, when the soft markers showed up I knew it was right for her. :) Sorry this was so long. Just wanted to let you know that I had some kind of negative results and everything turned out fine. Did they have you talk with anyone special about it, like a genetic counselor or anything? M  Marleigh2009 @sunshine1976  The only test we did was the Nuchal Translucency screening test.  It was no big deal.  I think for me it was just needing to know so I could be prepared in case.  I wouldn't have done anything differently, but just get prepared. Good luck! M  MacnOz @sunshine1976  I never got anything back concerning... but was it something you saw, the tecnician pointed out... or something your OB talked with you about?  Cuz until you talk with your OB I wouldn't worry.  I think sometimes even ultrasound techs overspeak their bounds (they aren't supposed to say anything) and freak us out.  But I know a lot of instances where something is found at an early ultrasound that is nothing... just something to check again for next time. s  sunshine1976 @ivymountainash  Thank you so much for the information. It has been extremely helpful. Everything I read online tells me that there is like a 99% chance that everything is okay. I even talked to my friend who is an OBGYN who verified this statistic. It's just all so scary. We tried forever to get pregnant and had luck with our first IUI so needless to say it was so unpleasant to hear this news at our last doctor visit. We both tested normal for Karyotyping pre-pregnancy so I am hoping that's good news too. I ended up doing the AFP but I hear those results are inconclusive too and can lead to false positives. Why do they even offer these tests if they aren't really doing us any good?? I have been so stressed the last couple days. It's awful. I am just going to have faith in God and know that we are that 99% percent. THANK YOU AGAIN. Your daughter are beautiful and I'm glad they are healthy. s  sunshine1976 @Marleigh2009  She looked at that in the level II ultrasound and said it was perfect. Same with their overall development and no birth defects. I'm just going to bank on the 1% and not make this a big deal. When did you end up delivering the babies? How far along? Thank you so much. :) K  KyLoMa @sunshine1976  I didnt do any of those tests with either of my pregnancies..I had heard numerous stories of people getting false results...and just being scared and worry themselves to death, just to find out everything was fine. My good friend had hers come back positive for down syndrome, so her OB sent her for an amnio, and it came back that everything was fine. SHE WAS A WRECK. So she opted out of doing the tests for her twins pregnancy. All I had done was the regular ultrasounds, and my ob never tried to push it..she even said there is higher risk for false results with twins. What ever you decide...or find out, I wish you luck!! i  ivymountainash @sunshine1976  Thank you. I know, my OB actually didn't do any of the tests because they are so inaccurate for twin pregnancies. I only had ultrasounds. I know how scary it is. When they told me I was to speak with a genetic counselor I was like "OMG! What is wrong with my babies!?" Try not to stress out too much. I am sure that everything will be fine.

My doctor called me directly and said my quad screen came back positive for down syndrome, and I do see there are some false positives and I was wondering how often this is. Could my levels just be higher because I am carrying twins, and my doctor is not putting the two together? I already have an appointment with my specialist on Friday, and she said they would do further testing there. I know a more in depth ultrasound is one thing that will happen, but what else should I prepare for. Is there a chance I am panicking for nothing? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  14 Posts r  riogirltwins @Molly23  The fact that you are carrying twins could definitely influence the results of the quad screen. Also, please remember that it this is a screening test, not a diagnostic test. Along with the results of blood levels for 4 components (hCG, inhibin-A, estriol and AFP), some of which can be elevated in your case of multiples, screening methods take into account age and calculate probabilities. They can only determine the chances you are carrying a fetus that has a trisomy disorder. A "positive" test simply indicates an increased risk, not anything definite. Please try to relax until someone can tell you something definite. I know that is difficult. Further testing may indicate an amnio to rule out Down's, that is actually diagnostic and can give you a definitive answer. The issue with an amnio, if your twins are in two sacs, they will have to do it twice. I hope this helps. M  Molly23 @riogirltwins  Is it the AFP in your blood that test for the down syndrome? My twins are in separate sacs so would they at least do them on the same day? What is the risk with an amino? Thanks so much for your advise and I will try not to worry. T  TSJ2006 @Molly23  I actually opted not to have these tests done because I had read that they are not accurate in multiples and there is a high rate of false positives. I hope everything works out. I am a worrier b7y nature so I figured I would worry less by avoiding the tests. m  mich1818 @Molly23  My doctor didn't even do this test because he said twins will always get a positive result. Even if it is NOT actually the case. I had an amnio done for other reasons so that is why he opted not to do this test. The ultrasound is also no guarantee of anything. The only way to know for sure is an amnio. If your families don have any history of downs you shouldnt worry. T  Tarabell15 @Molly23  Yup, my Dr advised against testing for that very reason. He said that 90% of the results come back positve and there was no point in stressing about it, when it was likely not even true. He offered to do the level 2 ultra sound if I really needed to be sure, but since it wouldn't change our outcome at all we opted not to do that either. Good luck and try not to stress until you talk to your specialist. Tara M  Molly23 Well I called the nurse where my specialist yesterday to see what kind of testing they have in store for me. She said the quad screen is not very reliable and that is why they do a sequential screen along with the NT scan. So I am going in this morning and giving blood for the sequential, so they will have it back by Friday when I do my ultrasound. She said I should wait on the amino until I have the results of the test, since I would have to do two. Now I wish I never did the quad screen and someone just advised me against it, since I am having twins. I guess I will have to worry till Friday or past that. a  adriennelynne @Molly23  Everyone is totally right about the high rate of false positive. I didn't and won't do prenatal testing for this reason. I do have a son with Down syndrome though. He was born 8/14/08. He is the most amazing gift. I adore him with all that I am. He is so beautiful, so happy, so sweet. :) If you do find out one of the twins has DS for sure, or just want someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to write me. :) I know many people know with Down syndrome children (I didn't know one single person when he was born) and you will never meet a mom who regrets keeping her child- you will only find moms completely and totally in love with their babies. I have a couple pictures of Bentley in my profile. And I have a ton of resources if you need. So once again, the chances are soooo slim because that test is really not accurate at all. So I wouldn't worry. But, I am here, if you need me.  M  MacnOz @Molly23  That was exactly the reason that I didn't do any of the screenings... cuz they are diagnostic, only give you the "Chances" sort of data.  And they are incredibly inaccurate for twins.  There is no way (related to your comment about your doctor) for them to interpret them differently for twins - there isn't an alogarithm to cut the numbers in half or anything.  And the next step was to do an amnio and I wasn't willing to do one of those (two pokes - even more risky) ..... so we just didn't do the screenings.  Infact my dr was the one who advised against them. Hope your ultrasound shows that this was a false positive for you. r  riogirltwins @Molly23  All four components were from your blood screen. Please keep in mind that your additional testing is screening, as well. You will not get any definitive answers from it because positives merely indicate an increased probability and increased probability could be as little as 5%. Good luck and try to relax, I know you are worried about your babies. If you do go ahead with an amnio, they will do them at the same appointment. M  Molly23 Yeah I wish I never had the quad screen, but a nurse gave me some paperwork and asked if I wanted it, and thought nothing of it. I am also really nervous about getting an amino, since I would need two. That basically doubles the risk, IMO. I heard there is a 1 in 1000 chance it could end your pregnancy. Have any of you had one? I know one thing they test is AFP. Is that the one that test for down syndrome. I read that is the one that can double because of twins. D  DrLeBucklin @Molly23  Hi Molly! The quad screen is known for being inaccurate in twins. The better test for twins is the NT (nuchal translucency test). Sounds like your doctors know what they're doing. On a personal note, my twins had an abnormal quad screen. Their NT and ultrasound were normal. I had already decided that I didn't care if my babies had Down syndrome, so that made deciding against amniocentesis easy for me. My twins didn't end up having Down syndrome. Take care! And do let us know how your testing goes. M  Molly23 Thanks for all the input, and of course after my doctor's appointment with the specialist I feel 10x better. They did the sequential screen on me which they say is 10x better, and my risk for down syndrome is 1 in 5000. Those are very good odds for me, and there is no reason for us to do an amino. We did find out are having two girls and they could not focus to much on baby B, because she crossed her legs, but we are pretty sure it is a girl. M  MJM2009 @Molly23  my SIL had this test come out posative as well. her babies were perfectly normal Related Articles & Discussions Prenatal Genetic Testing for Twins  Prenatal testing gives you and your doctors information about your health and the health of your babies.

Are You at Risk of Having a Baby With Down Syndrome?  Doctors describe some of the known risk factors for having a child with Down syndrome. By Virginia Sole-Smith  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Leah Warkentin/Design Pics/Corbis  Although researchers have pinpointed how Down syndrome occurs, they still don't know very much about why it happens. This can make it difficult to understand whether you are at risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. "There have been theories about whether it's due to how well the mother metabolizes folate, but there are just as many studies saying no as studies saying yes," explains Kenneth Rosenbaum, M.D., founder of the division of genetics and metabolism and co-director of the Down Syndrome Clinic at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. "For the most part, we simply don't understand this as well as we would like," he says. Down syndrome is a condition that happens when a baby is conceived with a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. In about 3 percent to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome, there are two full 21st chromosomes and a partial extra chromosome 21 stuck to a different chromosome altogether, the result of a process called translocation. Down syndrome occurs all around the world, in people of every race and economic background. And although it is a genetic condition, you most likely will not have any family history. "In most cases, the extra chromosome seems to happen by chance," says Emily Jean Davidson, M.D., clinical director of the Down Syndrome Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Down syndrome can occur at any maternal age, but the possibility increases as a woman gets older. That said, if you have one child with Down syndrome, your chance of having a second child with the condition is about 1 percent for a mother over 40. If your baby has a translocation, physicians will suggest checking both parents' chromosomes to see if the translocation arose in the baby (most commonly the case) or if either parent is a carrier. If so, genetic testing can pinpoint the cause and determine your individual chance of recurrence. But there is one key risk factor for Down syndrome: maternal age. A 25-year-old woman has a 1 in 1,200 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome; by 35, the risk has increased to 1 in 350; by age 40, to 1 in 100; and by 49, it's 1 in 10, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. If you are over 35 and thinking about getting pregnant, you and your partner may want to undergo genetic counseling to more precisely pinpoint your risk. Regardless of your age, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that all pregnant women should be offered prenatal genetic screening for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. During weeks 11 to 14 of your pregnancy, a blood test combined with an ultrasound (which checks the thickness at the back of the fetus's neck, known as its nuchal translucency) can detect Down syndrome in 82 to 87 percent of cases, with minimal risk to you or your baby. If you are over 35 or have other known risk factors, your doctor may also suggest a fetal DNA test (sold commercially as MaterniT21 or Harmony) during the first trimester; it has a 99 percent accuracy rate because it works by sequencing the small pieces of your baby's DNA that circulates in your bloodstream during pregnancy. In your second trimester, another blood test, known as the multiple marker screening, or quad screening (because it checks the level of four different substances in your blood) can detect Down syndrome with 80 percent accuracy. If any of these screening tests raise a red flag, you can have a diagnostic test such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), though these procedures do carry a small risk of miscarriage. Deciding whether to be screened, and which tests to have, is a personal choice: "Some women feel that the more information they have, the better they can prepare themselves, or they may make some tough decisions," says Dr. Davidson, noting that diagnosing Down syndrome in utero does help doctors know to keep close tabs on whether your baby has any potentially life-threatening related issues, such as congenital heart disease. "But some families decline being screened because they feel the information wouldn't change the course of their pregnancy." Keep track of your medical records with this printable list of prenatal tests No matter what your risk, remember that Down syndrome occurs before conception: "Nothing you do during your pregnancy will increase your risk or reverse what has already happened," Dr. Rosenbaum says. "All you can do while pregnant is take the best possible care of yourself and your baby by eating well, taking prenatal vitamins, and following other common sense advice."
