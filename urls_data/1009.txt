 Newsletter Survival Rates and Outlook for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Medically reviewed by University of Illinois-Chicago, College of Medicine on  October 31, 2016 — Written by Rachel Nall, RN, BSN, CCRN Survival rates Influencing factors Coping and support What is acute myeloid leukemia?  Acute myeloid leukemia or AML is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood. Another name for it is acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. According to the Cleveland Clinic , AML is the most common acute leukemia type in adults.  AML is a type of leukemia. The term “ leukemia ” refers to cancers of the blood cells and bone marrow. Doctors call AML “acute” because the condition can progress rapidly.  The word myeloid or myelogenous refers to the cell type it affects. Myeloid cells are precursors to other blood cells. Usually these cells go on to develop into red blood cells, platelets, and special types of white cells. But in AML, they aren’t able to develop normally.  When a person has AML, their myeloid cells mutate and form leukemic blasts. These cells don’t function as normal cells do. They can keep the body from making normal, healthy cells. Eventually, a person will start to lack red blood cells that carry oxygen, platelets that prevent easy bleeding, and white blood cells that protect the body from diseases. That’s because their body is too busy making the leukemic blast cells. The result can be deadly.  For many people, AML is a treatable disease. Advancements in cancer treatments and doctors’ understanding of the disease mean that more and more people survive the condition each year.  Survival rates What are the survival rates for acute myeloid leukemia?  Ever year doctors diagnose an estimated 20,000 people in the United States with AML. An estimated 10,000 deaths occur on a yearly basis because of the disease. However, this number is for all people with AML, not just the people diagnosed in a year.  Most people with AML receive chemotherapy treatments. These are medicines that kill rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. In patients younger than 60, roughly 70 to 80 percent will go into remission after “induction” (first round) of chemo. Remission means a person doesn’t have symptoms of the disease and their blood cell counts are in a normal range.  Those older than age 60 don’t typically respond to treatment as well. Patients older than 60 also have a higher rate of dying during treatments. Some people who go into remission stay in remission. Still for many AML can return over time  The five-year overall survival rate for AML is 26 percent . This means that of the thousands of people living with AML, an estimated 26 percent are still living five years after their diagnosis. For lower risk AML groups, the five-year-survival-rate is 65 percent.  AML Classification  Different types of AML exist. Doctors often classify them by their cell mutations. Some cell mutation types are known to be more responsive to treatments. Examples include mutated CEBPA and inv(16) CBFB-MYH11 cells.  Some cell mutations can be very treatment-resistant. Examples include del(5q) and inv(3) RPN1-EVI1. Your oncologist will tell you what type or types of cell mutation you may have.  Influencing factors What factors influence survival rate?  The outlook and prognosis for AML varies widely. Doctors take into account many factors when giving someone a prognosis.  Examples of these factors include:  Age  Age can be a major factor in determining AML treatment response. Doctors know that survival rates for those diagnosed with AML is more promising for people who are under the age of 60.  This could be for a number of reasons. Some people older than the age of 60 may not be in good health. This can make it difficult for their bodies to handle the strong chemotherapy medications and other cancer treatments, associated with AML.  AML type  As mentioned earlier, several AML types exist. They’re based on the kind of leukemic cells present in the blood and bone marrow. Some AML types are associated with a better survival outlook than others. Your doctor should discuss the type of cells and genetic changes these cells have with you.  Response to treatment  Sometimes people respond better to treatments than others. If a person receives chemotherapy treatments and their cancer doesn’t come back within five years, they’re usually considered cured. If a person’s cancer comes back or doesn’t respond to treatments at all, their treatment outcome isn’t as favorable.  A prognosis or survival outlook is based on a number of factors. Much of it is based on the outcomes and analysis of your of blood tests , imaging studies, cerebrospinal fluid examinations , and bone marrow biopsies . Some people with a poor prognosis live many more years than a doctor predicts while others may not live as long.  Coping and support How can a person seek support?  Regardless of prognosis, an AML diagnosis can create emotions of fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. You may be unsure where to turn or seek support. Here are a few tips to help you navigate this diagnosis and treatment.  Ask questions: It’s important that you understand your condition. If there’s something you’re uncertain of regarding your diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis, ask your doctor. Examples of questions to ask could include “What are my treatment options?” and “What can I do to prevent AML from coming back?”  Find organizations that provide support: Organizations such as the American Cancer Society (ACS) and Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) offer a number of supportive services. These include arranging rides to treatment and helping you find assistive personnel, such as dietitians or social workers.  Join a support group: Support groups are an excellent way to meet individuals who are going through similar emotions as you. Seeing the successes and mindsets of others can help you know you aren’t alone. In addition to resources such as the ACS and LLS, your oncologist or local hospital may offer support groups.  Reach out to friends and family: Many friends and family will want to help. Let them deliver meals or simply listen to your concerns. Opening up to others can help you maintain a positive frame of mind.  Find enjoyable ways to relieve stress: There are many outlets for you to relieve stress and concern in your life. Meditation or keeping a journal or blog are a few examples. Plus they cost very little to take on and keep up. Finding an outlet that you especially enjoy can do wonders for your mind and spirit.  A cancer diagnosis isn’t a death sentence. It does present the opportunity for you to grow nearer to those closest to you and evaluate how you can live a life you enjoy.

Leukemia in Children  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Types             Survival Rates for Childhood Leukemias   When discussing cancer survival statistics, doctors often use a number called the 5-year survival rate . This refers to the percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed. With acute leukemias, children who are free of the disease after 5 years are very likely to have been cured, because it’s very rare for these cancers to return after this long.   Survival rates are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of children who had the disease, but they can’t predict what will happen in any child’s case. Knowing the type of leukemia is important in estimating a child’s outlook. But a number of other factors, including the child’s age and leukemia characteristics, can also affect outlook. Many of these factors are discussed in Prognostic Factors In Childhood Leukemia (ALL or AML). Even when taking these other factors into account, survival rates are at best rough estimates. Your child’s doctor is likely to be a good source as to whether these numbers apply to your child, as he or she knows your situation best.  Current 5-year survival rates are based on children first diagnosed and treated more than 5 years ago. Improvements in treatment since then might result in a better outlook for children now being diagnosed.  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)  The 5-year survival rate for children with ALL has greatly increased over time and is now more than 85% overall.  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)  The overall 5-year survival rate for children with AML has also increased over time, and is now in the range of 60% to 70%. However, survival rates vary depending on the subtype of AML and other factors. For example, most studies suggest that the cure rate for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML, is now higher than 80%, but rates are lower for some other subtypes of AML.  Other childhood leukemias  Accurate survival rates for less common forms of childhood leukemia are harder to find.  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML): For JMML, 5-year survival rates of about 50% have been reported.  Chronic leukemias: For chronic leukemias, which are rare in children, 5-year survival rates are less helpful, because some children may live for a long time with the leukemia without actually being cured. In the past, 5-year survival rates for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) were reported to be in the range of 60% to 80%. With newer, more effective medicines developed for CML in recent years, survival rates are likely to be higher now, although these new drugs have not been in use long enough to be sure.

This is most people’s first question, along with “want can I expect to happen.” The doctor’s answer is called a prognosis (an educated guess about the likely course of your disease and how long you might live). Because each person is unique, and each person’s disease is different, a prognosis can be difficult to make. Also, how a disease progresses over time is unpredictable, and less is known about rare diseases than common diseases.  Whether you are an aplastic anemia , MDS or PNH patient, you need to talk to your doctor about your prognosis. This may be hard to hear, but getting a prognosis will give you key information about the treatment decisions you need to make so you can plan for the future.  Prognosis guidelines based on current data  Aplastic Anemia  With standard treatments, about 7 out of 10 aplastic anemia patients get better. Standard treatments include immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with cyclosporine , or a bone marrow transplant . The chance for recovery depends on many factors, including how severe your case is and how you respond to treatment.  MDS  There are many different subtypes of MDS, which are identified by testing the blood and bone marrow. Your MDS subtype is a key factor in a doctor’ decision about your treatment and your prognosis (an educated guess about the likely course of your disease and how long you might live).  To figure out a prognosis for a given patient, doctors also use a prognostic scoring system. The most common one used today is the International Prognostic Scoring System , or IPSS for short. This system looks at three things:   Number of low blood counts you have  Percentage of young white blood cells ( blasts ) in bone marrow cells  Number of cytogenetic changes (abnormal gene changes) in bone marrow cells   This prognostic scoring system tells your doctor how severe your disease is and how likely it is that your MDS might become acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It also gives your doctor a general idea about how long you might live.  With current treatments, patients with lower-risk types of some MDS can live for 5 years or even longer. Patients with higher-risk MDS that becomes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are likely to have a shorter life span. About 30 out of 100 MDS patients will develop AML.  PNH  Many people with PNH live for decades. People with PNH who develop blood clots in key parts of the body or develop MDS ( myelodysplastic syndromes ) or AML (acute myeloid leukemia) may have a shorter life span.  New treatments becoming available for PNH are helping people with PNH to live longer. Older research you may have come across state that PNH patients live an average of 15 to 20 years after diagnosis. More recent research shows how that lifespan has climbed over the past 20 years. It’s possible that PNH patients – who rarely develop MDS or AML – will soon have a lifespan that is normal compared with people their own age.

people are diagnosed with this type of leukemia each year. You will also learn some general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. To see other pages, use the menu.  CLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults. This year, an estimated 20,110 people of all ages (12,310 men and 7,800 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with CLL. CLL is more common in older adults. The average age of people diagnosed with CLL is 71. CLL is rare in children.  It is estimated that 4,660 deaths (2,880 men and 1,780 women) from CLL will occur this year. The survival rate for people with CLL varies widely according to the stage of the disease (see Stages .)  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for people with CLL is 83%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with CLL are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. People should talk with their doctor if they have questions about this information.

Click on the links below to view statistics about each disease:   General Blood Cancers  Leukemia  Lymphoma  Myeloma  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)     General Blood Cancers    New Cases   Approximately every 3 minutes one person in the United States (US) is diagnosed with a blood cancer.  An estimated combined total of 172,910 people in the US are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma in 2017.  New cases of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to account for 10.2 percent of the estimated 1,688,780 new cancer cases diagnosed in the US in 2017.    Prevalence   Prevalence is the estimated number of people alive on a certain date in a population who previously had a diagnosis of the disease. An estimated 1,290,773 people in the US are either living with, or are in remission from, leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma.   Survival   Relative survival compares the survival rate of a person diagnosed with a disease to that of a person without the disease. The most recent survival data available may not fully represent the outcomes of all current therapies and, as a result, may underestimate survival to a small degree.    Deaths   Approximately every 9 minutes, someone in the US dies from a blood cancer. This statistic represents approximately 160 people each day or more than six people every hour.  Leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to cause the deaths of an estimated 58,300 people in the US in 2017.  These diseases are expected to account for 9.7 percent of the deaths from cancer in 2017, based on the estimated total of 600,920 cancer deaths.     Leukemia    New Cases   In 2017, 62,130 people are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia.   Prevalence   There are an estimated 363,794 people living with, or in remission from, leukemia in the US.   Survival   The overall five-year relative survival rate for leukemia has more than quadrupled since 1960. From 1960 to 1963, the five-year relative survival rate among whites (only data available) with leukemia was 14 percent. From 1975 to 1977, the five-year relative survival rate for the total population with leukemia was 34.2 percent, and from 2006 to 2012, the overall relative survival rate was 62.7 percent.  From 2006-2012, the five-year relative survival rates overall were  CML - 65.9 percent  CLL - 85.1 percent  AML - 26.8 percent overall and 66.8 percent for children and adolescents younger than 15 years  ALL - 70.7 percent overall, 92.3 percent for children and adolescents younger than 15 years, and 94.1 percent for children younger than 5 years.     Deaths   In 2017, 24,500 people are expected to die from leukemia (14,300 males and 10,200 females).  In 2009-2013, leukemia was the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths in men and the sixth most common in women.     Hodgkin (HL) and Non-Hodgkin (NHL) Lymphoma    New Cases   In 2017, there are expected to be 80,500 new cases of lymphoma diagnosed in the US (8,260 cases of HL, 72,240 cases of NHL).   Prevalence   In 2017, there are an estimated 816,634 people living with, or in remission from, lymphoma in the US.  There are 186,607 people living with Hodgkin lymphoma  There are 630,027 people living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma     Survival   The 5-year relative survival rate for people with HL has more than doubled, from 40 percent in whites from 1960 to 1963 (only data available) to 88.5 percent for all races from 2006 to 2012. The five-year relative survival rate is 94.3 percent for people with HL who were less than 45 years old at diagnosis.  HL is now considered to be one of the most curable forms of cancer.    The 5-year relative survival rate for people with NHL has risen from 31 percent in whites from 1960 to 1963 (only data available) to 72.6 percent for all races from 2006 to 2012.   Deaths   In 2017, an estimated 21,210 members of the US population are expected to die from lymphoma (20,140 NHL and 1,070 HL).     Myeloma    New Cases   An estimated 30,280 new cases of myeloma (17,490 males and 12,790 females) are expected to be diagnosed in the US in 2017.   Prevalence   An estimated 110,345 people in the US are living with, or in remission from, myeloma.   Survival   Five-year relative survival has increased from 12 percent in 1960-1963 among whites (only data available) to 50.2 percent from 2006 to 2012 (for all races and ethnicities).  The 3-year survival rate as of January 1, 2013, is 65.0 percent (for all races and ethnicities).   Deaths   Approximately 12,590 deaths from myeloma are anticipated in 2017.     Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)    New Cases   For the 5-year period from 2009 to 2013, there were approximately 76,755 new cases of MDS throughout the US, averaging an estimated 15,351 cases per year.  Approximately 43,518 cases were diagnosed in males (averaging 8,704 per year) and approximately 33,237 cases were diagnosed in females (averaging 6,647 per year).

Click on the links below to view statistics about each disease:   General Blood Cancers  Leukemia  Lymphoma  Myeloma  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)     General Blood Cancers    New Cases   Approximately every 3 minutes one person in the United States (US) is diagnosed with a blood cancer.  An estimated combined total of 172,910 people in the US are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma in 2017.  New cases of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to account for 10.2 percent of the estimated 1,688,780 new cancer cases diagnosed in the US in 2017.    Prevalence   Prevalence is the estimated number of people alive on a certain date in a population who previously had a diagnosis of the disease. An estimated 1,290,773 people in the US are either living with, or are in remission from, leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma.   Survival   Relative survival compares the survival rate of a person diagnosed with a disease to that of a person without the disease. The most recent survival data available may not fully represent the outcomes of all current therapies and, as a result, may underestimate survival to a small degree.    Deaths   Approximately every 9 minutes, someone in the US dies from a blood cancer. This statistic represents approximately 160 people each day or more than six people every hour.  Leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to cause the deaths of an estimated 58,300 people in the US in 2017.  These diseases are expected to account for 9.7 percent of the deaths from cancer in 2017, based on the estimated total of 600,920 cancer deaths.     Leukemia    New Cases   In 2017, 62,130 people are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia.   Prevalence   There are an estimated 363,794 people living with, or in remission from, leukemia in the US.   Survival   The overall five-year relative survival rate for leukemia has more than quadrupled since 1960. From 1960 to 1963, the five-year relative survival rate among whites (only data available) with leukemia was 14 percent. From 1975 to 1977, the five-year relative survival rate for the total population with leukemia was 34.2 percent, and from 2006 to 2012, the overall relative survival rate was 62.7 percent.  From 2006-2012, the five-year relative survival rates overall were  CML - 65.9 percent  CLL - 85.1 percent  AML - 26.8 percent overall and 66.8 percent for children and adolescents younger than 15 years  ALL - 70.7 percent overall, 92.3 percent for children and adolescents younger than 15 years, and 94.1 percent for children younger than 5 years.     Deaths   In 2017, 24,500 people are expected to die from leukemia (14,300 males and 10,200 females).  In 2009-2013, leukemia was the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths in men and the sixth most common in women.     Hodgkin (HL) and Non-Hodgkin (NHL) Lymphoma    New Cases   In 2017, there are expected to be 80,500 new cases of lymphoma diagnosed in the US (8,260 cases of HL, 72,240 cases of NHL).   Prevalence   In 2017, there are an estimated 816,634 people living with, or in remission from, lymphoma in the US.  There are 186,607 people living with Hodgkin lymphoma  There are 630,027 people living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma     Survival   The 5-year relative survival rate for people with HL has more than doubled, from 40 percent in whites from 1960 to 1963 (only data available) to 88.5 percent for all races from 2006 to 2012. The five-year relative survival rate is 94.3 percent for people with HL who were less than 45 years old at diagnosis.  HL is now considered to be one of the most curable forms of cancer.    The 5-year relative survival rate for people with NHL has risen from 31 percent in whites from 1960 to 1963 (only data available) to 72.6 percent for all races from 2006 to 2012.   Deaths   In 2017, an estimated 21,210 members of the US population are expected to die from lymphoma (20,140 NHL and 1,070 HL).     Myeloma    New Cases   An estimated 30,280 new cases of myeloma (17,490 males and 12,790 females) are expected to be diagnosed in the US in 2017.   Prevalence   An estimated 110,345 people in the US are living with, or in remission from, myeloma.   Survival   Five-year relative survival has increased from 12 percent in 1960-1963 among whites (only data available) to 50.2 percent from 2006 to 2012 (for all races and ethnicities).  The 3-year survival rate as of January 1, 2013, is 65.0 percent (for all races and ethnicities).   Deaths   Approximately 12,590 deaths from myeloma are anticipated in 2017.     Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)    New Cases   For the 5-year period from 2009 to 2013, there were approximately 76,755 new cases of MDS throughout the US, averaging an estimated 15,351 cases per year.  Approximately 43,518 cases were diagnosed in males (averaging 8,704 per year) and approximately 33,237 cases were diagnosed in females (averaging 6,647 per year).

Leukemia in Children  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Types             Survival Rates for Childhood Leukemias   When discussing cancer survival statistics, doctors often use a number called the 5-year survival rate . This refers to the percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed. With acute leukemias, children who are free of the disease after 5 years are very likely to have been cured, because it’s very rare for these cancers to return after this long.   Survival rates are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of children who had the disease, but they can’t predict what will happen in any child’s case. Knowing the type of leukemia is important in estimating a child’s outlook. But a number of other factors, including the child’s age and leukemia characteristics, can also affect outlook. Many of these factors are discussed in Prognostic Factors In Childhood Leukemia (ALL or AML). Even when taking these other factors into account, survival rates are at best rough estimates. Your child’s doctor is likely to be a good source as to whether these numbers apply to your child, as he or she knows your situation best.  Current 5-year survival rates are based on children first diagnosed and treated more than 5 years ago. Improvements in treatment since then might result in a better outlook for children now being diagnosed.  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)  The 5-year survival rate for children with ALL has greatly increased over time and is now more than 85% overall.  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)  The overall 5-year survival rate for children with AML has also increased over time, and is now in the range of 60% to 70%. However, survival rates vary depending on the subtype of AML and other factors. For example, most studies suggest that the cure rate for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML, is now higher than 80%, but rates are lower for some other subtypes of AML.  Other childhood leukemias  Accurate survival rates for less common forms of childhood leukemia are harder to find.  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML): For JMML, 5-year survival rates of about 50% have been reported.  Chronic leukemias: For chronic leukemias, which are rare in children, 5-year survival rates are less helpful, because some children may live for a long time with the leukemia without actually being cured. In the past, 5-year survival rates for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) were reported to be in the range of 60% to 80%. With newer, more effective medicines developed for CML in recent years, survival rates are likely to be higher now, although these new drugs have not been in use long enough to be sure.

Acute myeloid leukemia or AML is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood. Another name for it is acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. According to the Cleveland Clinic , AML is the most common acute leukemia type in adults.  AML is a type of leukemia. The term “ leukemia ” refers to cancers of the blood cells and bone marrow. Doctors call AML “acute” because the condition can progress rapidly.  The word myeloid or myelogenous refers to the cell type it affects. Myeloid cells are precursors to other blood cells. Usually these cells go on to develop into red blood cells, platelets, and special types of white cells. But in AML, they aren’t able to develop normally.  When a person has AML, their myeloid cells mutate and form leukemic blasts. These cells don’t function as normal cells do. They can keep the body from making normal, healthy cells. Eventually, a person will start to lack red blood cells that carry oxygen, platelets that prevent easy bleeding, and white blood cells that protect the body from diseases. That’s because their body is too busy making the leukemic blast cells. The result can be deadly.  For many people, AML is a treatable disease. Advancements in cancer treatments and doctors’ understanding of the disease mean that more and more people survive the condition each year.  Survival rates What are the survival rates for acute myeloid leukemia?  Ever year doctors diagnose an estimated 20,000 people in the United States with AML. An estimated 10,000 deaths occur on a yearly basis because of the disease. However, this number is for all people with AML, not just the people diagnosed in a year.  Most people with AML receive chemotherapy treatments. These are medicines that kill rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. In patients younger than 60, roughly 70 to 80 percent will go into remission after “induction” (first round) of chemo. Remission means a person doesn’t have symptoms of the disease and their blood cell counts are in a normal range.  Those older than age 60 don’t typically respond to treatment as well. Patients older than 60 also have a higher rate of dying during treatments. Some people who go into remission stay in remission. Still for many AML can return over time  The five-year overall survival rate for AML is 26 percent . This means that of the thousands of people living with AML, an estimated 26 percent are still living five years after their diagnosis. For lower risk AML groups, the five-year-survival-rate is 65 percent.  AML Classification  Different types of AML exist. Doctors often classify them by their cell mutations. Some cell mutation types are known to be more responsive to treatments. Examples include mutated CEBPA and inv(16) CBFB-MYH11 cells.  Some cell mutations can be very treatment-resistant. Examples include del(5q) and inv(3) RPN1-EVI1. Your oncologist will tell you what type or types of cell mutation you may have.  Influencing factors What factors influence survival rate?  The outlook and prognosis for AML varies widely. Doctors take into account many factors when giving someone a prognosis.  Examples of these factors include:  Age  Age can be a major factor in determining AML treatment response. Doctors know that survival rates for those diagnosed with AML is more promising for people who are under the age of 60.  This could be for a number of reasons. Some people older than the age of 60 may not be in good health. This can make it difficult for their bodies to handle the strong chemotherapy medications and other cancer treatments, associated with AML.  AML type  As mentioned earlier, several AML types exist. They’re based on the kind of leukemic cells present in the blood and bone marrow. Some AML types are associated with a better survival outlook than others. Your doctor should discuss the type of cells and genetic changes these cells have with you.  Response to treatment  Sometimes people respond better to treatments than others. If a person receives chemotherapy treatments and their cancer doesn’t come back within five years, they’re usually considered cured. If a person’s cancer comes back or doesn’t respond to treatments at all, their treatment outcome isn’t as favorable.  A prognosis or survival outlook is based on a number of factors. Much of it is based on the outcomes and analysis of your of blood tests , imaging studies, cerebrospinal fluid examinations , and bone marrow biopsies . Some people with a poor prognosis live many more years than a doctor predicts while others may not live as long.  Coping and support How can a person seek support?  Regardless of prognosis, an AML diagnosis can create emotions of fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. You may be unsure where to turn or seek support. Here are a few tips to help you navigate this diagnosis and treatment.  Ask questions: It’s important that you understand your condition. If there’s something you’re uncertain of regarding your diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis, ask your doctor. Examples of questions to ask could include “What are my treatment options?” and “What can I do to prevent AML from coming back?”  Find organizations that provide support: Organizations such as the American Cancer Society (ACS) and Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) offer a number of supportive services. These include arranging rides to treatment and helping you find assistive personnel, such as dietitians or social workers.  Join a support group: Support groups are an excellent way to meet individuals who are going through similar emotions as you. Seeing the successes and mindsets of others can help you know you aren’t alone. In addition to resources such as the ACS and LLS, your oncologist or local hospital may offer support groups.  Reach out to friends and family: Many friends and family will want to help. Let them deliver meals or simply listen to your concerns. Opening up to others can help you maintain a positive frame of mind.  Find enjoyable ways to relieve stress: There are many outlets for you to relieve stress and concern in your life. Meditation or keeping a journal or blog are a few examples. Plus they cost very little to take on and keep up. Finding an outlet that you especially enjoy can do wonders for your mind and spirit.  A cancer diagnosis isn’t a death sentence. It does present the opportunity for you to grow nearer to those closest to you and evaluate how you can live a life you enjoy.

You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 21,380 people of all ages (11,960 men and boys and 9,420 women and girls) in the United States will be diagnosed with AML. AML is the second most common type of leukemia diagnosed in adults and children. It is rare for the disease to occur before age 45; the average age at the time of diagnosis is 67 years.  An estimated 10,590 deaths (6,110 men and boys and 4,480 women and girls) from AML will occur this year.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for people with AML is approximately 27%.  However, it is important to note that survival depends on several factors, including biologic features of the disease and, in particular, a patient’s age (see Subtypes for more information). Although AML is a serious disease, it is treatable and often curable with chemotherapy with or without a bone marrow/stem cell transplant (see the Treatment Options section).  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with AML are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. People should talk with their doctor if they have questions about this information. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years.

The number of deaths was 6.8 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 1.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with leukemia at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 387,728 people living with leukemia in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Leukemia?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  60.6%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from leukemia. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Most blood cells develop from cells in the bone marrow called stem cells . In a person with leukemia, the bone  marrow makes abnormal white blood cells. The abnormal cells are leukemia cells. Unlike normal blood cells, leukemia cells don't die when they should. They may crowd out normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This makes it hard for normal blood cells to do their work. The four main types of leukemia are:   Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)   Adult  Child   Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)   There is no standard staging system for leukemia. The disease is described as untreated, in remission , or recurrent .

Some of the increase is likely to be attributable to changes in the diagnosis, classification and registration of leukaemia, so interpretation of these trends should be undertaken with caution.  One-year age-standardised  net survival for leukaemia (all subtypes combined) in men has increased from 35% during 1971-1972 to 71% during 2010-2011 in England and Wales – an absolute survival difference  of 36 percentage points.[ 1 ] In women, one-year survival has increased from 33% to 66% over the same time period (a difference of 34 percentage points).

Survival depends on many different factors. It depends on your individual condition, type of cancer, treatment and level of fitness. So no one can tell you exactly how long you will live.  These are general statistics based on large groups of patients. Remember, they can’t tell you what will happen in your individual case.  Your doctor can give you more information about your own outlook (prognosis).  You can also talk about this with the Cancer Research UK nurses on freephone 0808 800 4040, from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.  Survival statistics for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)  No UK-wide statistics are available for ALL survival.  The following survival statistics are for people diagnosed with ALL in England between 2008 and 2010. They come from the National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN).  Generally for people with ALL:  around 70 out of 100 people (70%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed  This is for people of all ages. Younger people tend to do much better than older people:  in those aged 14 or younger, more than 90 out of 100 (more than 90%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed  in those aged between 15 and 24, almost 70 out of 100 (almost 70%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after diagnosis  in those aged between 25 and 64, almost 40 out of 100 (almost 40%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed  in those aged 65 or older, almost 15 out of 100 (almost 15%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after diagnosis   What affects survival  Your age affects outlook. Younger people have a better prognosis.  Outlook depends on the specific type of white blood cell the leukaemia affects. It is also affected by changes in your chromosomes or genes. These are called cytogenetic tests. Some specific genetic abnormalities in your leukaemia cells may make your leukaemia harder to treat successfully.  Survival is also affected by how advanced the leukaemia is at diagnosis. If you have a high number of white blood cells in the blood at diagnosis, the outlook is poorer. And your outlook is worse if you have leukaemia cells in your brain or spinal fluid when you are diagnosed.  Your outlook is affected by how well the leukaemia responds to treatment and how long it takes to get a remission. Remission means the leukaemia is not active and doctors cannot find any sign of it. If it takes more than 3 or 4 weeks to get your leukaemia under control, or leukaemia cells are left after your first cycle of chemotherapy, your leukaemia may be more difficult to treat successfully.  If the leukaemia comes back (relapses) after treatment, it is sometimes possible to have a second remission with more chemotherapy.  About these statistics  The terms 1 year survival and 5 year survival don't mean that you will only live for 1 or 5 years. They relate to the number of people who are still alive 1 year or 5 years after their diagnosis of cancer.  Some people live much longer than 5 years.  The statistics on this page are for relative survival. Relative survival takes into account that some people will die of causes other than leukaemia. This gives a more accurate picture of leukaemia survival.  More statistics For more in-depth information about survival and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, go to our Cancer Statistics section .

Prognosis is the word your healthcare team may use to describe your likely outcome
      from your leukemia and its treatment. A prognosis is a calculated guess. It’s a question
      many people have when they learn they have cancer.  Making a choice  The decision to ask about your prognosis is a personal one. It’s up to you to decide
      how much you want to know. Some people find it easier to cope and plan ahead when
      they know their prognosis and the statistics for how well a treatment might work.
      Other people find statistics confusing and frightening. Or they might think statistics
      are too general to be useful.  A doctor who is most familiar with your health is in the best position to discuss
      your prognosis with you and explain what the statistics may mean in your case. At
      the same time, you should keep in mind that your prognosis can change. Cancer and
      cancer treatment outcomes are hard to predict. For instance, a favorable prognosis
      (which means you’re likely going to do well) can change if the cancer keeps growing
      or doesn’t respond to treatment. An unfavorable prognosis can change, too. This can
      happen if treatment controls the AML so it doesn’t grow more.  What goes into a prognosis  When figuring out your prognosis, your doctor will consider all the things that could
      affect the leukemia and its treatment. Your doctor will look at risk estimates about
      the exact type of leukemia you have. These estimates are based on what results researchers
      have seen over decades in many people with the same type of leukemia.  If your AML is likely to respond well to treatment, your doctor will say you have
      a favorable prognosis. If your leukemia is likely to be hard to control, your prognosis
      may be less favorable. In this case, the leukemia may shorten your life. It’s important
      to keep in mind that a prognosis states what’s likely or probable. It is not a prediction
      of what will definitely happen. No doctor can be fully certain about an outcome.  Your prognosis depends mainly on:    The subtype of AML    Your age and overall health    Your health history (such as if you've had a blood disease or have had chemotherapy
            for another cancer in the past)    Gene or chromosome changes in the leukemia cells    If you have a very high white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis (greater than 100,000)    If there are leukemia cells in your brain and spinal cord (called CNS or central nervous
            system involvement). This is very rare.    If you have a bad infection when you're diagnosed    How well your leukemia responds to treatment    Understanding survival rates  Survival rates show how many people live for a certain length of time after being
      told they have cancer. Most often, the numbers used refer to the 5-year survival rate.
      That’s how many people live at least 5 years after being diagnosed.  People whose AML doesn’t come back (relapse) in 5 years are usually cured. People
      who had AML that relapsed but then went into a second remission for 5 years are likely
      to be cured.  What are the survival rates for AML?  AML survival rates vary a lot based on the leukemia subtype and the factors listed
      above. The relative 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with AML is 27%. This
      number is adjusted for the fact that some people with AML will die from causes other
      than AML. It's based on people who were diagnosed between 2006 and 2012. Many new
      and better treatments for AML have become available in recent years. So the prognosis
      for people diagnosed with AML today is likely better. In fact, treatment advances
      have almost doubled the 5-year survival rate for leukemias as a combined group. And
      new treatments are regularly being developed.  It's important to remember: You are not a statistic. Talk with your doctor so that
      you can understand what long-term treatment outcomes you can expect.  Talking with your healthcare provider  You can ask your healthcare provider about survival rates and what you might expect.
      But remember that statistics are based on large groups of people treated at least
      5 years ago. They can’t be used to say what will happen to you. No two people are
      exactly alike. Treatment and how well people respond to treatment vary.

Acute myeloid leukemia or AML is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood. Another name for it is acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. According to the Cleveland Clinic , AML is the most common acute leukemia type in adults.  AML is a type of leukemia. The term “ leukemia ” refers to cancers of the blood cells and bone marrow. Doctors call AML “acute” because the condition can progress rapidly.  The word myeloid or myelogenous refers to the cell type it affects. Myeloid cells are precursors to other blood cells. Usually these cells go on to develop into red blood cells, platelets, and special types of white cells. But in AML, they aren’t able to develop normally.  When a person has AML, their myeloid cells mutate and form leukemic blasts. These cells don’t function as normal cells do. They can keep the body from making normal, healthy cells. Eventually, a person will start to lack red blood cells that carry oxygen, platelets that prevent easy bleeding, and white blood cells that protect the body from diseases. That’s because their body is too busy making the leukemic blast cells. The result can be deadly.  For many people, AML is a treatable disease. Advancements in cancer treatments and doctors’ understanding of the disease mean that more and more people survive the condition each year.  Survival rates What are the survival rates for acute myeloid leukemia?  Ever year doctors diagnose an estimated 20,000 people in the United States with AML. An estimated 10,000 deaths occur on a yearly basis because of the disease. However, this number is for all people with AML, not just the people diagnosed in a year.  Most people with AML receive chemotherapy treatments. These are medicines that kill rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. In patients younger than 60, roughly 70 to 80 percent will go into remission after “induction” (first round) of chemo. Remission means a person doesn’t have symptoms of the disease and their blood cell counts are in a normal range.  Those older than age 60 don’t typically respond to treatment as well. Patients older than 60 also have a higher rate of dying during treatments. Some people who go into remission stay in remission. Still for many AML can return over time  The five-year overall survival rate for AML is 26 percent . This means that of the thousands of people living with AML, an estimated 26 percent are still living five years after their diagnosis. For lower risk AML groups, the five-year-survival-rate is 65 percent.  AML Classification  Different types of AML exist. Doctors often classify them by their cell mutations. Some cell mutation types are known to be more responsive to treatments. Examples include mutated CEBPA and inv(16) CBFB-MYH11 cells.  Some cell mutations can be very treatment-resistant. Examples include del(5q) and inv(3) RPN1-EVI1. Your oncologist will tell you what type or types of cell mutation you may have.  Influencing factors What factors influence survival rate?  The outlook and prognosis for AML varies widely. Doctors take into account many factors when giving someone a prognosis.  Examples of these factors include:  Age  Age can be a major factor in determining AML treatment response. Doctors know that survival rates for those diagnosed with AML is more promising for people who are under the age of 60.  This could be for a number of reasons. Some people older than the age of 60 may not be in good health. This can make it difficult for their bodies to handle the strong chemotherapy medications and other cancer treatments, associated with AML.  AML type  As mentioned earlier, several AML types exist. They’re based on the kind of leukemic cells present in the blood and bone marrow. Some AML types are associated with a better survival outlook than others. Your doctor should discuss the type of cells and genetic changes these cells have with you.  Response to treatment  Sometimes people respond better to treatments than others. If a person receives chemotherapy treatments and their cancer doesn’t come back within five years, they’re usually considered cured. If a person’s cancer comes back or doesn’t respond to treatments at all, their treatment outcome isn’t as favorable.  A prognosis or survival outlook is based on a number of factors. Much of it is based on the outcomes and analysis of your of blood tests , imaging studies, cerebrospinal fluid examinations , and bone marrow biopsies . Some people with a poor prognosis live many more years than a doctor predicts while others may not live as long.  Coping and support How can a person seek support?  Regardless of prognosis, an AML diagnosis can create emotions of fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. You may be unsure where to turn or seek support. Here are a few tips to help you navigate this diagnosis and treatment.  Ask questions: It’s important that you understand your condition. If there’s something you’re uncertain of regarding your diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis, ask your doctor. Examples of questions to ask could include “What are my treatment options?” and “What can I do to prevent AML from coming back?”  Find organizations that provide support: Organizations such as the American Cancer Society (ACS) and Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) offer a number of supportive services. These include arranging rides to treatment and helping you find assistive personnel, such as dietitians or social workers.  Join a support group: Support groups are an excellent way to meet individuals who are going through similar emotions as you. Seeing the successes and mindsets of others can help you know you aren’t alone. In addition to resources such as the ACS and LLS, your oncologist or local hospital may offer support groups.  Reach out to friends and family: Many friends and family will want to help. Let them deliver meals or simply listen to your concerns. Opening up to others can help you maintain a positive frame of mind.  Find enjoyable ways to relieve stress: There are many outlets for you to relieve stress and concern in your life. Meditation or keeping a journal or blog are a few examples. Plus they cost very little to take on and keep up. Finding an outlet that you especially enjoy can do wonders for your mind and spirit.  A cancer diagnosis isn’t a death sentence. It does present the opportunity for you to grow nearer to those closest to you and evaluate how you can live a life you enjoy.

Prognostic Factors in Childhood Leukemia (ALL or AML)    Survival Rates for Childhood Leukemias    What Should You Ask Your Child’s Doctor About Childhood Leukemia?             Leukemia in Children  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Types             Survival Rates for Childhood Leukemias   When discussing cancer survival statistics, doctors often use a number called the 5-year survival rate . This refers to the percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed. With acute leukemias, children who are free of the disease after 5 years are very likely to have been cured, because it’s very rare for these cancers to return after this long.   Survival rates are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of children who had the disease, but they can’t predict what will happen in any child’s case. Knowing the type of leukemia is important in estimating a child’s outlook. But a number of other factors, including the child’s age and leukemia characteristics, can also affect outlook. Many of these factors are discussed in Prognostic Factors In Childhood Leukemia (ALL or AML). Even when taking these other factors into account, survival rates are at best rough estimates. Your child’s doctor is likely to be a good source as to whether these numbers apply to your child, as he or she knows your situation best.  Current 5-year survival rates are based on children first diagnosed and treated more than 5 years ago. Improvements in treatment since then might result in a better outlook for children now being diagnosed.  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)  The 5-year survival rate for children with ALL has greatly increased over time and is now more than 85% overall.  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)  The overall 5-year survival rate for children with AML has also increased over time, and is now in the range of 60% to 70%. However, survival rates vary depending on the subtype of AML and other factors. For example, most studies suggest that the cure rate for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML, is now higher than 80%, but rates are lower for some other subtypes of AML.  Other childhood leukemias  Accurate survival rates for less common forms of childhood leukemia are harder to find.  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML): For JMML, 5-year survival rates of about 50% have been reported.  Chronic leukemias: For chronic leukemias, which are rare in children, 5-year survival rates are less helpful, because some children may live for a long time with the leukemia without actually being cured. In the past, 5-year survival rates for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) were reported to be in the range of 60% to 80%. With newer, more effective medicines developed for CML in recent years, survival rates are likely to be higher now, although these new drugs have not been in use long enough to be sure.

This is most people’s first question, along with “want can I expect to happen.” The doctor’s answer is called a prognosis (an educated guess about the likely course of your disease and how long you might live). Because each person is unique, and each person’s disease is different, a prognosis can be difficult to make. Also, how a disease progresses over time is unpredictable, and less is known about rare diseases than common diseases.  Whether you are an aplastic anemia , MDS or PNH patient, you need to talk to your doctor about your prognosis. This may be hard to hear, but getting a prognosis will give you key information about the treatment decisions you need to make so you can plan for the future.  Prognosis guidelines based on current data  Aplastic Anemia  With standard treatments, about 7 out of 10 aplastic anemia patients get better. Standard treatments include immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with cyclosporine , or a bone marrow transplant . The chance for recovery depends on many factors, including how severe your case is and how you respond to treatment.  MDS  There are many different subtypes of MDS, which are identified by testing the blood and bone marrow. Your MDS subtype is a key factor in a doctor’ decision about your treatment and your prognosis (an educated guess about the likely course of your disease and how long you might live).  To figure out a prognosis for a given patient, doctors also use a prognostic scoring system. The most common one used today is the International Prognostic Scoring System , or IPSS for short. This system looks at three things:   Number of low blood counts you have  Percentage of young white blood cells ( blasts ) in bone marrow cells  Number of cytogenetic changes (abnormal gene changes) in bone marrow cells   This prognostic scoring system tells your doctor how severe your disease is and how likely it is that your MDS might become acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It also gives your doctor a general idea about how long you might live.  With current treatments, patients with lower-risk types of some MDS can live for 5 years or even longer. Patients with higher-risk MDS that becomes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are likely to have a shorter life span. About 30 out of 100 MDS patients will develop AML.  PNH  Many people with PNH live for decades. People with PNH who develop blood clots in key parts of the body or develop MDS ( myelodysplastic syndromes ) or AML (acute myeloid leukemia) may have a shorter life span.  New treatments becoming available for PNH are helping people with PNH to live longer. Older research you may have come across state that PNH patients live an average of 15 to 20 years after diagnosis. More recent research shows how that lifespan has climbed over the past 20 years. It’s possible that PNH patients – who rarely develop MDS or AML – will soon have a lifespan that is normal compared with people their own age.

people are diagnosed with this type of leukemia each year. You will also learn some general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. To see other pages, use the menu.  CLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults. This year, an estimated 20,110 people of all ages (12,310 men and 7,800 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with CLL. CLL is more common in older adults. The average age of people diagnosed with CLL is 71. CLL is rare in children.  It is estimated that 4,660 deaths (2,880 men and 1,780 women) from CLL will occur this year. The survival rate for people with CLL varies widely according to the stage of the disease (see Stages .)  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for people with CLL is 83%.  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with CLL are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years. People should talk with their doctor if they have questions about this information.

Click on the links below to view statistics about each disease:   General Blood Cancers  Leukemia  Lymphoma  Myeloma  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)     General Blood Cancers    New Cases   Approximately every 3 minutes one person in the United States (US) is diagnosed with a blood cancer.  An estimated combined total of 172,910 people in the US are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma in 2017.  New cases of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to account for 10.2 percent of the estimated 1,688,780 new cancer cases diagnosed in the US in 2017.    Prevalence   Prevalence is the estimated number of people alive on a certain date in a population who previously had a diagnosis of the disease. An estimated 1,290,773 people in the US are either living with, or are in remission from, leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma.   Survival   Relative survival compares the survival rate of a person diagnosed with a disease to that of a person without the disease. The most recent survival data available may not fully represent the outcomes of all current therapies and, as a result, may underestimate survival to a small degree.    Deaths   Approximately every 9 minutes, someone in the US dies from a blood cancer. This statistic represents approximately 160 people each day or more than six people every hour.  Leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to cause the deaths of an estimated 58,300 people in the US in 2017.  These diseases are expected to account for 9.7 percent of the deaths from cancer in 2017, based on the estimated total of 600,920 cancer deaths.     Leukemia    New Cases   In 2017, 62,130 people are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia.   Prevalence   There are an estimated 363,794 people living with, or in remission from, leukemia in the US.

Survival   Relative survival compares the survival rate of a person diagnosed with a disease to that of a person without the disease. The most recent survival data available may not fully represent the outcomes of all current therapies and, as a result, may underestimate survival to a small degree.    Deaths   Approximately every 9 minutes, someone in the US dies from a blood cancer. This statistic represents approximately 160 people each day or more than six people every hour.  Leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to cause the deaths of an estimated 58,300 people in the US in 2017.

Click on the links below to view statistics about each disease:   General Blood Cancers  Leukemia  Lymphoma  Myeloma  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)     General Blood Cancers    New Cases   Approximately every 3 minutes one person in the United States (US) is diagnosed with a blood cancer.  An estimated combined total of 172,910 people in the US are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma in 2017.  New cases of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to account for 10.2 percent of the estimated 1,688,780 new cancer cases diagnosed in the US in 2017.    Prevalence   Prevalence is the estimated number of people alive on a certain date in a population who previously had a diagnosis of the disease. An estimated 1,290,773 people in the US are either living with, or are in remission from, leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma.   Survival   Relative survival compares the survival rate of a person diagnosed with a disease to that of a person without the disease. The most recent survival data available may not fully represent the outcomes of all current therapies and, as a result, may underestimate survival to a small degree.    Deaths   Approximately every 9 minutes, someone in the US dies from a blood cancer. This statistic represents approximately 160 people each day or more than six people every hour.  Leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are expected to cause the deaths of an estimated 58,300 people in the US in 2017.  These diseases are expected to account for 9.7 percent of the deaths from cancer in 2017, based on the estimated total of 600,920 cancer deaths.     Leukemia    New Cases   In 2017, 62,130 people are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia.   Prevalence   There are an estimated 363,794 people living with, or in remission from, leukemia in the US.   Survival   The overall five-year relative survival rate for leukemia has more than quadrupled since 1960. From 1960 to 1963, the five-year relative survival rate among whites (only data available) with leukemia was 14 percent. From 1975 to 1977, the five-year relative survival rate for the total population with leukemia was 34.2 percent, and from 2006 to 2012, the overall relative survival rate was 62.7 percent.  From 2006-2012, the five-year relative survival rates overall were  CML - 65.9 percent  CLL - 85.1 percent  AML - 26.8 percent overall and 66.8 percent for children and adolescents younger than 15 years  ALL - 70.7 percent overall, 92.3 percent for children and adolescents younger than 15 years, and 94.1 percent for children younger than 5 years.     Deaths   In 2017, 24,500 people are expected to die from leukemia (14,300 males and 10,200 females).  In 2009-2013, leukemia was the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths in men and the sixth most common in women.     Hodgkin (HL) and Non-Hodgkin (NHL) Lymphoma    New Cases   In 2017, there are expected to be 80,500 new cases of lymphoma diagnosed in the US (8,260 cases of HL, 72,240 cases of NHL).   Prevalence   In 2017, there are an estimated 816,634 people living with, or in remission from, lymphoma in the US.  There are 186,607 people living with Hodgkin lymphoma  There are 630,027 people living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma     Survival   The 5-year relative survival rate for people with HL has more than doubled, from 40 percent in whites from 1960 to 1963 (only data available) to 88.5 percent for all races from 2006 to 2012. The five-year relative survival rate is 94.3 percent for people with HL who were less than 45 years old at diagnosis.  HL is now considered to be one of the most curable forms of cancer.    The 5-year relative survival rate for people with NHL has risen from 31 percent in whites from 1960 to 1963 (only data available) to 72.6 percent for all races from 2006 to 2012.   Deaths   In 2017, an estimated 21,210 members of the US population are expected to die from lymphoma (20,140 NHL and 1,070 HL).

Leukemia in Children  Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Types             Survival Rates for Childhood Leukemias   When discussing cancer survival statistics, doctors often use a number called the 5-year survival rate . This refers to the percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed. With acute leukemias, children who are free of the disease after 5 years are very likely to have been cured, because it’s very rare for these cancers to return after this long.   Survival rates are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of children who had the disease, but they can’t predict what will happen in any child’s case. Knowing the type of leukemia is important in estimating a child’s outlook. But a number of other factors, including the child’s age and leukemia characteristics, can also affect outlook. Many of these factors are discussed in Prognostic Factors In Childhood Leukemia (ALL or AML). Even when taking these other factors into account, survival rates are at best rough estimates. Your child’s doctor is likely to be a good source as to whether these numbers apply to your child, as he or she knows your situation best.  Current 5-year survival rates are based on children first diagnosed and treated more than 5 years ago. Improvements in treatment since then might result in a better outlook for children now being diagnosed.  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)  The 5-year survival rate for children with ALL has greatly increased over time and is now more than 85% overall.  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)  The overall 5-year survival rate for children with AML has also increased over time, and is now in the range of 60% to 70%. However, survival rates vary depending on the subtype of AML and other factors. For example, most studies suggest that the cure rate for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML, is now higher than 80%, but rates are lower for some other subtypes of AML.  Other childhood leukemias  Accurate survival rates for less common forms of childhood leukemia are harder to find.  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML): For JMML, 5-year survival rates of about 50% have been reported.  Chronic leukemias: For chronic leukemias, which are rare in children, 5-year survival rates are less helpful, because some children may live for a long time with the leukemia without actually being cured. In the past, 5-year survival rates for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) were reported to be in the range of 60% to 80%. With newer, more effective medicines developed for CML in recent years, survival rates are likely to be higher now, although these new drugs have not been in use long enough to be sure.

Acute myeloid leukemia or AML is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood. Another name for it is acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. According to the Cleveland Clinic , AML is the most common acute leukemia type in adults.  AML is a type of leukemia. The term “ leukemia ” refers to cancers of the blood cells and bone marrow. Doctors call AML “acute” because the condition can progress rapidly.  The word myeloid or myelogenous refers to the cell type it affects. Myeloid cells are precursors to other blood cells. Usually these cells go on to develop into red blood cells, platelets, and special types of white cells. But in AML, they aren’t able to develop normally.  When a person has AML, their myeloid cells mutate and form leukemic blasts. These cells don’t function as normal cells do. They can keep the body from making normal, healthy cells. Eventually, a person will start to lack red blood cells that carry oxygen, platelets that prevent easy bleeding, and white blood cells that protect the body from diseases. That’s because their body is too busy making the leukemic blast cells. The result can be deadly.  For many people, AML is a treatable disease. Advancements in cancer treatments and doctors’ understanding of the disease mean that more and more people survive the condition each year.  Survival rates What are the survival rates for acute myeloid leukemia?  Ever year doctors diagnose an estimated 20,000 people in the United States with AML. An estimated 10,000 deaths occur on a yearly basis because of the disease. However, this number is for all people with AML, not just the people diagnosed in a year.  Most people with AML receive chemotherapy treatments. These are medicines that kill rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. In patients younger than 60, roughly 70 to 80 percent will go into remission after “induction” (first round) of chemo. Remission means a person doesn’t have symptoms of the disease and their blood cell counts are in a normal range.  Those older than age 60 don’t typically respond to treatment as well. Patients older than 60 also have a higher rate of dying during treatments. Some people who go into remission stay in remission. Still for many AML can return over time  The five-year overall survival rate for AML is 26 percent . This means that of the thousands of people living with AML, an estimated 26 percent are still living five years after their diagnosis. For lower risk AML groups, the five-year-survival-rate is 65 percent.  AML Classification  Different types of AML exist. Doctors often classify them by their cell mutations. Some cell mutation types are known to be more responsive to treatments. Examples include mutated CEBPA and inv(16) CBFB-MYH11 cells.  Some cell mutations can be very treatment-resistant. Examples include del(5q) and inv(3) RPN1-EVI1. Your oncologist will tell you what type or types of cell mutation you may have.  Influencing factors What factors influence survival rate?  The outlook and prognosis for AML varies widely. Doctors take into account many factors when giving someone a prognosis.  Examples of these factors include:  Age  Age can be a major factor in determining AML treatment response. Doctors know that survival rates for those diagnosed with AML is more promising for people who are under the age of 60.  This could be for a number of reasons. Some people older than the age of 60 may not be in good health. This can make it difficult for their bodies to handle the strong chemotherapy medications and other cancer treatments, associated with AML.  AML type  As mentioned earlier, several AML types exist. They’re based on the kind of leukemic cells present in the blood and bone marrow. Some AML types are associated with a better survival outlook than others. Your doctor should discuss the type of cells and genetic changes these cells have with you.  Response to treatment  Sometimes people respond better to treatments than others. If a person receives chemotherapy treatments and their cancer doesn’t come back within five years, they’re usually considered cured. If a person’s cancer comes back or doesn’t respond to treatments at all, their treatment outcome isn’t as favorable.  A prognosis or survival outlook is based on a number of factors. Much of it is based on the outcomes and analysis of your of blood tests , imaging studies, cerebrospinal fluid examinations , and bone marrow biopsies . Some people with a poor prognosis live many more years than a doctor predicts while others may not live as long.  Coping and support How can a person seek support?  Regardless of prognosis, an AML diagnosis can create emotions of fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. You may be unsure where to turn or seek support. Here are a few tips to help you navigate this diagnosis and treatment.  Ask questions: It’s important that you understand your condition. If there’s something you’re uncertain of regarding your diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis, ask your doctor. Examples of questions to ask could include “What are my treatment options?” and “What can I do to prevent AML from coming back?”  Find organizations that provide support: Organizations such as the American Cancer Society (ACS) and Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) offer a number of supportive services. These include arranging rides to treatment and helping you find assistive personnel, such as dietitians or social workers.  Join a support group: Support groups are an excellent way to meet individuals who are going through similar emotions as you. Seeing the successes and mindsets of others can help you know you aren’t alone. In addition to resources such as the ACS and LLS, your oncologist or local hospital may offer support groups.  Reach out to friends and family: Many friends and family will want to help. Let them deliver meals or simply listen to your concerns. Opening up to others can help you maintain a positive frame of mind.  Find enjoyable ways to relieve stress: There are many outlets for you to relieve stress and concern in your life. Meditation or keeping a journal or blog are a few examples. Plus they cost very little to take on and keep up. Finding an outlet that you especially enjoy can do wonders for your mind and spirit.  A cancer diagnosis isn’t a death sentence. It does present the opportunity for you to grow nearer to those closest to you and evaluate how you can live a life you enjoy.

You will also read general information on surviving the disease. Remember, survival rates depend on several factors. Use the menu to see other pages.  This year, an estimated 21,380 people of all ages (11,960 men and boys and 9,420 women and girls) in the United States will be diagnosed with AML. AML is the second most common type of leukemia diagnosed in adults and children. It is rare for the disease to occur before age 45; the average age at the time of diagnosis is 67 years.  An estimated 10,590 deaths (6,110 men and boys and 4,480 women and girls) from AML will occur this year.  The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for people with AML is approximately 27%.  However, it is important to note that survival depends on several factors, including biologic features of the disease and, in particular, a patient’s age (see Subtypes for more information). Although AML is a serious disease, it is treatable and often curable with chemotherapy with or without a bone marrow/stem cell transplant (see the Treatment Options section).  It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with AML are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with this cancer in the United States. People should talk with their doctor if they have questions about this information. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years.

The number of deaths was 6.8 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 1.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with leukemia at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 387,728 people living with leukemia in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Leukemia?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  60.6%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from leukemia. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Most blood cells develop from cells in the bone marrow called stem cells . In a person with leukemia, the bone  marrow makes abnormal white blood cells. The abnormal cells are leukemia cells. Unlike normal blood cells, leukemia cells don't die when they should. They may crowd out normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This makes it hard for normal blood cells to do their work. The four main types of leukemia are:   Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)   Adult  Child   Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)   There is no standard staging system for leukemia. The disease is described as untreated, in remission , or recurrent .

Some of the increase is likely to be attributable to changes in the diagnosis, classification and registration of leukaemia, so interpretation of these trends should be undertaken with caution.  One-year age-standardised  net survival for leukaemia (all subtypes combined) in men has increased from 35% during 1971-1972 to 71% during 2010-2011 in England and Wales – an absolute survival difference  of 36 percentage points.[ 1 ] In women, one-year survival has increased from 33% to 66% over the same time period (a difference of 34 percentage points).

Survival depends on many different factors. It depends on your individual condition, type of cancer, treatment and level of fitness. So no one can tell you exactly how long you will live.  These are general statistics based on large groups of patients. Remember, they can’t tell you what will happen in your individual case.  Your doctor can give you more information about your own outlook (prognosis).  You can also talk about this with the Cancer Research UK nurses on freephone 0808 800 4040, from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.  Survival statistics for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)  No UK-wide statistics are available for ALL survival.  The following survival statistics are for people diagnosed with ALL in England between 2008 and 2010. They come from the National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN).  Generally for people with ALL:  around 70 out of 100 people (70%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed  This is for people of all ages. Younger people tend to do much better than older people:  in those aged 14 or younger, more than 90 out of 100 (more than 90%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed  in those aged between 15 and 24, almost 70 out of 100 (almost 70%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after diagnosis  in those aged between 25 and 64, almost 40 out of 100 (almost 40%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed  in those aged 65 or older, almost 15 out of 100 (almost 15%) will survive their leukaemia for 5 years or more after diagnosis   What affects survival  Your age affects outlook. Younger people have a better prognosis.  Outlook depends on the specific type of white blood cell the leukaemia affects. It is also affected by changes in your chromosomes or genes. These are called cytogenetic tests. Some specific genetic abnormalities in your leukaemia cells may make your leukaemia harder to treat successfully.  Survival is also affected by how advanced the leukaemia is at diagnosis. If you have a high number of white blood cells in the blood at diagnosis, the outlook is poorer. And your outlook is worse if you have leukaemia cells in your brain or spinal fluid when you are diagnosed.  Your outlook is affected by how well the leukaemia responds to treatment and how long it takes to get a remission. Remission means the leukaemia is not active and doctors cannot find any sign of it. If it takes more than 3 or 4 weeks to get your leukaemia under control, or leukaemia cells are left after your first cycle of chemotherapy, your leukaemia may be more difficult to treat successfully.  If the leukaemia comes back (relapses) after treatment, it is sometimes possible to have a second remission with more chemotherapy.  About these statistics  The terms 1 year survival and 5 year survival don't mean that you will only live for 1 or 5 years. They relate to the number of people who are still alive 1 year or 5 years after their diagnosis of cancer.  Some people live much longer than 5 years.  The statistics on this page are for relative survival. Relative survival takes into account that some people will die of causes other than leukaemia. This gives a more accurate picture of leukaemia survival.  More statistics For more in-depth information about survival and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, go to our Cancer Statistics section .

Prognosis is the word your healthcare team may use to describe your likely outcome
      from your leukemia and its treatment. A prognosis is a calculated guess. It’s a question
      many people have when they learn they have cancer.  Making a choice  The decision to ask about your prognosis is a personal one. It’s up to you to decide
      how much you want to know. Some people find it easier to cope and plan ahead when
      they know their prognosis and the statistics for how well a treatment might work.
      Other people find statistics confusing and frightening. Or they might think statistics
      are too general to be useful.  A doctor who is most familiar with your health is in the best position to discuss
      your prognosis with you and explain what the statistics may mean in your case. At
      the same time, you should keep in mind that your prognosis can change. Cancer and
      cancer treatment outcomes are hard to predict. For instance, a favorable prognosis
      (which means you’re likely going to do well) can change if the cancer keeps growing
      or doesn’t respond to treatment. An unfavorable prognosis can change, too. This can
      happen if treatment controls the AML so it doesn’t grow more.  What goes into a prognosis  When figuring out your prognosis, your doctor will consider all the things that could
      affect the leukemia and its treatment. Your doctor will look at risk estimates about
      the exact type of leukemia you have. These estimates are based on what results researchers
      have seen over decades in many people with the same type of leukemia.  If your AML is likely to respond well to treatment, your doctor will say you have
      a favorable prognosis. If your leukemia is likely to be hard to control, your prognosis
      may be less favorable. In this case, the leukemia may shorten your life. It’s important
      to keep in mind that a prognosis states what’s likely or probable. It is not a prediction
      of what will definitely happen. No doctor can be fully certain about an outcome.  Your prognosis depends mainly on:    The subtype of AML    Your age and overall health    Your health history (such as if you've had a blood disease or have had chemotherapy
            for another cancer in the past)    Gene or chromosome changes in the leukemia cells    If you have a very high white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis (greater than 100,000)    If there are leukemia cells in your brain and spinal cord (called CNS or central nervous
            system involvement). This is very rare.    If you have a bad infection when you're diagnosed    How well your leukemia responds to treatment    Understanding survival rates  Survival rates show how many people live for a certain length of time after being
      told they have cancer. Most often, the numbers used refer to the 5-year survival rate.
      That’s how many people live at least 5 years after being diagnosed.  People whose AML doesn’t come back (relapse) in 5 years are usually cured. People
      who had AML that relapsed but then went into a second remission for 5 years are likely
      to be cured.  What are the survival rates for AML?  AML survival rates vary a lot based on the leukemia subtype and the factors listed
      above. The relative 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with AML is 27%. This
      number is adjusted for the fact that some people with AML will die from causes other
      than AML. It's based on people who were diagnosed between 2006 and 2012. Many new
      and better treatments for AML have become available in recent years. So the prognosis
      for people diagnosed with AML today is likely better. In fact, treatment advances
      have almost doubled the 5-year survival rate for leukemias as a combined group. And
      new treatments are regularly being developed.  It's important to remember: You are not a statistic. Talk with your doctor so that
      you can understand what long-term treatment outcomes you can expect.  Talking with your healthcare provider  You can ask your healthcare provider about survival rates and what you might expect.
      But remember that statistics are based on large groups of people treated at least
      5 years ago. They can’t be used to say what will happen to you. No two people are
      exactly alike. Treatment and how well people respond to treatment vary.
