Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

When your twins are a boy and girl pair, the answer is easy, but people don't always realize it. Many think that being identical twins refers to how twins look and not how they form. Take a look at the biology that determines the sex combinations that are possible with identical and fraternal twins. Can Boy/Girl Twins Be Identical? The short answer is no.         They are always fraternal. The terms identical and fraternal don't describe what the twins look like, but actually how they form. Identical ( monozygotic ) twins are always of the same sex because they form from a single zygote (fertilized egg) that contains either male (XY) or female (XX) sex chromosomes. Therefore, boy/girl twins are always fraternal or ( dizygotic ); they can only form from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two separate sperm. Fraternal twins can be either two girls, two boys, or one of each. These are the possible sex combinations: Two girl twins can be either identical or fraternal (monozygotic or dizygotic). Two boy twins can be either identical or fraternal (monozygotic or dizygotic). A set of boy/girl twins can only be fraternal (dizygotic). Boy/girl twins cannot be identical (monozygotic). Identical Twins Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two.   Before it splits, it is either male or female. After it splits, there are either two males or two females. Both parts of the fertilized egg implant in the uterus and each produces one of the twins. Identical twins have the same genetic origin. No direct cause of monozygotic twinning has been determined; it is not hereditary.         Monozygotic twins represent about one-third of all twins. They may look remarkably similar, and it may be difficult to tell them apart . Fraternal Twins Fraternal twins are two genetically unique individuals as they come from two separate eggs that are fertilized by separate sperm. The resulting egg/sperm combination can be male or female. The result is either two male twins, two female twins, or one male and one female. The genetic similarity between fraternal twins is the same as any two siblings (about 50 percent if they have the same mother and father). They may look alike, or not, just like any sisters and brothers. Fraternal twins are the most common form of twins, representing about two-thirds of all twins. Dizygotic twinning can be hereditary and run in families . Also, most twins and multiples that result from fertility enhancing treatments, such as drugs or procedures like in-vitro fertilization, are dizygotic rather than monozygotic. Exception to the Twin Sex Rule Every rule has exceptions, of course. In this case, they are extremely rare exceptions, and it's not likely that the average person would ever encounter twins in this situation. Note that there have been a few reported cases of a genetic mutation in monozygotic male twins.         For some reason, after the zygote splits, one twin loses a Y chromosome and develops as a female. The female twin would have Turner syndrome, characterized by short stature and lack of ovarian development. It's extremely rare; less than 10 cases have been confirmed. Given the odds, it's safe to assume that 99.9 percent of all boy/girl twins are fraternal. Twins That Are Genetically Dissimilar While identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and share the same DNA combination, there are more possibilities for fraternal twins. Besides being the offspring of two sperm and egg combinations, they may have different genetic donors.  Here are the different combinations: Fraternal twins could be produced when eggs from one woman are fertilized by sperm from two different men. This can happen with unassisted conception and with in-vitro fertilization. In this case, the twins would be half-siblings. A woman may carry twins conceived in-vitro with donor eggs, which could come from two different women. If they are fertilized by sperm from the same man, the twins would be half-siblings. Donor eggs from two different women could be fertilized by sperm from two different men. In this case, the twins may have no shared DNA unless the sperm and egg donors were related. They would be similar to step-siblings. A Word From Verywell You are likely to have to answer the same questions about your twins repeatedly.

What may increase my chances of having twins naturally?  How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins?    How common are twins or more? A lot depends on whether you conceived your twins naturally, or with the help of fertility treatment.  After natural conception , just over one per cent of pregnancies are twins (NCCWCH 2013, NHS 2014) .  For babies born as a result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), where two embryos are put back in the mum's womb (uterus), 24 per cent of births result in twins or triplets (HFEA 2014) . This is about 20 times higher than the rate for natural conception.  Overall, twins , triplets and more account for about three per cent of babies who are born in the UK (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . Are twins more common than they used to be? Yes. The number of twins and triplets born in the UK has increased a lot in the past three decades (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . This increase is mainly because more couples are using fertility treatments to conceive.  Another factor is that women are having babies later in life (NHS 2014) . Older mums have a higher chance of conceiving twins (NHS 2014) . How likely is it I'll have more than one baby after fertility treatment? IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can make it much more likely that you'll conceive multiples than if you'd conceived naturally, but only if you have two embryos transferred (HFEA 2014) .  Fertility clinics have reduced the number of cases where they transfer more than one embryo to a mum receiving treatment. This is because the regulating body, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), now encourages the transfer of one embyro at a time (HFEA 2015) . This is called elective single embryo transfer (eSET).  However, particularly for women aged 35 or over, IVF still often involves introducing two embryos into a woman's womb (HFEA 2015) , raising the chance of twins about 20 times.  Some fertility drugs such as clomifene or gonadotrophins stimulate the ovaries. This increases the chance that several eggs will be released in one go. About eight per cent of women who take the fertility drug clomifene have a multiple pregnancy, usually twins (EMC 2014) .  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have been unsuccessful at getting pregnant with clomifene, have a 36 per cent chance of multiple pregnancy if they take gonadotrophins (NCCWCH 2013) . What may increase my chances of having twins naturally? The chances of having twins increases if you are 35 or older (NHS 2014, Utting and Bewley 2011) . As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which can trigger the ovaries to release several eggs in a single month.  Non-identical twins tend to run in families . This is probably because of an inherited tendency to release more than one egg that then causes this type of twinning. So if you're female and non-identical twins run in your side of the family, you're more likely to have them yourself (NHS 2014) .  If you are a black woman, especially if you are of Central African descent, you're also slightly more likely to have twins (NHS 2014, Smits and Monden 2011) . How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins? The likelihood of you having identical twins is about one in 350 to 400 (NHS 2014) . About a third of twins are identical (McAslan Fraser 2012) .  Whether or not you conceive identical twins seems to be entirely down to chance. Identical twins develop when one fertilised egg divides into two. Nobody knows what causes an egg to split and become identical twins (NHS 2014) .  If you think you might be expecting twins, find out how soon you'll know for sure .

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

So… the odds aren’t exactly with you. Or are they? Turns out, there are a number of factors that can affect your odds of getting pregnant with multiples and having twin babies. These include your age, diet, number of pregnancies you’ve had, ethnicity, location, body type, and more. So what are your chancing of having twins or multiples? Take our just-for-fun quiz to find out instantly!  1. Do you have fraternal twins in your family?

Nigerian  African  Caucasian  Hispanic or Asian  Other 4. Where do you live?  Nigeria  Central Africa  North America or Europe  Latin America or Asia  Other 5. Do you eat a high fat diet?  Yep, full fat pastured yogurt, coconut oil, and pastured bacon  Yes, but it mostly comes from conventional animal products  I try to limit my consumption of fat 6. Do you frequently eat large amounts of phytoestrogen foods such as soy, tempeh, flax, sesame seeds, oats, barley, dried beans, lentils, yams, alfalfa, and mung beans?  Yes, I eat large servings of those foods daily  Sure, but not daily  No, I hardly ever eat those foods 7. How old are you?  Under 35  35-39  Over 40 8.

Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I am told you will need to eat more but when does that start? There does not seem to be a lot of information on twins and how you deal with health and changes over a single birth! I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ?

So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer.

Around 90% of all multiples are made up of twins; the remaining 10% is with triplets, quadruplets and very occasionally   quintuplets and more. In recent years there has been a big increase in the numbers of twins being born. This is due to advancing maternal age, assisted reproduction technology, as well as the use of fertility drugs.  Importantly, better neonatal care has meant that premature twins have a better chance of survival than ever before.  There are two types of twins – identical or monozygotic (one egg), and non-identical or dizygotic (two eggs) twins. Other names for identical twins are non-fraternal twins, and non-identical twins are sometimes called fraternal twins.  It is thought that twin pregnancies are far more common than we are aware of – perhaps as many as 5% of all pregnancies at 12 weeks involve a twin. Though not all will continue to develop as they need to in order to form two babies. Most commonly, this is thought to be due to a major interruption occurring with healthy cell maturation and division.  How do identical twins happen?  Identical twins form when one egg has been fertilised by one sperm and the zygote splits into two.  This happens at the very earliest stage of development, when the zygote is no more than a cluster of a few cells.  Dividing this early in conception means that each baby has exactly the same genetic information as the other.  Identical twins can also occur when one a woman has undergone fertility assistance and has had one fertilised egg returned to her uterus. If this egg then splits into two, an identical twin pregnancy can result.  Identical twins are not dependent on race, country or ethnicity. The odds of having identical twins are the same for every couple, in every pregnancy, wherever they live in the world.  Around one in every three sets of twins born is identical, and the remaining 2/3 is of the non-identical variety.  What increases the odds of having identical twins?   Luck needs to be on your side.  Identical twins do not run in families and can happen for any couple with any pregnancy.  Non-identical twins are influenced by genetics; women whose mothers or grandmothers had non-identical twins do have more chance of having non-identical twins themselves.  But identical twins are just random.  Some families do seem to have a higher than average number of identical twins. Though this can only be contributed to luck, coincidence and chance rather than any familial genetic tendency.   How do non-identical twins happen?  Non-identical twins are uniquely separate individuals who just happen to be gestating at the same time and place as each other. Non-identical twins form from two completely separate eggs which are fertilised by two completely separate sperm. These fraternal twins are no more alike than any other siblings in a family with the same biological mother and father.  Because identical twins share the same genes, they are always the same gender. But non-identical twins may be the same gender or the opposite because they only share 50% of the same genetic coding.  Some people still believe that the incidence of having twins skips a generation but this is not true.  What increases the odds of having non-identical twins?   Advancing maternal age.  Women who are aged in their 30’s and 40’s have significantly higher chances of conceiving with twins.  Younger women, especially those aged in their 20’s, do not have as much chance.  Having assisted reproductive technology, in particular taking medication which increases ovulation. This makes perfect sense because the more eggs which are supported towards maturity each month, and which are then released, means the more that are available to be fertilised.  The more pregnancies a woman has already had, the higher her chances of conceiving with non-identical twins.  If a woman is a fraternal-non-identical twin herself, if she has siblings who are fraternal twins or her mother/grandmother had fraternal twins, then she is more likely to as well.  Race – Black African women are more likely to have twins than women from any other ethnic descent.   What causes the fertilised egg to separate into two?  The exact reason why this happens is still a mystery. Over the years there has been a lot of research and time invested into finding out why some zygotes split into two and others don’t.  But the truth is we still do not know why.  In reality, the splitting of one fertilised egg is a malformation of the natural processes of conception.  When are identical twins actually formed?  Though all identical twins are formed very early in pregnancy, there is some variation in exactly how early the fertilised egg splits into two.  This can happen at the two cell stage on Day 2, the early blastocyst stage on Day 4, or in the late blastocyst stage on Day 6.  The stage when the egg splits into two will determine where the fertilised eggs will implant in the uterine wall.  Once the embryo gets to the 8 cells stage the foetal DNA takes over.  The stage at which the egg splits will also determine if the babies have their own amniotic membranes and placenta or if they share. Essentially, the earlier the egg splits, the more independent each twin will be by having their own amnion, chorion and placenta.  Early splitting also means that the twins are perhaps less identical than those who separate at the late blastocyst stage. Around a quarter of all identical twins are said to be mirror images of each other. This means that the left side of one twin exactly matches the right side of the other. How amazing is that!  Although identical twins share the same DNA and genetic coding, they are still unique little individuals. Small differences separate them and although at birth they can appear like little clones of each other, they are far from it. As identical twins grow, their unique qualities (particularly in relation to their personalities) become more apparent. The environment in which they are raised as well as their own personalities help to shape the adults they will become. This is exactly the same as any other baby born the world over.  How will I know if I’ve conceived with twins?  Because the splitting of the zygote occurs so early in pregnancy, mothers are not initially aware they have conceived with twins. It’s not until twins may be suspected because of the intensity of pregnancy symptoms, or if they have been diagnosed through ultrasound, that a couple may know they are expecting twins.  Is it obvious at birth that twins are identical?  Even at birth it can be difficult to be sure if twins are identical or non-identical. Identical twins can still be born with their own set of membranes and this is not a marker for them to be non-identical. It’s not always clear simply by looking or examining the twins to know if they are identical or not.  The only way to be 100% sure is to do DNA testing on each twin and see what genetic information they share. This can be done in the early neonatal period by taking a swab of tissue from inside each baby’s cheek. This is painless and non-invasive.  The other way to check is to take a blood test and do blood grouping. Identical twins will share the same genetic information so the same genetic markers can be identified. Whereas non-identical twins can be very different; much the same as any other siblings with the same parents. They share around half the same genetic information and traits with each other.  What are the risks of having identical twins?   If the identical twins share a placenta they are at a higher risk of having twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This often results in one twin gaining more nourishment than the other, and having a higher birth weight as a result.  Umbilical cord entanglement and compression if the twins share an amniotic sac. Purely because of the crowded conditions which occur in the mother’s uterus. With identical and non-identical twins, there is an increased risk of pregnancy and birth complications. There is also an increased likelihood of prematurity and associated problems.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

Dizygotic twins are also known as fraternal or non-identical twins. They are the most common type of twins. Unlike monozygotic twins (also known as identical twins), dizygotic twins do not share the same genes. Monozygotic twins share 100 percent of each other genes. Dizygotic twins share only 50 percent.         This is the same genetic similarity found between siblings conceived and born at different times. Why Might Someone Conceive Dizygotic Twins? Dizygotic twins may occur if two or more oocytes (eggs) are released in one cycle. If each is fertilized, dizygotic twins may result. During IVF treatment , if two or more embryos are transferred, you may also get pregnant with twins (or more.) Fertility drugs are a common cause of dizygotic twins. Depending on which drug or fertility treatment is used, your odds of conceiving twins while taking fertility drugs ranges between 5 and 30 percent. Medications like Clomid and fertility procedures like IUI and IVF are responsible for the majority of twin births in the United States. But fertility drugs aren't the only cause for dizygotic twins. Your odds of conceiving twins may be higher if: The mother is 30 years of age or older The mother is taller than average   You have a family history of twins You're overweight You're African-American Here is more information on your odds of conceiving twins: What Increases Your Chances for Twins Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? What Location and Ethnicity Has to Do With Your Odds for Twins The odds of twins is highly affected by ethnicity and even location.         Those of African ethnicity are most likely to have twins, while Asians are least likely. Europeans fall into the mid-range. However, even within these broad categories, there can be a lot of differentiation. For example... In the United States, the twinning rates in 2003 were found to be 15.8 per 1,000 pregnancies. For Caucasian Americans, the rate was 15.7 per 1,000, while for black Americans, it was higher at 17.2 per 1,000. In Europe, the overall twinning rate in 2003 was 16.4 per 1,000 births. In Luxembourg and Portugal, the twinning rate was 11 in 1,000. Compare that to the twinning rates in Denmark, Greece, and the Netherlands where it was 20 per 1,000 births—almost twice as high. Nigeria has an overall high twinning rate, with an overall dizygotic twinning rate of 40 per 1,000 births. Still, variations are found in different regions. In Western and Eastern Nigeria, twinning rates were between 33 to 66.5 per 1,000 births. In Nothern Nigeria, rates were 19.4 per 1,000 for specific groups. These variations are found for dizygotic twins. But these differences by region and race are not found for monozygotic twins, or identical twins. The rate of identical twins is pretty much constant across all regions, occurring in approximately 4 per 1,000 pregnancies.          Dizygotic Twins and Gender Will you have boy-girl twins, boy-boy twins, or girl-girl twins? Here are your odds: Boy-girl twins are the most common kind of dizygotic twins, occurring 50 percent of the time. Girl-girl twins are the second most common occurrence. Boy-boy twins are the least common. Dizygotic Twins and Their Amniotic Sacs and Placentas Dizygotic twins typically have separate amniotic sacs and placentas. This is known as being dichorionic-diamniotic. (Sometimes called Di-Di for short.) This is the most common set-up for dizygotic twins. Di-Di twins also have the lowest pregnancy risks. Twin Pregnancy Risks for the Mother and Babies  There are rare instances of dizygotic twins who share one placenta. In this case, each has his or her own amniotic sac. This is referred to as monochorionic-diamniotic (Mo-Di for short). The risks are higher for twins sharing a placenta, due to the risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . The pregnancy may be monitored more closely. Because two placentas can fuse over time, it can be difficult to identify via ultrasound whether there are two placentas or one later in the pregnancy. For this reason, your doctor may send you for an ultrasound near the end of the first trimester, when it’s still possible to see the separation of two placentas. Reducing Your Risk of Twins When Using Fertility Treatments There has been an increase in dizygotic twinning in developed countries across the world, and this in large part occurred because of fertility treatment use. For a few decades, twin rates went up and up, until the year 2000, when rates finally started to drop slightly. They reached a peak and started to go down because as fertility treatment technology has advanced, reproductive specialists have found ways to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies. The goal of infertility treatment should always be one healthy baby, one at a time. It's not possible to completely eliminate the risk of twins during fertility treatment, but a few options are available. Using lowest effective dose for fertility treatments : The highest risk for twins occurs during injectable fertility drug use (gonadotropins) along with timed sexual intercourse or insemination. There is no control over how many follicles may develop or become fertilized. However, when doctors use just enough fertility medication to stimulate just one or two follicles, the odds of multiples can be reduced. Of course, if there are two follicles, the risk for twins is higher than if there is just one follicle. Also, if more than one—or a few to several—follicle develop, the doctor can "cancel" the cycle and ask the couple not to have sexual intercourse. Single embryo transfer IVF (SET-IVF) : With in vitro fertilization, the doctor can control how many embryos are transferred back to the uterus. When IVF was newer and less effective, transferring two to four embryos at a time wasn't uncommon. The hope was that at least one will "stick." But sometimes, more than one "stuck." Now, with young and good prognosis patients, single embryo transfer is an option. In this case, only one good quality embryo is transferred. There is still a very low risk of identical twinning. But the higher risk of dizygotic twinning is eliminated. Frozen embryo transfer IVF (FET-IVF) : Improvements in cryopreservation make single embryo transfer a viable option. Ideally, a couple will have more than just one good quality embryo. But what happens to the embryos not transferred? With FET-IVF, the "extra" embryos can be frozen for now. Then, if pregnancy doesn't occur, a future FET-IVF cycle can be tried. If pregnancy does occur with the first embryo transferred, you can keep the cryopreserved embryos "on ice" for future siblings, or they can be donated to another couple or to scientific research. Trizygotic Triplets and Quadrazygotic Quadruplets If three eggs are fertilized by three separate sperm, this may result in trizygotic triplets . If four eggs are fertilized by four separate sperm, you may get quadrazygotic quadruplets. It is also possible for a mother pregnant with high-order multiples to have a combination of twins. For example, triplets may start as nonidentical twins (or dizygotic twins). Then, one of those zygotes splits, leading to a set of identical twins (or monozygotic twins). Altogether, you would have two identical twins and one non-identical twin making up the set of triplets. If you find this hard to understand, try this. Take two pens, one red and one black. Draw a smiley face with the red pen, with a little baby hair on top. Draw another smiley face with the black pen. Now, from the black pen face, draw two lines down and out, each going to a separate new smiley face. In one big circle, draw a line around one of the red faces and two of the black faces. Those are the triplets -- two identical twins (black pen) and one "sibling" twin (red pen). However, the majority of high-order multiples are made up of non-identical twins.

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

garymilner/E+/Getty Images       More in Fertility Challenges        Treatment     Clomid     IVF       Causes & Concerns     Diagnosis & Testing     Coping and Moving Forward        Gonadotropins are fertility drugs that contain follicle stimulation hormone (FSH) , luteinizing hormone (LH) or a combination of the two. These drugs are used to stimulate ovulation. Brand names that may be familiar to you include Gonal-F, Follistim, Ovidrel, Menopur, and Luveris. (More names below.) Gonadotropins are known informally as injectables.         They are administered by injection only. (This is different from fertility drugs like Clomid and letrozole , which are pills you take by mouth.) The naturally occurring hormones in the body FSH and LH are also known as gonadotropins. They play a pivotal role in ovulation . How Do They Work? To better understand how gonadotropins work, you should first understand how the female reproductive system works. Read an easy to understand, step-by-step explanation of the female reproductive cycle here. If you don't have time for that, here's a super quick recap! Normally, your pituitary gland produces FSH and LH at the beginning of your menstrual cycle. The FSH is sent out into the body. LH is stored in the pituitary gland until just before ovulation. FSH tells the follicles in your ovaries to wake up and grow. FSH stands for "follicle stimulating hormone." Makes perfect sense, given it stimulates the follicles !   Gonadotropin fertility drugs, that are FSH or FSH along with LH, act similarly. They tell the follicles on your ovaries to grow and develop. LH typically peaks just before ovulation during a natural cycle and helps any mature eggs to go through one last growth spurt and release. In other words, ovulate!         During treatment with gonadotropins, you may be given either an injection of rLH or, more commonly, hCG . This acts like the natural LH spike and will trigger ovulation. What to Expect Gonadotropins may be used on their own. They may also be used as part of an IUI treatment or IVF treatment cycle. Below is an explanation of how they may be used on their own. When you get your next period, you'll call your doctor. You'll then have some blood work and an ultrasound. This is to make sure there are no complications or reasons you can't be treated in this cycle. (For example, to ensure you aren't pregnant and don't have a benign ovarian cyst .) Your doctor will likely start you off with 75 to 150 IU of the gonadotropin medication. Depending on which gonadotropin is prescribed, you'll need to give yourself injections just below the skin (subcutaneously) or into the muscle (intramuscularly). Ask your doctor or nurse to demonstrate how to safely perform the injections. They will likely do this without you asking. How to Give Yourself a Subcutaneous Injection How to Give Yourself an IM Injection Over the next several days, your hormone levels, specifically estradiol , and the follicles on your ovaries will be closely monitored.         This monitoring happens via blood work and ultrasound every few days. How often? That will depend on your doctor's protocol, how you're responding to the drugs, and how close you are to ovulation. Your medications may be adjusted up or down depending on the ultrasound and hormone results. The goal is to stimulate the ovaries enough to produce one good egg, but not to overstimulate them. Other stimulation can increase your risks of a multiple pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). When your hormone levels and follicle size indicate ovulation is close, your doctor may order an injection of hCG.  This is also known as the " trigger shot ." It triggers ovulation to occur approximately 36 hours later. Your doctor should also tell you which days to have intercourse, so you can"catch" the egg and get pregnant! How to Cope with Doctor Prescribed Conception Sex During Treatment Once ovulation occurs, you may then start taking progesterone . Not everyone will need this, however. Your hormone levels will continue to be monitored, though less frequently. You'll take a pregnancy test at the end of the cycle to determine if treatment was successful. Sometimes, treatment may be canceled in the middle. This may occur before the trigger shot or even earlier. The most common reason for cycle cancellation is your doctor suspects the ovaries have been hyperstimulated. Stopping the medications can avoid a serious case of OHSS and high-order multiples. Your doctor may also tell you to refrain from intercourse. As difficult as it is to hear this, it's very important you follow your doctor's instructions. Pregnancy can increase the chances of a high-order pregnancy, which puts you and your babies at risk. Also, if you develop OHSS, pregnancy can complicate your recovery. Different Types There are two basic types of gonadotropins: recombinant gonadotropins and urinary-extracted gonadotropins. Recombinant gonadotropins are created in a laboratory using recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant FSH gonadotropins on the market include Gonal-F and Follistim. Currently, Luveris is the only recombinant LH gonadotropin available. Urinary-extracted gonadotropins are extracted and purified from the urine of postmenopausal women. (Their urine is naturally high in FSH.) They include human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), purified FSH and highly purified FSH. Purified urine-extracted FSH gonadotropins include Bravelle and Fertinex. Human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) contains FSH and LH. It includes medications like Humegon, Menogon, Pergonal and Repronex. Menopur is a highly purified hMG. A related drug, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often part of fertility treatment with gonadotropin injections . You may know hCG as the pregnancy hormone , but it also happens to be molecularly similar to LH. In a natural cycle, LH triggers ovulation . As part of fertility treatment , an injection of hCG may be used to trigger ovulation. Ovidrel, Novarel, Pregnyl and Profasi are brand names for hCG injectables. Associated Risks Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially serious complication of gonadotropin therapy. Mild OHSS occurs in 10% to 20% of women taking gonadotropins. Serious OHSS occurs 1% of the time. Serious OHSS can be deadly if ignored or not treated properly. It's important you are familiar with the symptoms. OHSS Symptoms and Treatment Another possible risk factor of gonadotropin therapy is a multiple pregnancy. Some studies have found that up to 30% of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins are twins or more. (This is compared to just 1% to 2% of naturally conceived pregnancies.) Most multiple pregnancies with gonadotropins are twins. Up to 5% are triplets or more. Multiple pregnancies , including twin pregnancies , are risky for the mother and the babies. Close monitoring of a treatment cycle can help prevent a multiple pregnancy. Many doctors will cancel if more than three follicles develop or if estradiol levels are very high. Some studies have been able to get the rate of multiples pregnancies as low as 5%. They have done this by starting at a low dose, using slow increases only when necessary and close monitoring. Twin Pregnancy Risks Should I Get Pregnant with Twins on Purpose? Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? The risk of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage is higher with gonadotropin-conceived pregnancies. Less than 1% of women taking gonadotropins will experience adnexal torsion, or ovarian twisting. This is when the ovary twists on itself and cuts off its own blood supply. Surgery is necessary to untwist or possibly remove the affected ovary. Your risk of pregnancy complications -- like pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and placental abruption -- may be slightly increased as compared to a naturally conceived pregnancy. Whether this is caused by the gonadotropins or the infertility is unclear. Because gonadotropins are injectable medications, you may also experience soreness near the injection sites. If you suspect an infection, be sure to alert your doctor right away. Side Effects and Risks of Gonadotropins What Are the Success Rates? Your potential for pregnancy success with gonadotropins will depend on a variety of factors, including your age and the cause of infertility. A 2011 study by The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine looked at 1,400 gonadotropin treatment cycles. The overall pregnancy rate was 12%, with the live birth rate about 7.7%. Younger patients had higher live birth rates. In this study, by canceling the cycle if three or more dominant follicles developed or estradiol levels were higher than 1500 pg/ml, they were able to keep the multiple pregnancy rate a low 2.6%. Older studies have found higher pregnancy rates with gonadotropins than this one. However, it's possible the higher success rate came at the expense of higher risk for OHSS and multiple pregnancy. Cost of Treatment Gonadotropin treatment that is not an IUI or IVF cycle can cost anywhere between $500 to $5,000. The higher price takes into account blood work and ultrasound monitoring. Also, the price varies because different women will need different amounts of drugs. Your insurance company may pay for part of treatment. Or, they may pay for all of it... or none of it. You may need to pay your fertility clinic in full first. Then, you may need to file for a refund from your insurance yourself, or the clinic may handle the insurance claims for you. Be sure to clarify all of this with your fertility clinic before you start treatment. You don't want to be surprised by a high bill at the end.

Multiples in pregnancy Twins triplets quads identical and fraternal            Home : Ovulation Planner : Duedate : Baby Names : Week by Week : Site Map :             Types of Multiples in pregnancy   A pregnancy of two or more fetuses is called a multiple pregnancy. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

Share                  In this article   How common are twins or more?  Are twins more common than they used to be?  How likely is it I'll have more than one baby after fertility treatment?  What may increase my chances of having twins naturally?  How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins?    How common are twins or more? A lot depends on whether you conceived your twins naturally, or with the help of fertility treatment.  After natural conception , just over one per cent of pregnancies are twins (NCCWCH 2013, NHS 2014) .  For babies born as a result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), where two embryos are put back in the mum's womb (uterus), 24 per cent of births result in twins or triplets (HFEA 2014) . This is about 20 times higher than the rate for natural conception.  Overall, twins , triplets and more account for about three per cent of babies who are born in the UK (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . Are twins more common than they used to be? Yes. The number of twins and triplets born in the UK has increased a lot in the past three decades (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . This increase is mainly because more couples are using fertility treatments to conceive.  Another factor is that women are having babies later in life (NHS 2014) . Older mums have a higher chance of conceiving twins (NHS 2014) . How likely is it I'll have more than one baby after fertility treatment? IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can make it much more likely that you'll conceive multiples than if you'd conceived naturally, but only if you have two embryos transferred (HFEA 2014) .  Fertility clinics have reduced the number of cases where they transfer more than one embryo to a mum receiving treatment. This is because the regulating body, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), now encourages the transfer of one embyro at a time (HFEA 2015) . This is called elective single embryo transfer (eSET).  However, particularly for women aged 35 or over, IVF still often involves introducing two embryos into a woman's womb (HFEA 2015) , raising the chance of twins about 20 times.  Some fertility drugs such as clomifene or gonadotrophins stimulate the ovaries. This increases the chance that several eggs will be released in one go. About eight per cent of women who take the fertility drug clomifene have a multiple pregnancy, usually twins (EMC 2014) .  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have been unsuccessful at getting pregnant with clomifene, have a 36 per cent chance of multiple pregnancy if they take gonadotrophins (NCCWCH 2013) . What may increase my chances of having twins naturally? The chances of having twins increases if you are 35 or older (NHS 2014, Utting and Bewley 2011) . As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which can trigger the ovaries to release several eggs in a single month.  Non-identical twins tend to run in families . This is probably because of an inherited tendency to release more than one egg that then causes this type of twinning. So if you're female and non-identical twins run in your side of the family, you're more likely to have them yourself (NHS 2014) .  If you are a black woman, especially if you are of Central African descent, you're also slightly more likely to have twins (NHS 2014, Smits and Monden 2011) . How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins? The likelihood of you having identical twins is about one in 350 to 400 (NHS 2014) . About a third of twins are identical (McAslan Fraser 2012) .  Whether or not you conceive identical twins seems to be entirely down to chance. Identical twins develop when one fertilised egg divides into two. Nobody knows what causes an egg to split and become identical twins (NHS 2014) .  If you think you might be expecting twins, find out how soon you'll know for sure .

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Nick Martin and Grant Montgomery, senior research fellows at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research in Brisbane, Australia, specialize in twin studies. They supply the following answer.  There is no doubt that twinning seems to run in some families. Closer investigation reveals that this is mainly confined to nonidentical, or fraternal (dizygotic - DZ) twins, although there are a few rare families with extraordinary numbers of identical (monozygotic - MZ) twins. Furthermore, the increased chance of twinning seems to be entirely a property of the mother, not the father. Of course, there are counter examples to all these rules, and there are even families with large numbers of both identical and fraternal twins. At the moment it is not clear whether these just occur by chance and we get to hear about them due to reporting bias (they always make great front page stories) or whether they represent some new biological mechanism. The strongest clues we have--that it is confined to fraternal twinning and females--suggest that the primary cause is an increased risk of multiple ovulation, in which a woman releases two or more eggs in a given menstrual cycle rather than the normal one. We tested this by ultrasound scanning of ovaries just before ovulation in mothers who had previously given birth to two sets of fraternal twins (MODZTs). Such women showed a much higher rate of multiple ovulation than control women did. The maturation and release of one or more eggs is controlled by several reproductive hormones, including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and inhibins. We checked the level of these hormones in MODZTs and controls at different parts of the menstrual cycle and showed that there were some abnormalities, although these were not very consistent. Perhaps the most intriguing finding is Dutch evidence that MODZTs release FSH in more frequent pulses than normal women. The best evidence for twinning genes comes from sheep, where mutations in two genes increase twinning by altering the response of the ovary to FSH. Currently, we are collecting DNA from pairs of sisters who have both had fraternal twins, because these will enable us to use genetic linkage analysis to locate the genes responsible for familial fraternal twinning. Once we have found them, and understood the mechanisms by which they work, we may well be able to predict which particular women have a greater chance of having twins. Meanwhile, the best way of increasing your chances of having fraternal twins if you are female is to have a mother, a sister, or an aunt (on either your mother's or father's side) who has had fraternal twins. If you are male, then marry a woman who fits this description because it seems that the father has no influence on the chance of twins, although he can pass the tendency to his daughters. Another major factor is maternal age; a woman who gives birth at 37 is four times more likely to have fraternal twins than at age 18, although she is also more likely to be unable to conceive, since many women's ovaries are already starting to fail at that age. The third major risk factor is race; West Africans are ten times more likely to have fraternal twins than Chinese or Japanese, with Caucasians intermediate. Some increased chance is also seen in African-Americans. Interestingly, neither maternal age nor race seems to influence identical twinning, which is almost universally constant at about four per 1000 births. Finally, all the above only applies to spontaneous, or natural, births. The introduction of assisted reproduction techniques (ART), particularly ovarian stimulation, has seen a dramatic rise in the number of twin and higher multiple births. They also slightly increase the chance of having identical twins, which suggests that there may be some connection between the two types of twinning.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

When your twins are a boy and girl pair, the answer is easy, but people don't always realize it. Many think that being identical twins refers to how twins look and not how they form. Take a look at the biology that determines the sex combinations that are possible with identical and fraternal twins. Can Boy/Girl Twins Be Identical? The short answer is no.         They are always fraternal. The terms identical and fraternal don't describe what the twins look like, but actually how they form. Identical ( monozygotic ) twins are always of the same sex because they form from a single zygote (fertilized egg) that contains either male (XY) or female (XX) sex chromosomes. Therefore, boy/girl twins are always fraternal or ( dizygotic ); they can only form from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two separate sperm. Fraternal twins can be either two girls, two boys, or one of each. These are the possible sex combinations: Two girl twins can be either identical or fraternal (monozygotic or dizygotic). Two boy twins can be either identical or fraternal (monozygotic or dizygotic). A set of boy/girl twins can only be fraternal (dizygotic). Boy/girl twins cannot be identical (monozygotic). Identical Twins Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two.   Before it splits, it is either male or female. After it splits, there are either two males or two females. Both parts of the fertilized egg implant in the uterus and each produces one of the twins. Identical twins have the same genetic origin. No direct cause of monozygotic twinning has been determined; it is not hereditary.         Monozygotic twins represent about one-third of all twins. They may look remarkably similar, and it may be difficult to tell them apart . Fraternal Twins Fraternal twins are two genetically unique individuals as they come from two separate eggs that are fertilized by separate sperm. The resulting egg/sperm combination can be male or female. The result is either two male twins, two female twins, or one male and one female. The genetic similarity between fraternal twins is the same as any two siblings (about 50 percent if they have the same mother and father). They may look alike, or not, just like any sisters and brothers. Fraternal twins are the most common form of twins, representing about two-thirds of all twins. Dizygotic twinning can be hereditary and run in families . Also, most twins and multiples that result from fertility enhancing treatments, such as drugs or procedures like in-vitro fertilization, are dizygotic rather than monozygotic. Exception to the Twin Sex Rule Every rule has exceptions, of course. In this case, they are extremely rare exceptions, and it's not likely that the average person would ever encounter twins in this situation. Note that there have been a few reported cases of a genetic mutation in monozygotic male twins.         For some reason, after the zygote splits, one twin loses a Y chromosome and develops as a female. The female twin would have Turner syndrome, characterized by short stature and lack of ovarian development. It's extremely rare; less than 10 cases have been confirmed. Given the odds, it's safe to assume that 99.9 percent of all boy/girl twins are fraternal. Twins That Are Genetically Dissimilar While identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and share the same DNA combination, there are more possibilities for fraternal twins. Besides being the offspring of two sperm and egg combinations, they may have different genetic donors.  Here are the different combinations: Fraternal twins could be produced when eggs from one woman are fertilized by sperm from two different men. This can happen with unassisted conception and with in-vitro fertilization. In this case, the twins would be half-siblings. A woman may carry twins conceived in-vitro with donor eggs, which could come from two different women. If they are fertilized by sperm from the same man, the twins would be half-siblings. Donor eggs from two different women could be fertilized by sperm from two different men. In this case, the twins may have no shared DNA unless the sperm and egg donors were related. They would be similar to step-siblings. A Word From Verywell You are likely to have to answer the same questions about your twins repeatedly. Armed with a few facts about twins, you'll be able just to grin and bear it or enlighten the curious about the biology of twins. Sources: Turner Syndrome .

What may increase my chances of having twins naturally?  How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins?    How common are twins or more? A lot depends on whether you conceived your twins naturally, or with the help of fertility treatment.  After natural conception , just over one per cent of pregnancies are twins (NCCWCH 2013, NHS 2014) .  For babies born as a result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), where two embryos are put back in the mum's womb (uterus), 24 per cent of births result in twins or triplets (HFEA 2014) . This is about 20 times higher than the rate for natural conception.  Overall, twins , triplets and more account for about three per cent of babies who are born in the UK (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . Are twins more common than they used to be? Yes. The number of twins and triplets born in the UK has increased a lot in the past three decades (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . This increase is mainly because more couples are using fertility treatments to conceive.  Another factor is that women are having babies later in life (NHS 2014) . Older mums have a higher chance of conceiving twins (NHS 2014) . How likely is it I'll have more than one baby after fertility treatment? IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can make it much more likely that you'll conceive multiples than if you'd conceived naturally, but only if you have two embryos transferred (HFEA 2014) .  Fertility clinics have reduced the number of cases where they transfer more than one embryo to a mum receiving treatment. This is because the regulating body, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), now encourages the transfer of one embyro at a time (HFEA 2015) . This is called elective single embryo transfer (eSET).  However, particularly for women aged 35 or over, IVF still often involves introducing two embryos into a woman's womb (HFEA 2015) , raising the chance of twins about 20 times.  Some fertility drugs such as clomifene or gonadotrophins stimulate the ovaries. This increases the chance that several eggs will be released in one go. About eight per cent of women who take the fertility drug clomifene have a multiple pregnancy, usually twins (EMC 2014) .  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have been unsuccessful at getting pregnant with clomifene, have a 36 per cent chance of multiple pregnancy if they take gonadotrophins (NCCWCH 2013) . What may increase my chances of having twins naturally? The chances of having twins increases if you are 35 or older (NHS 2014, Utting and Bewley 2011) . As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which can trigger the ovaries to release several eggs in a single month.  Non-identical twins tend to run in families . This is probably because of an inherited tendency to release more than one egg that then causes this type of twinning. So if you're female and non-identical twins run in your side of the family, you're more likely to have them yourself (NHS 2014) .  If you are a black woman, especially if you are of Central African descent, you're also slightly more likely to have twins (NHS 2014, Smits and Monden 2011) . How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins? The likelihood of you having identical twins is about one in 350 to 400 (NHS 2014) . About a third of twins are identical (McAslan Fraser 2012) .  Whether or not you conceive identical twins seems to be entirely down to chance. Identical twins develop when one fertilised egg divides into two. Nobody knows what causes an egg to split and become identical twins (NHS 2014) .  If you think you might be expecting twins, find out how soon you'll know for sure .

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

So… the odds aren’t exactly with you. Or are they? Turns out, there are a number of factors that can affect your odds of getting pregnant with multiples and having twin babies. These include your age, diet, number of pregnancies you’ve had, ethnicity, location, body type, and more. So what are your chancing of having twins or multiples? Take our just-for-fun quiz to find out instantly!  1. Do you have fraternal twins in your family?  Not that I know of  Yes, on my dad’s side  Yes, on my mom’s side  Yes, more than one set on my mom’s side 2. Are you overweight and/or taller than average?  Yes  No 3. What is your ethnicity?  Nigerian  African  Caucasian  Hispanic or Asian  Other 4. Where do you live?  Nigeria  Central Africa  North America or Europe  Latin America or Asia  Other 5. Do you eat a high fat diet?  Yep, full fat pastured yogurt, coconut oil, and pastured bacon  Yes, but it mostly comes from conventional animal products  I try to limit my consumption of fat 6. Do you frequently eat large amounts of phytoestrogen foods such as soy, tempeh, flax, sesame seeds, oats, barley, dried beans, lentils, yams, alfalfa, and mung beans?  Yes, I eat large servings of those foods daily  Sure, but not daily  No, I hardly ever eat those foods 7. How old are you?  Under 35  35-39  Over 40 8. How many full-term pregnancies have you had (including your current pregnancy)?  This is my first  2  3  4+ 9. Did you use fertility treatments to conceive?  Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

Around 90% of all multiples are made up of twins; the remaining 10% is with triplets, quadruplets and very occasionally   quintuplets and more. In recent years there has been a big increase in the numbers of twins being born. This is due to advancing maternal age, assisted reproduction technology, as well as the use of fertility drugs.  Importantly, better neonatal care has meant that premature twins have a better chance of survival than ever before.  There are two types of twins – identical or monozygotic (one egg), and non-identical or dizygotic (two eggs) twins. Other names for identical twins are non-fraternal twins, and non-identical twins are sometimes called fraternal twins.  It is thought that twin pregnancies are far more common than we are aware of – perhaps as many as 5% of all pregnancies at 12 weeks involve a twin. Though not all will continue to develop as they need to in order to form two babies. Most commonly, this is thought to be due to a major interruption occurring with healthy cell maturation and division.  How do identical twins happen?  Identical twins form when one egg has been fertilised by one sperm and the zygote splits into two.  This happens at the very earliest stage of development, when the zygote is no more than a cluster of a few cells.  Dividing this early in conception means that each baby has exactly the same genetic information as the other.  Identical twins can also occur when one a woman has undergone fertility assistance and has had one fertilised egg returned to her uterus. If this egg then splits into two, an identical twin pregnancy can result.  Identical twins are not dependent on race, country or ethnicity. The odds of having identical twins are the same for every couple, in every pregnancy, wherever they live in the world.  Around one in every three sets of twins born is identical, and the remaining 2/3 is of the non-identical variety.  What increases the odds of having identical twins?   Luck needs to be on your side.  Identical twins do not run in families and can happen for any couple with any pregnancy.  Non-identical twins are influenced by genetics; women whose mothers or grandmothers had non-identical twins do have more chance of having non-identical twins themselves.  But identical twins are just random.  Some families do seem to have a higher than average number of identical twins. Though this can only be contributed to luck, coincidence and chance rather than any familial genetic tendency.   How do non-identical twins happen?  Non-identical twins are uniquely separate individuals who just happen to be gestating at the same time and place as each other. Non-identical twins form from two completely separate eggs which are fertilised by two completely separate sperm. These fraternal twins are no more alike than any other siblings in a family with the same biological mother and father.  Because identical twins share the same genes, they are always the same gender. But non-identical twins may be the same gender or the opposite because they only share 50% of the same genetic coding.  Some people still believe that the incidence of having twins skips a generation but this is not true.  What increases the odds of having non-identical twins?   Advancing maternal age.  Women who are aged in their 30’s and 40’s have significantly higher chances of conceiving with twins.  Younger women, especially those aged in their 20’s, do not have as much chance.  Having assisted reproductive technology, in particular taking medication which increases ovulation. This makes perfect sense because the more eggs which are supported towards maturity each month, and which are then released, means the more that are available to be fertilised.  The more pregnancies a woman has already had, the higher her chances of conceiving with non-identical twins.  If a woman is a fraternal-non-identical twin herself, if she has siblings who are fraternal twins or her mother/grandmother had fraternal twins, then she is more likely to as well.  Race – Black African women are more likely to have twins than women from any other ethnic descent.   What causes the fertilised egg to separate into two?  The exact reason why this happens is still a mystery. Over the years there has been a lot of research and time invested into finding out why some zygotes split into two and others don’t.  But the truth is we still do not know why.  In reality, the splitting of one fertilised egg is a malformation of the natural processes of conception.  When are identical twins actually formed?  Though all identical twins are formed very early in pregnancy, there is some variation in exactly how early the fertilised egg splits into two.  This can happen at the two cell stage on Day 2, the early blastocyst stage on Day 4, or in the late blastocyst stage on Day 6.  The stage when the egg splits into two will determine where the fertilised eggs will implant in the uterine wall.  Once the embryo gets to the 8 cells stage the foetal DNA takes over.  The stage at which the egg splits will also determine if the babies have their own amniotic membranes and placenta or if they share. Essentially, the earlier the egg splits, the more independent each twin will be by having their own amnion, chorion and placenta.  Early splitting also means that the twins are perhaps less identical than those who separate at the late blastocyst stage. Around a quarter of all identical twins are said to be mirror images of each other. This means that the left side of one twin exactly matches the right side of the other. How amazing is that!  Although identical twins share the same DNA and genetic coding, they are still unique little individuals. Small differences separate them and although at birth they can appear like little clones of each other, they are far from it. As identical twins grow, their unique qualities (particularly in relation to their personalities) become more apparent. The environment in which they are raised as well as their own personalities help to shape the adults they will become. This is exactly the same as any other baby born the world over.  How will I know if I’ve conceived with twins?  Because the splitting of the zygote occurs so early in pregnancy, mothers are not initially aware they have conceived with twins. It’s not until twins may be suspected because of the intensity of pregnancy symptoms, or if they have been diagnosed through ultrasound, that a couple may know they are expecting twins.  Is it obvious at birth that twins are identical?  Even at birth it can be difficult to be sure if twins are identical or non-identical. Identical twins can still be born with their own set of membranes and this is not a marker for them to be non-identical. It’s not always clear simply by looking or examining the twins to know if they are identical or not.  The only way to be 100% sure is to do DNA testing on each twin and see what genetic information they share. This can be done in the early neonatal period by taking a swab of tissue from inside each baby’s cheek. This is painless and non-invasive.  The other way to check is to take a blood test and do blood grouping. Identical twins will share the same genetic information so the same genetic markers can be identified. Whereas non-identical twins can be very different; much the same as any other siblings with the same parents. They share around half the same genetic information and traits with each other.  What are the risks of having identical twins?   If the identical twins share a placenta they are at a higher risk of having twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This often results in one twin gaining more nourishment than the other, and having a higher birth weight as a result.  Umbilical cord entanglement and compression if the twins share an amniotic sac. Purely because of the crowded conditions which occur in the mother’s uterus. With identical and non-identical twins, there is an increased risk of pregnancy and birth complications. There is also an increased likelihood of prematurity and associated problems.

What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

Dizygotic twins are also known as fraternal or non-identical twins. They are the most common type of twins. Unlike monozygotic twins (also known as identical twins), dizygotic twins do not share the same genes. Monozygotic twins share 100 percent of each other genes. Dizygotic twins share only 50 percent.         This is the same genetic similarity found between siblings conceived and born at different times. Why Might Someone Conceive Dizygotic Twins? Dizygotic twins may occur if two or more oocytes (eggs) are released in one cycle. If each is fertilized, dizygotic twins may result. During IVF treatment , if two or more embryos are transferred, you may also get pregnant with twins (or more.) Fertility drugs are a common cause of dizygotic twins. Depending on which drug or fertility treatment is used, your odds of conceiving twins while taking fertility drugs ranges between 5 and 30 percent. Medications like Clomid and fertility procedures like IUI and IVF are responsible for the majority of twin births in the United States. But fertility drugs aren't the only cause for dizygotic twins. Your odds of conceiving twins may be higher if: The mother is 30 years of age or older The mother is taller than average   You have a family history of twins You're overweight You're African-American Here is more information on your odds of conceiving twins: What Increases Your Chances for Twins Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? What Location and Ethnicity Has to Do With Your Odds for Twins The odds of twins is highly affected by ethnicity and even location.         Those of African ethnicity are most likely to have twins, while Asians are least likely. Europeans fall into the mid-range. However, even within these broad categories, there can be a lot of differentiation. For example... In the United States, the twinning rates in 2003 were found to be 15.8 per 1,000 pregnancies. For Caucasian Americans, the rate was 15.7 per 1,000, while for black Americans, it was higher at 17.2 per 1,000. In Europe, the overall twinning rate in 2003 was 16.4 per 1,000 births. In Luxembourg and Portugal, the twinning rate was 11 in 1,000. Compare that to the twinning rates in Denmark, Greece, and the Netherlands where it was 20 per 1,000 births—almost twice as high. Nigeria has an overall high twinning rate, with an overall dizygotic twinning rate of 40 per 1,000 births. Still, variations are found in different regions. In Western and Eastern Nigeria, twinning rates were between 33 to 66.5 per 1,000 births. In Nothern Nigeria, rates were 19.4 per 1,000 for specific groups. These variations are found for dizygotic twins. But these differences by region and race are not found for monozygotic twins, or identical twins. The rate of identical twins is pretty much constant across all regions, occurring in approximately 4 per 1,000 pregnancies.          Dizygotic Twins and Gender Will you have boy-girl twins, boy-boy twins, or girl-girl twins? Here are your odds: Boy-girl twins are the most common kind of dizygotic twins, occurring 50 percent of the time. Girl-girl twins are the second most common occurrence. Boy-boy twins are the least common. Dizygotic Twins and Their Amniotic Sacs and Placentas Dizygotic twins typically have separate amniotic sacs and placentas. This is known as being dichorionic-diamniotic. (Sometimes called Di-Di for short.) This is the most common set-up for dizygotic twins. Di-Di twins also have the lowest pregnancy risks. Twin Pregnancy Risks for the Mother and Babies  There are rare instances of dizygotic twins who share one placenta. In this case, each has his or her own amniotic sac. This is referred to as monochorionic-diamniotic (Mo-Di for short). The risks are higher for twins sharing a placenta, due to the risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . The pregnancy may be monitored more closely. Because two placentas can fuse over time, it can be difficult to identify via ultrasound whether there are two placentas or one later in the pregnancy. For this reason, your doctor may send you for an ultrasound near the end of the first trimester, when it’s still possible to see the separation of two placentas. Reducing Your Risk of Twins When Using Fertility Treatments There has been an increase in dizygotic twinning in developed countries across the world, and this in large part occurred because of fertility treatment use. For a few decades, twin rates went up and up, until the year 2000, when rates finally started to drop slightly. They reached a peak and started to go down because as fertility treatment technology has advanced, reproductive specialists have found ways to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies. The goal of infertility treatment should always be one healthy baby, one at a time. It's not possible to completely eliminate the risk of twins during fertility treatment, but a few options are available. Using lowest effective dose for fertility treatments : The highest risk for twins occurs during injectable fertility drug use (gonadotropins) along with timed sexual intercourse or insemination. There is no control over how many follicles may develop or become fertilized. However, when doctors use just enough fertility medication to stimulate just one or two follicles, the odds of multiples can be reduced. Of course, if there are two follicles, the risk for twins is higher than if there is just one follicle. Also, if more than one—or a few to several—follicle develop, the doctor can "cancel" the cycle and ask the couple not to have sexual intercourse. Single embryo transfer IVF (SET-IVF) : With in vitro fertilization, the doctor can control how many embryos are transferred back to the uterus. When IVF was newer and less effective, transferring two to four embryos at a time wasn't uncommon. The hope was that at least one will "stick." But sometimes, more than one "stuck." Now, with young and good prognosis patients, single embryo transfer is an option. In this case, only one good quality embryo is transferred. There is still a very low risk of identical twinning. But the higher risk of dizygotic twinning is eliminated. Frozen embryo transfer IVF (FET-IVF) : Improvements in cryopreservation make single embryo transfer a viable option. Ideally, a couple will have more than just one good quality embryo. But what happens to the embryos not transferred? With FET-IVF, the "extra" embryos can be frozen for now. Then, if pregnancy doesn't occur, a future FET-IVF cycle can be tried. If pregnancy does occur with the first embryo transferred, you can keep the cryopreserved embryos "on ice" for future siblings, or they can be donated to another couple or to scientific research. Trizygotic Triplets and Quadrazygotic Quadruplets If three eggs are fertilized by three separate sperm, this may result in trizygotic triplets . If four eggs are fertilized by four separate sperm, you may get quadrazygotic quadruplets. It is also possible for a mother pregnant with high-order multiples to have a combination of twins. For example, triplets may start as nonidentical twins (or dizygotic twins). Then, one of those zygotes splits, leading to a set of identical twins (or monozygotic twins). Altogether, you would have two identical twins and one non-identical twin making up the set of triplets. If you find this hard to understand, try this. Take two pens, one red and one black. Draw a smiley face with the red pen, with a little baby hair on top. Draw another smiley face with the black pen. Now, from the black pen face, draw two lines down and out, each going to a separate new smiley face. In one big circle, draw a line around one of the red faces and two of the black faces. Those are the triplets -- two identical twins (black pen) and one "sibling" twin (red pen). However, the majority of high-order multiples are made up of non-identical twins.

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

These drugs are used to stimulate ovulation. Brand names that may be familiar to you include Gonal-F, Follistim, Ovidrel, Menopur, and Luveris. (More names below.) Gonadotropins are known informally as injectables.         They are administered by injection only. (This is different from fertility drugs like Clomid and letrozole , which are pills you take by mouth.) The naturally occurring hormones in the body FSH and LH are also known as gonadotropins. They play a pivotal role in ovulation . How Do They Work? To better understand how gonadotropins work, you should first understand how the female reproductive system works. Read an easy to understand, step-by-step explanation of the female reproductive cycle here. If you don't have time for that, here's a super quick recap! Normally, your pituitary gland produces FSH and LH at the beginning of your menstrual cycle. The FSH is sent out into the body. LH is stored in the pituitary gland until just before ovulation. FSH tells the follicles in your ovaries to wake up and grow. FSH stands for "follicle stimulating hormone." Makes perfect sense, given it stimulates the follicles !   Gonadotropin fertility drugs, that are FSH or FSH along with LH, act similarly. They tell the follicles on your ovaries to grow and develop. LH typically peaks just before ovulation during a natural cycle and helps any mature eggs to go through one last growth spurt and release. In other words, ovulate!         During treatment with gonadotropins, you may be given either an injection of rLH or, more commonly, hCG . This acts like the natural LH spike and will trigger ovulation. What to Expect Gonadotropins may be used on their own. They may also be used as part of an IUI treatment or IVF treatment cycle. Below is an explanation of how they may be used on their own. When you get your next period, you'll call your doctor. You'll then have some blood work and an ultrasound. This is to make sure there are no complications or reasons you can't be treated in this cycle. (For example, to ensure you aren't pregnant and don't have a benign ovarian cyst .) Your doctor will likely start you off with 75 to 150 IU of the gonadotropin medication. Depending on which gonadotropin is prescribed, you'll need to give yourself injections just below the skin (subcutaneously) or into the muscle (intramuscularly). Ask your doctor or nurse to demonstrate how to safely perform the injections. They will likely do this without you asking. How to Give Yourself a Subcutaneous Injection How to Give Yourself an IM Injection Over the next several days, your hormone levels, specifically estradiol , and the follicles on your ovaries will be closely monitored.         This monitoring happens via blood work and ultrasound every few days. How often? That will depend on your doctor's protocol, how you're responding to the drugs, and how close you are to ovulation. Your medications may be adjusted up or down depending on the ultrasound and hormone results. The goal is to stimulate the ovaries enough to produce one good egg, but not to overstimulate them. Other stimulation can increase your risks of a multiple pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). When your hormone levels and follicle size indicate ovulation is close, your doctor may order an injection of hCG.  This is also known as the " trigger shot ." It triggers ovulation to occur approximately 36 hours later. Your doctor should also tell you which days to have intercourse, so you can"catch" the egg and get pregnant! How to Cope with Doctor Prescribed Conception Sex During Treatment Once ovulation occurs, you may then start taking progesterone . Not everyone will need this, however. Your hormone levels will continue to be monitored, though less frequently. You'll take a pregnancy test at the end of the cycle to determine if treatment was successful. Sometimes, treatment may be canceled in the middle. This may occur before the trigger shot or even earlier. The most common reason for cycle cancellation is your doctor suspects the ovaries have been hyperstimulated. Stopping the medications can avoid a serious case of OHSS and high-order multiples. Your doctor may also tell you to refrain from intercourse. As difficult as it is to hear this, it's very important you follow your doctor's instructions. Pregnancy can increase the chances of a high-order pregnancy, which puts you and your babies at risk. Also, if you develop OHSS, pregnancy can complicate your recovery. Different Types There are two basic types of gonadotropins: recombinant gonadotropins and urinary-extracted gonadotropins. Recombinant gonadotropins are created in a laboratory using recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant FSH gonadotropins on the market include Gonal-F and Follistim. Currently, Luveris is the only recombinant LH gonadotropin available. Urinary-extracted gonadotropins are extracted and purified from the urine of postmenopausal women. (Their urine is naturally high in FSH.) They include human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), purified FSH and highly purified FSH. Purified urine-extracted FSH gonadotropins include Bravelle and Fertinex. Human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) contains FSH and LH. It includes medications like Humegon, Menogon, Pergonal and Repronex. Menopur is a highly purified hMG. A related drug, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often part of fertility treatment with gonadotropin injections . You may know hCG as the pregnancy hormone , but it also happens to be molecularly similar to LH. In a natural cycle, LH triggers ovulation . As part of fertility treatment , an injection of hCG may be used to trigger ovulation. Ovidrel, Novarel, Pregnyl and Profasi are brand names for hCG injectables. Associated Risks Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially serious complication of gonadotropin therapy. Mild OHSS occurs in 10% to 20% of women taking gonadotropins. Serious OHSS occurs 1% of the time. Serious OHSS can be deadly if ignored or not treated properly. It's important you are familiar with the symptoms. OHSS Symptoms and Treatment Another possible risk factor of gonadotropin therapy is a multiple pregnancy. Some studies have found that up to 30% of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins are twins or more. (This is compared to just 1% to 2% of naturally conceived pregnancies.) Most multiple pregnancies with gonadotropins are twins. Up to 5% are triplets or more. Multiple pregnancies , including twin pregnancies , are risky for the mother and the babies. Close monitoring of a treatment cycle can help prevent a multiple pregnancy. Many doctors will cancel if more than three follicles develop or if estradiol levels are very high. Some studies have been able to get the rate of multiples pregnancies as low as 5%. They have done this by starting at a low dose, using slow increases only when necessary and close monitoring. Twin Pregnancy Risks Should I Get Pregnant with Twins on Purpose? Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? The risk of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage is higher with gonadotropin-conceived pregnancies. Less than 1% of women taking gonadotropins will experience adnexal torsion, or ovarian twisting. This is when the ovary twists on itself and cuts off its own blood supply. Surgery is necessary to untwist or possibly remove the affected ovary. Your risk of pregnancy complications -- like pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and placental abruption -- may be slightly increased as compared to a naturally conceived pregnancy. Whether this is caused by the gonadotropins or the infertility is unclear. Because gonadotropins are injectable medications, you may also experience soreness near the injection sites. If you suspect an infection, be sure to alert your doctor right away. Side Effects and Risks of Gonadotropins What Are the Success Rates? Your potential for pregnancy success with gonadotropins will depend on a variety of factors, including your age and the cause of infertility. A 2011 study by The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine looked at 1,400 gonadotropin treatment cycles. The overall pregnancy rate was 12%, with the live birth rate about 7.7%. Younger patients had higher live birth rates. In this study, by canceling the cycle if three or more dominant follicles developed or estradiol levels were higher than 1500 pg/ml, they were able to keep the multiple pregnancy rate a low 2.6%. Older studies have found higher pregnancy rates with gonadotropins than this one. However, it's possible the higher success rate came at the expense of higher risk for OHSS and multiple pregnancy. Cost of Treatment Gonadotropin treatment that is not an IUI or IVF cycle can cost anywhere between $500 to $5,000. The higher price takes into account blood work and ultrasound monitoring. Also, the price varies because different women will need different amounts of drugs. Your insurance company may pay for part of treatment. Or, they may pay for all of it... or none of it. You may need to pay your fertility clinic in full first. Then, you may need to file for a refund from your insurance yourself, or the clinic may handle the insurance claims for you. Be sure to clarify all of this with your fertility clinic before you start treatment. You don't want to be surprised by a high bill at the end.

Multiples in pregnancy Twins triplets quads identical and fraternal            Home : Ovulation Planner : Duedate : Baby Names : Week by Week : Site Map :             Types of Multiples in pregnancy   A pregnancy of two or more fetuses is called a multiple pregnancy. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

What may increase my chances of having twins naturally?  How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins?    How common are twins or more? A lot depends on whether you conceived your twins naturally, or with the help of fertility treatment.  After natural conception , just over one per cent of pregnancies are twins (NCCWCH 2013, NHS 2014) .  For babies born as a result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), where two embryos are put back in the mum's womb (uterus), 24 per cent of births result in twins or triplets (HFEA 2014) . This is about 20 times higher than the rate for natural conception.  Overall, twins , triplets and more account for about three per cent of babies who are born in the UK (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . Are twins more common than they used to be? Yes. The number of twins and triplets born in the UK has increased a lot in the past three decades (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . This increase is mainly because more couples are using fertility treatments to conceive.  Another factor is that women are having babies later in life (NHS 2014) . Older mums have a higher chance of conceiving twins (NHS 2014) . How likely is it I'll have more than one baby after fertility treatment? IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can make it much more likely that you'll conceive multiples than if you'd conceived naturally, but only if you have two embryos transferred (HFEA 2014) .  Fertility clinics have reduced the number of cases where they transfer more than one embryo to a mum receiving treatment. This is because the regulating body, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), now encourages the transfer of one embyro at a time (HFEA 2015) . This is called elective single embryo transfer (eSET).  However, particularly for women aged 35 or over, IVF still often involves introducing two embryos into a woman's womb (HFEA 2015) , raising the chance of twins about 20 times.  Some fertility drugs such as clomifene or gonadotrophins stimulate the ovaries. This increases the chance that several eggs will be released in one go. About eight per cent of women who take the fertility drug clomifene have a multiple pregnancy, usually twins (EMC 2014) .  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have been unsuccessful at getting pregnant with clomifene, have a 36 per cent chance of multiple pregnancy if they take gonadotrophins (NCCWCH 2013) . What may increase my chances of having twins naturally? The chances of having twins increases if you are 35 or older (NHS 2014, Utting and Bewley 2011) . As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which can trigger the ovaries to release several eggs in a single month.  Non-identical twins tend to run in families . This is probably because of an inherited tendency to release more than one egg that then causes this type of twinning. So if you're female and non-identical twins run in your side of the family, you're more likely to have them yourself (NHS 2014) .  If you are a black woman, especially if you are of Central African descent, you're also slightly more likely to have twins (NHS 2014, Smits and Monden 2011) . How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins? The likelihood of you having identical twins is about one in 350 to 400 (NHS 2014) . About a third of twins are identical (McAslan Fraser 2012) .  Whether or not you conceive identical twins seems to be entirely down to chance. Identical twins develop when one fertilised egg divides into two. Nobody knows what causes an egg to split and become identical twins (NHS 2014) .  If you think you might be expecting twins, find out how soon you'll know for sure .

Share                  In this article   How common are twins or more?  Are twins more common than they used to be?  How likely is it I'll have more than one baby after fertility treatment?  What may increase my chances of having twins naturally?  How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins?    How common are twins or more? A lot depends on whether you conceived your twins naturally, or with the help of fertility treatment.  After natural conception , just over one per cent of pregnancies are twins (NCCWCH 2013, NHS 2014) .  For babies born as a result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), where two embryos are put back in the mum's womb (uterus), 24 per cent of births result in twins or triplets (HFEA 2014) . This is about 20 times higher than the rate for natural conception.  Overall, twins , triplets and more account for about three per cent of babies who are born in the UK (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . Are twins more common than they used to be? Yes. The number of twins and triplets born in the UK has increased a lot in the past three decades (NCCWCH 2011, ONS 2014) . This increase is mainly because more couples are using fertility treatments to conceive.  Another factor is that women are having babies later in life (NHS 2014) . Older mums have a higher chance of conceiving twins (NHS 2014) . How likely is it I'll have more than one baby after fertility treatment? IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can make it much more likely that you'll conceive multiples than if you'd conceived naturally, but only if you have two embryos transferred (HFEA 2014) .  Fertility clinics have reduced the number of cases where they transfer more than one embryo to a mum receiving treatment. This is because the regulating body, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), now encourages the transfer of one embyro at a time (HFEA 2015) . This is called elective single embryo transfer (eSET).  However, particularly for women aged 35 or over, IVF still often involves introducing two embryos into a woman's womb (HFEA 2015) , raising the chance of twins about 20 times.  Some fertility drugs such as clomifene or gonadotrophins stimulate the ovaries. This increases the chance that several eggs will be released in one go. About eight per cent of women who take the fertility drug clomifene have a multiple pregnancy, usually twins (EMC 2014) .  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have been unsuccessful at getting pregnant with clomifene, have a 36 per cent chance of multiple pregnancy if they take gonadotrophins (NCCWCH 2013) . What may increase my chances of having twins naturally? The chances of having twins increases if you are 35 or older (NHS 2014, Utting and Bewley 2011) . As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which can trigger the ovaries to release several eggs in a single month.  Non-identical twins tend to run in families . This is probably because of an inherited tendency to release more than one egg that then causes this type of twinning. So if you're female and non-identical twins run in your side of the family, you're more likely to have them yourself (NHS 2014) .  If you are a black woman, especially if you are of Central African descent, you're also slightly more likely to have twins (NHS 2014, Smits and Monden 2011) . How likely is it I'll conceive identical twins? The likelihood of you having identical twins is about one in 350 to 400 (NHS 2014) . About a third of twins are identical (McAslan Fraser 2012) .  Whether or not you conceive identical twins seems to be entirely down to chance. Identical twins develop when one fertilised egg divides into two. Nobody knows what causes an egg to split and become identical twins (NHS 2014) .  If you think you might be expecting twins, find out how soon you'll know for sure .

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Nick Martin and Grant Montgomery, senior research fellows at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research in Brisbane, Australia, specialize in twin studies. They supply the following answer.  There is no doubt that twinning seems to run in some families. Closer investigation reveals that this is mainly confined to nonidentical, or fraternal (dizygotic - DZ) twins, although there are a few rare families with extraordinary numbers of identical (monozygotic - MZ) twins. Furthermore, the increased chance of twinning seems to be entirely a property of the mother, not the father. Of course, there are counter examples to all these rules, and there are even families with large numbers of both identical and fraternal twins. At the moment it is not clear whether these just occur by chance and we get to hear about them due to reporting bias (they always make great front page stories) or whether they represent some new biological mechanism. The strongest clues we have--that it is confined to fraternal twinning and females--suggest that the primary cause is an increased risk of multiple ovulation, in which a woman releases two or more eggs in a given menstrual cycle rather than the normal one. We tested this by ultrasound scanning of ovaries just before ovulation in mothers who had previously given birth to two sets of fraternal twins (MODZTs). Such women showed a much higher rate of multiple ovulation than control women did. The maturation and release of one or more eggs is controlled by several reproductive hormones, including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and inhibins. We checked the level of these hormones in MODZTs and controls at different parts of the menstrual cycle and showed that there were some abnormalities, although these were not very consistent. Perhaps the most intriguing finding is Dutch evidence that MODZTs release FSH in more frequent pulses than normal women. The best evidence for twinning genes comes from sheep, where mutations in two genes increase twinning by altering the response of the ovary to FSH. Currently, we are collecting DNA from pairs of sisters who have both had fraternal twins, because these will enable us to use genetic linkage analysis to locate the genes responsible for familial fraternal twinning. Once we have found them, and understood the mechanisms by which they work, we may well be able to predict which particular women have a greater chance of having twins. Meanwhile, the best way of increasing your chances of having fraternal twins if you are female is to have a mother, a sister, or an aunt (on either your mother's or father's side) who has had fraternal twins. If you are male, then marry a woman who fits this description because it seems that the father has no influence on the chance of twins, although he can pass the tendency to his daughters. Another major factor is maternal age; a woman who gives birth at 37 is four times more likely to have fraternal twins than at age 18, although she is also more likely to be unable to conceive, since many women's ovaries are already starting to fail at that age. The third major risk factor is race; West Africans are ten times more likely to have fraternal twins than Chinese or Japanese, with Caucasians intermediate. Some increased chance is also seen in African-Americans. Interestingly, neither maternal age nor race seems to influence identical twinning, which is almost universally constant at about four per 1000 births. Finally, all the above only applies to spontaneous, or natural, births. The introduction of assisted reproduction techniques (ART), particularly ovarian stimulation, has seen a dramatic rise in the number of twin and higher multiple births. They also slightly increase the chance of having identical twins, which suggests that there may be some connection between the two types of twinning.
