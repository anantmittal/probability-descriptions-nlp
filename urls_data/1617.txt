If you listen to the news reports about Zika, you’d think that Puerto Rico was ground zero for the zombie apocalypse .  If you have plans to travel to Puerto Rico you might be concerned. But, before you get all freaked out and start canceling your trip, do a little research, understand the facts, and make an informed decision. People here on the island are still alive and well, and we need tourists more than ever!  If you don’t feel like reading this whole article, just read and understand this part … You should be aware that there is a risk (a very small risk) of getting Zika while on vacation in Puerto Rico. You can reduce that risk even further by applying mosquito repellent with DEET both while indoors and outdoors, wearing long sleeve shirts and long pants, and by keeping doors/windows closed and using air-conditioning.  According to the CDC, the only people that really need to consider canceling their travel plans are pregnant women and those trying to conceive. The CDC guidelines indicate that women in any trimester should avoid travel to destinations with active local Zika virus transmission. The Zika virus can live in semen for months following infection, so men should use a condom during sex if they have been exposed to the Zika virus.  What is Zika?  Zika Virus Disease (or simply Zika ) is a disease caused by the Zika virus (or ZIKV ), which is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Zika virus was first discovered in 1947, and is named after the Zika Forest in Uganda. In 1952, the first human cases of Zika were detected and, since then, outbreaks of Zika have been reported in tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.  In May 2015, the first confirmed Zika cases were reported in Brazil, and it has since spread throughout the Caribbean — including Puerto Rico. In November 2015, the first locally acquired case of Zika was reported in Puerto Rico. The Zika virus may be introduced into areas by travelers who become infected while visiting other areas where the virus exists.  As of June 2016, there have been locally acquired cases of Zika across the Caribbean, throughout Central America, and throughout South America (except Chile and Uruguay). Travel-associated cases of Zika have been reported in all of the US States, except for Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.    How is Zika Virus Spread?  Zika cannot be spread directly from person to person — so you can’t catch it from shaking hands, a sneeze, a doorknob or a toilet seat. ZIKV is spread from person to person by the bite of an infected mosquito. ZIKV is most often spread between people by the by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito.  Here in Puerto Rico, Aedes aegypti is the principal mosquito carrier of Zika virus. This species of mosquito is closely associated with humans and their dwellings. They like to live and breed in a place that is close to their food source — humans — and generally in urban areas, where there are more people available for them to bite! Aedes aegypti prefers to rest in darker cool areas, such as under furniture and in closets — convenient for them to bite people indoors and/or around the household and yard.  The mosquito becomes infected with Zika virus when it bites a person who already has the Zika virus in their blood, A single infected mosquito can infect multiple people, who in turn can infect multiple mosquitoes — and the cycle continues.  What makes Zika more scary than other mosquito-borne disease is that Zika can be passed from a pregnant mother to her fetus, which in turn may cause the baby to have microcephaly or other severe fetal brain defects. Zika can also be spread sexually from an infected male to his sex partners.    What are the Symptoms of Zika?  Only 25% of people infected with the Zika virus will exhibit symptoms, so most people with Zika won’t even know they have it .   Zika is characterized by fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache.  Symptoms typically appear 2 to 12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms are typically mild and last about a week. People usually don’t get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika.  The symptoms of Zika are similar to the symptoms of Chikungunya and Dengue (both which we also have here in Puerto Rico), so it is possible to mis-diagnose the disease.  What is the Treatment for Zika?  See your doctor if you suspect that you have Zika, and tell your doctor that you recently visited the Caribbean.  There is no specific medication for treatment of a Zika infection. People who think they have Zika should use acetaminophen or paracetamol, to relieve fever and pain. They should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and consult a physician. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) should be avoided until dengue can be ruled out.    How to Prevent Zika  There is no vaccination to protect you from Zika. So the way to prevent the virus is to prevent getting bitten by an infected mosquito in the first place.  The adult mosquitoes feed (bite) inside a dwelling as well as outside near their “homes”, during the day and at night when the lights are on. To protect yourself, use mosquito repellent on your skin while indoors or out. When possible, wear long sleeves and pants for additional protection. Also, make sure window and door screens are secure and without holes. If available, use air-conditioning.  Use mosquito spray (Raid Flying Insect, or something similar) in your home and your hotel room. Even though we don’t live in a high Zika area, we still spray dark corners and under the furniture a couple times a day, just as a precaution.  For locals, mosquitoes breed in standing water. If there are any places where water lays around your home or workplace, be sure to dump them on a daily basis. This includes pet water bowls, saucers under plants, buckets and anywhere else water might accumulate. Eliminating places where mosquitoes breed will reduce the number of mosquitoes available to spread dengue. We can all help to break the cycle.    How Widespread is Zika in Puerto Rico?  Contrary to what the new media would have you believe, Zika is not the black plague here on the island. If you look at the most recent statistics (18 November 2016) from the Puerto Rico Department of Health, there were 2705 new cases of Zika confirmed in the past 2 weeks, bringing the total to 34060 cases of Zika confirmed since the beginning of 2016. That’s about 9.7% of the population .  Those cases are primarily concentrated in the San Juan metro area, the Ponce area, and the Arecibo area. There are cases in all municipalities on the island.  You are not likely to catch Zika at the beach, in the rain forest, on a bio bay tour or on a snorkeling tour — as these are just not places that are that hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito. But remember, no matter where you go or what you do, you might want to take precautions to reduce your chances of getting Zika. I feel it is better to be safe than sorry.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She added, “We’ve become more concerned” about the period around the time of conception. “For people who either have the Zika disease or who travel to an area with active Zika transmission, we are now recommending they wait a period of time before trying to get pregnant.”     Zika Virus Rumors and Theories That You Should Doubt  Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.             For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

Greg Allen/NPR     The Zika virus is a health threat not just to Latin America, but also to parts of the U.S. It's already a problem in Puerto Rico where there are nearly 120 cases so far, including five pregnant women. That's a concern, because Zika may be involved in causing birth defects .  The U.S. territory has declared a public health emergency and is working to protect residents from Zika and from the primary mosquito that carries the disease, Aedes aegypti . The species is largely responsible for the spread of Zika and many other tropical diseases, including yellow fever and dengue. It can breed anywhere it finds as little as a teaspoonful of standing water.  In Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities, emergency crews are looking for the places the mosquitoes breed. In Guaynabo, a suburb of Puerto Rico's capital San Juan, Luis Hernandez gets out of his truck to take a look at some old tires piled outside a home. Hernandez is an entomologist who advises local authorities on how to combat the A. aegypti .     He dips a cup into one of the tires and shows me what's inside. A dozen or more mosquito larvae wriggle in the water.  "That means this tire has been here for more than one week," Hernandez says. "Because of the size of the larvae, I know how long the tire's been here."  There are dumps of old tires from automobiles and trucks everywhere in Puerto Rico. That's because the recycling fees customers pay when they purchase tires don't cover the actual cost of disposal. Tires pile up and they become breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  Puerto Rico's legislature has passed an emergency measure to pay the cost of picking up and recycling tires. In Guaynabo, emergency response crews have already started collecting the tires, sending a grapple truck to clean up 15 sites in the municipality.  Crews are also working to remove standing water around schools, abandoned houses and even cemeteries, where flower vases can serve as mosquito breeding areas.      Shots - Health News  With CDC Help, Puerto Rico Aims To Get Ahead Of Zika        Unsealed septic tanks can also be a problem. Crews will inspect and install screens over vents where they're needed.  Puerto Rico's governor wants this work done in 45 days, before the start of the rainy season.  In Guaynabo, no cases of Zika have been reported yet. But long before most people had heard of Zika, Guaynabo was dealing with another tropical disease — dengue. It's sometimes called bonebreak fever , and can lead to death.  "We had many, many cases. Dengue was really hard here," says Dr. Silvia Medina, Guaynabo's former health director. Medina is helping Guaynabo now as a consultant, taking charts, pictures and information about Zika out to the community. She did something similar during the last dengue outbreak.  "We went into the communities, school, churches — everywhere," Medina says. "We had good results. When people are educated, they're healthy people."  As part of the public health emergency, Puerto Rico is asking all residents to check their homes and the homes of their neighbors for standing water and mosquitoes. A big problem in Puerto Rico is that most homes aren't air conditioned and many lack screens, so residents are exposed to more mosquitoes.  Hernandez says fumigation trucks respond quickly when crews get calls from areas where there are lots of mosquitoes. But A. aegypti mosquitoes spend much of their time indoors, Hernandez says, so aerial spraying is often not effective. And when the fumigation trucks begin spraying in a neighborhood, residents often close their windows, he says.  Hernandez throws up his hands in frustration. "If the mosquito is inside with you, and you close the window," he says, you and your family may still be bitten.  The Obama administration has asked Congress for more than $200 million to help Puerto Rico protect residents. Dr. Johnny Rullan is a former Puerto Rico secretary of health who is advising the government on its Zika response. After outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya and now Zika, Rullan says, it's clear Puerto Rico has to get serious about protecting residents from A. aegypti.  "We will have to do like we did for yellow fever," he says. "We declared war on yellow fever and Puerto Rico was successful. We have declared war now on the Aedes aegypti mosquito and we need to win it."  Puerto Rico is scrambling to adopt mosquito control measures in the next six weeks, before the rainy season begins. Rullan says these are measures that the island should already have put in place — over the last 30 years.     microcephaly  Zika virus  Guillain-Barre syndrome  mosquitoes  dengue fever  Puerto Rico       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

Press Release  Embargoed Until: Friday, July 29, 2016 11:00 a.m. EDT Contact:  Media Relations (404) 639-3286   As of July 7, Zika has been diagnosed in 5,582* people, including 672 pregnant women, in Puerto Rico according to a new report published today in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ). Positive tests for people with suspected Zika virus infection have increased from 14 percent in February to 64 percent in June. Positive tests through blood supply screening also increased, reaching 1.8 percent during the latest week of reporting starting July 3.  “Puerto Rico is in the midst of a Zika epidemic. The virus is silently and rapidly spreading in Puerto Rico,” said Lyle R. Petersen, M.D., M.P.H, Incident Manager for CDC’s Zika Response and Director, Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. “This could lead to hundreds of infants being born with microcephaly or other birth defects in the coming year. We must do all we can to protect pregnant women from Zika and to prepare to care for infants born with microcephaly.”  Many of the 5,582 people who tested positive for Zika virus infections were tested because they had symptoms of Zika. Because Zika infection during pregnancy can harm the developing fetus, pregnant women in Puerto Rico and other areas where Zika is spreading should be routinely tested during prenatal care whether or not they got sick. Of the 672 pregnant women, 441 (66 percent) experienced symptoms of Zika and 231 (34 percent) had no symptoms. Because approximately 80 percent of people infected with Zika do not have symptoms, the 672 pregnant women with evidence of Zika infection likely represent only a fraction of those who may be infected to date.  In addition, 21 people with confirmed or suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome in Puerto Rico had evidence of Zika virus infection or recent unspecified flavivirus infection, and one person died after developing severe thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count).  Since local transmission of Zika virus was first reported in Puerto Rico in December 2015, it has become widespread on the island. People in 77 of 78 municipalities have tested positive for Zika virus infection. Large urban areas are most severely affected, with the largest numbers of diagnosed residents in the San Juan metropolitan area followed by the Ponce and Caguas metropolitan areas.  Outbreaks of mosquito-borne viruses tend to peak in the late summer and fall in Puerto Rico—hotter months with higher rainfall—raising concern that Zika will continue to spread and increase in the coming months. At the current trend, hundreds to thousands more pregnant women in Puerto Rico could become infected with Zika by the end of the year. There is also risk for more Guillain-Barré syndrome cases associated with Zika virus infection. The situation in Puerto Rico warrants urgent, comprehensive action to protect pregnant women:   The government of Puerto Rico and its municipalities can promote an integrated mosquito management program that includes reducing places with water where mosquitoes lay eggs, keeping mosquitoes out of houses with screens on windows and doors, and reducing the number of mosquitoes by using EPA-approved products. Everyone can follow these steps to help reduce the number of mosquitoes in and around homes.  People who live in or travel to Puerto Rico should avoid mosquito bites by using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, and staying indoors in places with screens and air conditioning to the greatest extent possible.  Pregnant women and their partners should use condoms and other barriers to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus, or not have sex throughout the pregnancy.  Couples who want to prevent or delay pregnancy should talk to their healthcare provider about safe and effective contraceptive methods.  Clinicians who suspect Zika in patients who live in or have recently returned from areas with Zika, such as Puerto Rico, should report cases to public health officials.   CDC is working with Puerto Rico to provide services to protect pregnant women from Zika, support pregnant women who have been infected with Zika, increase lab testing, improve mosquito control, and provide access to contraception for women who choose to delay or avoid pregnancy.  * CDC only publishes data on our website that has been provided through ArboNET. Although Puerto Rico reports data to ArboNET, the Puerto Rico Department of Health reports cases from its own surveillance system, not ArboNET data.  Differences in reporting between these surveillance systems contributes to different numbers being reported.  ### U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES      Connect with CDC Media   Subscribe to Media RSS Feeds   Subscribe to CDC Media e-mail   Syndicate Media on Your Site   CDC Quick Links   CDC In The News  Data & Statistics  Freedom of Information Act Office  Public Health Image Library (PHIL)              Language: English (US) Español (Spanish)       File Formats Help: How do I view different file formats (PDF, DOC, PPT, MPEG) on this site?

Marisa Penaloza/NPR  hide caption    toggle caption   Marisa Penaloza/NPR          Yalieth Gonzalez and her baby Micaela Delgado at the Maternal Infant Studies Center at the University of Puerto Rico.  Marisa Penaloza/NPR     Micaela Delgado is a beautiful dark-eyed baby girl with a ready smile. She's 8 months old. She's one of more than 1,000 babies already born in Puerto Rico to mothers with Zika.  Her mother, Yalieth Gonzalez, 22, says despite all her worries, so far Micaela's development appears normal. "She's very active, she's up on her own now, she's crawling," Gonzalez says. "She's saying, 'mama' and 'papa' already. She's a very happy baby. She has a lot of energy." But Gonzalez is on alert for signs of trouble.  Gonzalez doesn't know how she got Zika, which is spread by mosquitoes. She was just three months pregnant when she had symptoms and went to the hospital. Doctors monitored her baby's development with regular ultrasounds and warned her about the possibility of birth defects.  The worst part of her pregnancy was her delivery. Gonzalez says she was in labor for 22 long, agonizing hours and she spent that time worrying. "'What would I do if she was born with health problems?' I thought. I was young. What would my life be like? I wanted to see her, but at the same time, I was scared, scared of how I would feel if she was born with medical problems."     Since Zika appeared in Puerto Rico more than a year ago, doctors believe as many as a million people on the island have been infected. Some 40,000 of those cases have been confirmed , a number that includes some 3,200 pregnant women. Doctors in Puerto Rico are just beginning to assess the long-term consequences for children born to mothers with Zika.  Yalieth Gonzalez was treated at the High Risk Pregnancy Clinic at the University of Puerto Rico's hospital. Dr. Alberto de la Vega has seen one-fifth of the pregnant women on the island who tested positive for Zika. "Among those patients we've had at least 14 or 15 confirmed cases in which severe brain damage, caused by the Zika virus, has occurred," he says.  Some of those cases included microcephaly .  For babies born to mothers infected in the first trimester, de la Vega says the risk of brain damage is between 2 and 4 percent. But he's seeing many other problems in his patients infected with Zika, including mothers going into premature labor and a higher number of miscarriages.  What worries him most is that even in cases where babies appear normal, their brains show lagging growth. "What does that mean in terms of future development? No one has an idea," he says. "If you have a condition that can cause severe brain damage, it's not going to be an either-or situation. There has to be a spectrum of problems that are yet to be defined."  De la Vega and other doctors are also concerned about young children who contract Zika after birth, at a time when their brains are still actively developing. Puerto Rico's Health Department plans to monitor these children for three to five years.  Many are being seen at the University of Puerto Rico by Dr. Carmen Zorrilla . She runs the Maternal Infant Studies Center at the University of Puerto Rico hospital, which was established 30 years ago to help women living with HIV.  Zika, she says, presents some of the same challenges for pregnant women.  Zorrilla also compares the impact of Zika with that of rubella , which caused birth defects in tens of thousands of children in the U.S. until a vaccine was discovered in the late 1960s.      Shots - Health News  Lessons From Rubella Suggest Zika's Impact Could Linger        Years later, Zorrilla says, researchers checked back with adults who had been born to mothers infected with rubella but who appeared normal at birth. "They found an increased rate of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in these people who were exposed to rubella while they were in utero," she says. "So, it's not until 20 years from now that we might say, 'Oh, Zika caused this or that.'"  With the rainy season approaching, the time when disease-carrying mosquitoes become active, Zorrilla worries many on the island have become complacent. One problem, she says, is that women who have babies with birth defects have been reluctant to go public because, like HIV, Zika carries a stigma.  Zorrilla has heard comments like, "Oh, you were not protecting yourself?," "You were not using the mosquito repellent?" or "You were not using condoms?"  "You have pregnant women with a viral disease that may cause birth defects which is serious," Zorrilla says. "And then you're blaming them for getting it."  That's how Yalieth Gonzalez felt when she found out she was infected with Zika. Concerned she would be judged, at first, she only shared the news with her mother and the baby's father.  Her daughter Micaela sees the pediatrician every month to check her development, head size and other benchmarks. Doctors are also monitoring the baby's vision and hearing. It all looks good now, but it could be years before any anomalies are identified.  It was only after Micaela was born that Gonzalez says she felt strong enough to share her story with friends. "People should know that Zika is real. I was lucky that my baby was born healthy. There are many people in Puerto Rico who don't take Zika seriously, and we should," she says.  Epidemiologists expect to see fewer cases in Puerto Rico this year than last, but the disease is now endemic on the island. That means, until a vaccine is available, Zika will continue to pose a risk for women who become pregnant, and for their babies.     zika  pregnant women  brain damage  birth defects  Puerto Rico       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

This public health message was part of an island-wide effort to stem the spread of Zika.  Angel Valentin/Getty Images     The number of new Zika cases in Puerto Rico has dropped dramatically in recent weeks, yet health officials worry the full effect of the outbreak on the island may not be known for months or years to come.  Puerto Rico has confirmed more than 34,000 Zika infections since the virus was first detected on the island in November 2015.  Tyler M. Sharp, acting head of epidemiology at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Dengue Branch in San Juan, says the outbreak peaked during the summer.  "In mid-August we were at more than 2,000 [confirmed] lab cases per week coming in," Sharp says. "Now we are at a little over 200 per week, so the numbers are down from where they were at the worst part of the outbreak. But there is continued transmission, so there's continued risk both to pregnant women and everybody else who's present on the island."  Sharp says that compared with other mosquito-borne outbreaks, such as chikungunya or dengue, the spread of Zika in the U.S. territory this year was huge.     "The number of Zika virus disease cases that we've documented in Puerto Rico in the last year is substantially larger than we've seen for any dengue epidemic in the last ..." he pauses to ponder how long, "Well, ever."  That's in part because dengue has been circulating in the territory for decades.  "Many people in Puerto Rico have immunity against dengue," Sharp explains. "When Zika was introduced nobody had immunity, so effectively everybody was susceptible."      Zika Virus  Puerto Rico Health Official 'Very Concerned' About Zika's Spread        The tricky thing about Zika is that most people who get infected have mild cases; some don't have any symptoms at all. But the virus has also been linked to neurological problems, including severe birth defects such as microcephaly .  Health officials' greatest concern about Zika has been its potential effect on pregnant women and their developing fetuses. More than 2,600 pregnant women on the island have tested positive for Zika infections. Dr. Brenda Rivera, the territorial epidemiologist with the Puerto Rico Department of Health, says among those pregnancies only a handful of fetal abnormalities have been confirmed. Most of those were seen in pregnancies that were aborted or didn't go all the way to term.  "We still don't know what the implications are of having been infected during pregnancy," she says. "We still don't know if you're going to show developmental problems later on. You might be normal at birth with normal head circumference, no overt structural abnormalities but what developmental problems we might see in these kids later on, that's still a question that hasn't been satisfactorily answered."  A study out of Brazil published Nov. 22 found that some babies exposed to Zika in the womb and who weren't born with microcephaly ended up developing it later on. Those children however did show abnormalities on brain scans at birth.  Researchers and health officials, including Rivera in Puerto Rico, say huge questions about this virus and its effects on pregnancy remain.  Even though transmission of Zika appears to have peaked in Puerto Rico, Rivera says the real work of figuring this disease out lies ahead. She and her colleagues have their eyes on more than 2,600 pregnancies. "About half of those are still ongoing," she says. "So there's a lot that we still need to monitor, and our intent is to monitor the children of these pregnancies for up to three years to better understand the scope of the disease."

In August, at the peak of the epidemic in the US territory, the US Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency when the number of cases there surpassed 10,000, including more than 1,000 pregnant women. But there have only been 10 new cases reported since the end of April, according to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Zika in Puerto Rico now a public health emergency The mosquito-borne disease, which is also sexually transmitted, is of greatest concern to pregnant women and those trying to become pregnant and their partners because of the devastating consequences it can have on a fetus. 1 in 10 Zika-infected US moms have babies with birth defects, CDC reports As of May 20, the most recent data available, the Puerto Rico Department of Health reported (PDF) 40,330 confirmed cases of the Zika virus since the outbreak began last year. Four hundred twenty-two of those infected have been hospitalized, and five individuals have died. Among those cases, there have been 52 Zika-related cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome , a type of temporary paralysis that is caused by viruses including Zika. The Puerto Rico Department of Health has reported only 38 cases of Zika-related birth defects. Read More Although the epidemic is officially over, mosquito control and surveillance will continue, as will screening and monitoring of pregnant women. "While there are very low levels of mosquito-borne Zika transmission now, it is important that we remain vigilant to keep these numbers down and support families already affected by Zika," State Epidemiologist Dr. Carmen Deseda said in a news release Monday announcing the end of the epidemic. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention echoed the need for continued vigilance. Its recommendation that pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant not travel to areas with Zika, including Puerto Rico, remains in effect. Due to the continued risk of Zika, the agency said the Health and Human Services public health emergency declaration, which was renewed at the end of April, also remains in effect. That declaration is set to expire at the end of July.

An update on last year’s epidemic—before you book your spring break travels.   By Nikki Ekstein  @nikkiekstein  More stories by Nikki Ekstein       February 8, 2017, 10:47 AM EST                    The Zika Virus Explained in Two Minutes      It’s been more than a year since the Centers for Disease Control issued the first warning about travel to Brazil and the Caribbean because of the Zika virus. From January to August of last year, the virus dominated headlines and sent travel agents and hoteliers into a frenzy. Hotels in Zika zones like the St. Regis Puerto Rico saw business losses as great as 30 percent, while an unprecedented boom brought twice as many travelers to a flurry of resorts in Zika-free Hawaii. But for the last few months, Zika has been out of sight and out of mind. Does that mean you should stop worrying about it? Here’s what the experts have to say.  The Bad News Fighting Zika with pesticide spraying in Miami Beach. Photographer: Joe Raedle/Getty Images      Zika was never eradicated from the 30 Caribbean islands and 18 countries in South America where it appeared last year, and the disease is now showing up everywhere from Southeast Asia to the South Pacific. But you haven’t been hearing about Zika lately because, for one, it&apos;s winter, when mosquitoes don’t thrive. And the U.S. presidential election has dominated air waves since the Rio Olympics finished virus-free last August, leaving the story to simmer (very softly) on the back burner. And yet, between the months of November and January, the CDC has logged almost 4,000 new cases of Zika in the U.S., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. “The disease as we understand it now is scarier than we originally thought,” said Kristin Lamoureux, associate dean of New York University&apos;s Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. “It’s not quite the same as SARS or Ebola or other diseases that are contained geographically,” she explained, adding that other mosquito-borne diseases (like malaria or dengue fever) carry less stigma because they’re known to be curable. “We know we’re going to see Zika again in the spring,” she said. The Good News The St. Regis in Puerto Rico, where tourism has started to rebound. Source: The St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort, Puerto Rico Miami has served as a useful case study. When the city saw its first few cases of Zika transmission last summer, the local government acted quickly, enforcing a tripartite strategy of aerial spraying, manual spraying, and local awareness that eradicated the disease. “Miami Beach is a beacon of hope that Zika can be contained,” said Lamoureux, who added that other destinations can replicate the same model to contain outbreaks, or even prevent them, if they have the organizational means and resources to do so.      Other locales have managed to stay blissfully free of Zika altogether. Bermuda has never appeared on the CDC Travel Notice list, and neither have Uruguay, Chile, and Hawaii. And there’s compelling evidence that Puerto Rico has curtailed the number of cases dramatically. Even better, according to former Food and Drug Administration chief and public health expert Dr. Jesse Goodman, nearly a dozen Zika vaccines are currently in trial phases, and at least one of them is entering early human studies. When that happens, Zika will be no different than malaria: a mosquito-borne virus that can be reliably combated whenever exposure puts you at risk. But a safe and effective vaccine is still a few years away. Until then, Goodman, who has sat on boards and committees for the CDC, National Institutes of Health, and World Health Organization, sees Zika becoming endemic, just like malaria, chikungunya, and dengue. “My suspicion is that over a period of a couple of years, the people most exposed to Zika will become immune to it—which will make the rates of infection go down a lot,” he said. Goodman’s advice: If you have a destination in mind for your next trip, sign up for text alerts from the CDC here to get the most up-to-the-minute information.  What Now? Adult mosquitoes as seen under a microscope. Photographer: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images The link between Zika and microcephaly may have been called into question last fall by a story in the Washington Post , which claimed that the correlation has primarily been limited to a small area in northern Brazil. But Goodman says the science is clear. “The scientific community has come to a consensus that there’s a clear risk between Zika and microcephaly,” he told Bloomberg, “along with a variety of other severe pregnancy outcomes, in some cases including miscarriages.” For women in their first trimester, the risk of incidence has been estimated at 15 percent to 20 percent, he says. And while that’s not small, early studies had pinned the numbers as being higher. (The correlation between Zika and Guillain-Barré syndrome is still much, much smaller: Only 13 of the 4,973 Americans who have contracted Zika got the autoimmune disorder.) What’s less clear, said Goodman, is whether gestational Zika can lead to other pediatric conditions like learning disabilities, and why microcephaly has been so much more prevalent in some regions (like northern Brazil) than others. All things considered, he says the recommendation is still that “pregnant women and women looking to get pregnant avoid all nonessential travel, or get tested during their pregnancy if they’ve been exposed.” For many travelers, exposure to Zika is bound to become something of an inevitability. “The comfort level for travelers has risen [when it comes to going to the Caribbean] now that Zika has been out of the conversation for a while,” said luxury travel specialist Jack Ezon of Ovation Travel. Business was up 43 percent in the Caribbean and Mexico last month, and spring break bookings are almost back to their normal volume after dipping by up to 30 percent in 2016. “Only 15 percent of travelers are even asking about Zika anymore, compared to about 70 percent last year,” Ezon added. “What we are noticing is more of a wait-and-see approach,” he said, pointing to a spike in last-minute warm weather trips; likely, travelers want to feel as confident as possible that another Zika outbreak isn’t on the horizon. To that, we say: Avoid the beach at twilight, dawn, and dusk. Pack the chicest coverup you own, and wear it often. Request a room on your hotel’s higher floors.

A pickup truck from the Department of Health fumigates in San Juan, Jan. 27, 2016. Alvin Baez/Reuters         Email     Twitter     Facebook     LinkedIn     WhatsApp     Messenger       The United States declared Zika a public health emergency in Puerto Rico in August 2016.  Over 28,000 cases of Zika were reported in Puerto Rico as of Oct. 26. In contrast, just over 4,000 cases of Zika were reported in the continental U.S. and Hawaii by the same date. Most of these cases are travel-related, meaning that people are infected while abroad. But in Puerto Rico, 98 percent of Zika cases are locally acquired. It is estimated that up 80 percent of people who are infected with Zika are asymptomatic, which means that reported cases may be just a fraction of those who may be infected.  The U.S. Surgeon General said that one in four Puerto Ricans could be infected by the end of the year. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 5,900 to 10,300 pregnant women might get infected during the initial Zika outbreak in Puerto Rico. In the absence of effective interventions like birth control or mosquito control, about 100 to 270 infants may be born with Zika-related microcephaly from mid-2016 to mid-2017.  So why is Zika so much worse in Puerto Rico than in the continental U.S.?  Mosquito-borne diseases are complex. Environmental, social, political and cultural factors can influence their transmission. And Puerto Rico, like other parts of the Caribbean and Latin America, has the perfect mix of conditions for a mosquito borne virus to spread widely.     A health worker prepares insecticide before fumigating a neighborhood in San Juan, Jan. 27, 2016.  Alvin Baez/Files/Reuters    Environmental factors  Since the Zika virus was identified in Brazil, it has spread through most of the countries in the Western Hemisphere, Latin America and the Caribbean, including the continental United States. All these areas have something in common: the Aedes aegypti mosquito.  Ae. aegypti mosquitoes can also transmit Chikungunya and dengue viruses. This species is prevalent in Puerto Rico, where temperature, humidity and rainfall make it a perfect place for mosquitoes to breed all year long.  By contrast, in most of the states in the continental U.S., these environmental conditions are met just at the end of spring and during summer (though this is slowly shifting over time, thanks to climate change).  The only state with confirmed local transmission of Zika virus is Florida, and transmission there is occurring in only two areas in Miami-Dade County. Up to Oct. 26, 2016, 180 local related Zika infections have been confirmed.  But it is expected that with the lower temperatures during winter the risk of Zika will also decrease, because mosquitoes need optimal temperatures to reproduce.  Ae. aegypti breeds close to where people live  Ae. aegypti mosquitoes like to feed on people, and often breed in stagnant water in households or in areas near where people live.  In areas without infrastructure to supply water to the entire population or with inappropriate waste management, people may store water in or near their homes or leave waste containers and tires uncovered. This can create more breeding sites for the mosquito. More mosquitoes means more mosquito bites.  In Puerto Rico, Aedes mosquito-breeding sites are mainly used and discarded car tires , which the government is trying to collect to reduce mosquito densities and contain the spread of the virus. Pails, pets’ water bowls and water fountains, for example, also contribute to the problem.  Population growth and internal migration, particularly to unplanned urban areas with poor sanitary conditions, can move more people into areas where Ae. aegypti mosquitoes densities are higher. This is characteristic of Latin America and the Caribbean overall.  In Puerto Rico, as in other tropical areas, window and door screens and air conditioning aren’t as common as they are in the continental U.S. These are considered luxuries for most of the medium and low socioeconomic classes.  Simple things like window screens, use of repellent or air conditioning make a difference.  As part of Zika prevention efforts, the government of Puerto Rico is installing or repairing window and door screens in low-income households with pregnant women and women of childbearing age within the public housing system.     A worker uses a forklift to store abandoned tires at a temporary collection center in San Juan, Jan. 27, 2016.  Alvin Baez/Reuters    Political and cultural factors  The most effective way to prevent mosquito-borne diseases is to control mosquito densities. But mosquito control strategies, such as insecticides and elimination of potential breeding sites, are unsustainable and ineffective in complex transmission settings like Puerto Rico and other tropical areas.  For instance, health officials have known these breeding sites are a major factor in the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses in Puerto Rico for a long time. But efforts to eliminate these sites and control the spread of diseases have not been successful due to multiple environmental and social conditions that make the ideal setting for the mosquito to breed and difficult to control.  In contrast, in the U.S. the mosquito densities are low and the population takes action in doing its own pest and mosquito control, reducing the mosquito populations that can lead to an outbreak.  The fact that mosquito-borne infections are so common in Puerto Rico means that perceived risk from Zika is low . Dengue, for instance, is endemic in Puerto Rico. If Zika is not perceived as a high risk, that means many people do not use repellent or wear long sleeves and long pants as additional protection against mosquito bites.  Puerto Rico’s ongoing economic crisis has weakened the island’s health sector , which can lead late detection of outbreaks, delaying control strategies.  However, the Zika funding bill Congress passed on Sept. 28 allocated money to fight the virus, as well as to support Medicaid and local health centers in Puerto Rico. This funding may help control transmission of the virus (mosquito control) and fund preventative efforts, like vaccine development.  It’s possible to reduce mosquito-borne diseases, even in places where the conditions are ideal for mosquitoes like Ae. aegypti to flourish. Getting rid of standing water – even small amount in flower pots or bird paths – eliminates places where female mosquitoes lay their eggs. Installing window screens and mosquito repellent can keep mosquitoes at bay.

In a statement, the territorial government said there have been only about 10 cases of Zika reported in every four-week period since mid-April, down from more than 8,000 cases in four-week periods at the same time last year.  The announcement seemed to be an attempt by the government of the financially troubled territory to draw a line under an outbreak that has hit the island — in terms of both disease counts and economic fallout — harder than any other part of the United States.  advertisement        Puerto Rico had diagnosed more than 40,000 confirmed cases of Zika infection as of May 20, the most recent date for which data are available. Thirty-eight cases of Zika-induced birth defects have been recorded, although outside experts believe that figure is a substantial underestimate of the problem in the territory.    Related Story:    ‘They’re just hiding’: Experts say Puerto Rico may be underreporting Zika-affected births    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 80 affected pregnancies among 1,579 women infected in pregnancy who have given birth in the U.S. In Puerto Rico, 3,703 women — more than double the U.S. total — were diagnosed with Zika during their pregnancies, but the affected pregnancies number is half that seen in the 50 U.S. states.  STAT reported earlier this spring that U.S. health officials were concerned that Puerto Rico was not counting cases of Zika-related birth defects correctly, the effect of which was to underplay the scale of the problem there.  Concern about the territory’s approach to counting Zika cases strained the relationship between the CDC and Puerto Rico’s department of health, which received CDC grants of $9.5 million to establish and operate a pregnancy registry aimed at charting Zika’s impact on newborns in the territory.  For a time, Puerto Rican officials refused to meet with their CDC counterparts. And last October, CDC stopped reporting Zika figures from Puerto Rico, saying it was not using the agreed-to surveillance criteria to count cases. The CDC still does not report Puerto Rico’s Zika data.  Monday’s statement from Puerto Rico appeared aimed at glossing over the dispute; it made multiple references to how the department of health and the CDC have been working together to manage the outbreak and protect the public.  “In coordination with the CDC, we have put in place a comprehensive program focused on preparation, prevention, precaution and surveillance,” said Dr. Rafael Rodriguez-Mercado, Puerto Rico’s secretary of health. “These efforts can be used as a model for other regions experiencing local Zika virus transmission.”  The CDC declined STAT’s request for an interview regarding Puerto Rico’s announcement. However, the agency sent a written statement from CDC Acting Director Dr. Anne Schuchat, who cautioned against thinking the threat has passed.  “We are pleased that the peak of the Zika virus outbreak in Puerto Rico has come to a close,” Schuchat said. “However, we cannot let our guard down. CDC will continue to focus on protecting pregnant women and work closely with PRDH to‎ support comprehensive Zika surveillance and prevention efforts on the island.”  The CDC is not immediately lifting its advice to pregnant women to avoid travel to the territory.  “CDC is still reviewing recent surveillance data in Puerto Rico to determine if the travel notice can be removed. At this time, there are no plans to change CDC’s travel recommendations for Puerto Rico,” a spokesperson said in an email.  As the Zika virus swept through the Americas last year, the CDC urged pregnant women to avoid travel to a lengthening list of countries and locales where the virus was spreading.  While transmission in a number of these places seems to have abated, the agency has removed very few places from the avoid-while- pregnant list.  Three places — American Samoa, New Caledonia and Saint Barthelemy — were removed from the list after transmission was deemed to have stopped there. And Brazil — which declared its Zika health emergency over in mid-May — also saw a change of status.  Currently low-level transmission is believed to be occurring there; while it no longer qualifies as an epidemic, Zika transmission is now considered endemic in Brazil. But the continued risk of contracting Zika means the CDC still recommends pregnant women avoid travel to Brazil.

Related Story:    ‘They’re just hiding’: Experts say Puerto Rico may be underreporting Zika-affected births    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 80 affected pregnancies among 1,579 women infected in pregnancy who have given birth in the U.S. In Puerto Rico, 3,703 women — more than double the U.S. total — were diagnosed with Zika during their pregnancies, but the affected pregnancies number is half that seen in the 50 U.S. states.  STAT reported earlier this spring that U.S. health officials were concerned that Puerto Rico was not counting cases of Zika-related birth defects correctly, the effect of which was to underplay the scale of the problem there.  Concern about the territory’s approach to counting Zika cases strained the relationship between the CDC and Puerto Rico’s department of health, which received CDC grants of $9.5 million to establish and operate a pregnancy registry aimed at charting Zika’s impact on newborns in the territory.  For a time, Puerto Rican officials refused to meet with their CDC counterparts. And last October, CDC stopped reporting Zika figures from Puerto Rico, saying it was not using the agreed-to surveillance criteria to count cases. The CDC still does not report Puerto Rico’s Zika data.  Monday’s statement from Puerto Rico appeared aimed at glossing over the dispute; it made multiple references to how the department of health and the CDC have been working together to manage the outbreak and protect the public.  “In coordination with the CDC, we have put in place a comprehensive program focused on preparation, prevention, precaution and surveillance,” said Dr. Rafael Rodriguez-Mercado, Puerto Rico’s secretary of health. “These efforts can be used as a model for other regions experiencing local Zika virus transmission.”  The CDC declined STAT’s request for an interview regarding Puerto Rico’s announcement. However, the agency sent a written statement from CDC Acting Director Dr. Anne Schuchat, who cautioned against thinking the threat has passed.  “We are pleased that the peak of the Zika virus outbreak in Puerto Rico has come to a close,” Schuchat said. “However, we cannot let our guard down. CDC will continue to focus on protecting pregnant women and work closely with PRDH to‎ support comprehensive Zika surveillance and prevention efforts on the island.”  The CDC is not immediately lifting its advice to pregnant women to avoid travel to the territory.  “CDC is still reviewing recent surveillance data in Puerto Rico to determine if the travel notice can be removed. At this time, there are no plans to change CDC’s travel recommendations for Puerto Rico,” a spokesperson said in an email.  As the Zika virus swept through the Americas last year, the CDC urged pregnant women to avoid travel to a lengthening list of countries and locales where the virus was spreading.  While transmission in a number of these places seems to have abated, the agency has removed very few places from the avoid-while- pregnant list.  Three places — American Samoa, New Caledonia and Saint Barthelemy — were removed from the list after transmission was deemed to have stopped there. And Brazil — which declared its Zika health emergency over in mid-May — also saw a change of status.  Currently low-level transmission is believed to be occurring there; while it no longer qualifies as an epidemic, Zika transmission is now considered endemic in Brazil. But the continued risk of contracting Zika means the CDC still recommends pregnant women avoid travel to Brazil.

If you listen to the news reports about Zika, you’d think that Puerto Rico was ground zero for the zombie apocalypse .  If you have plans to travel to Puerto Rico you might be concerned. But, before you get all freaked out and start canceling your trip, do a little research, understand the facts, and make an informed decision. People here on the island are still alive and well, and we need tourists more than ever!  If you don’t feel like reading this whole article, just read and understand this part … You should be aware that there is a risk (a very small risk) of getting Zika while on vacation in Puerto Rico. You can reduce that risk even further by applying mosquito repellent with DEET both while indoors and outdoors, wearing long sleeve shirts and long pants, and by keeping doors/windows closed and using air-conditioning.  According to the CDC, the only people that really need to consider canceling their travel plans are pregnant women and those trying to conceive. The CDC guidelines indicate that women in any trimester should avoid travel to destinations with active local Zika virus transmission. The Zika virus can live in semen for months following infection, so men should use a condom during sex if they have been exposed to the Zika virus.  What is Zika?  Zika Virus Disease (or simply Zika ) is a disease caused by the Zika virus (or ZIKV ), which is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Zika virus was first discovered in 1947, and is named after the Zika Forest in Uganda. In 1952, the first human cases of Zika were detected and, since then, outbreaks of Zika have been reported in tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.  In May 2015, the first confirmed Zika cases were reported in Brazil, and it has since spread throughout the Caribbean — including Puerto Rico. In November 2015, the first locally acquired case of Zika was reported in Puerto Rico. The Zika virus may be introduced into areas by travelers who become infected while visiting other areas where the virus exists.  As of June 2016, there have been locally acquired cases of Zika across the Caribbean, throughout Central America, and throughout South America (except Chile and Uruguay). Travel-associated cases of Zika have been reported in all of the US States, except for Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.    How is Zika Virus Spread?  Zika cannot be spread directly from person to person — so you can’t catch it from shaking hands, a sneeze, a doorknob or a toilet seat. ZIKV is spread from person to person by the bite of an infected mosquito. ZIKV is most often spread between people by the by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito.  Here in Puerto Rico, Aedes aegypti is the principal mosquito carrier of Zika virus. This species of mosquito is closely associated with humans and their dwellings. They like to live and breed in a place that is close to their food source — humans — and generally in urban areas, where there are more people available for them to bite! Aedes aegypti prefers to rest in darker cool areas, such as under furniture and in closets — convenient for them to bite people indoors and/or around the household and yard.  The mosquito becomes infected with Zika virus when it bites a person who already has the Zika virus in their blood, A single infected mosquito can infect multiple people, who in turn can infect multiple mosquitoes — and the cycle continues.  What makes Zika more scary than other mosquito-borne disease is that Zika can be passed from a pregnant mother to her fetus, which in turn may cause the baby to have microcephaly or other severe fetal brain defects. Zika can also be spread sexually from an infected male to his sex partners.    What are the Symptoms of Zika?  Only 25% of people infected with the Zika virus will exhibit symptoms, so most people with Zika won’t even know they have it .   Zika is characterized by fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache.  Symptoms typically appear 2 to 12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms are typically mild and last about a week. People usually don’t get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika.  The symptoms of Zika are similar to the symptoms of Chikungunya and Dengue (both which we also have here in Puerto Rico), so it is possible to mis-diagnose the disease.  What is the Treatment for Zika?  See your doctor if you suspect that you have Zika, and tell your doctor that you recently visited the Caribbean.  There is no specific medication for treatment of a Zika infection. People who think they have Zika should use acetaminophen or paracetamol, to relieve fever and pain. They should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and consult a physician. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) should be avoided until dengue can be ruled out.    How to Prevent Zika  There is no vaccination to protect you from Zika. So the way to prevent the virus is to prevent getting bitten by an infected mosquito in the first place.  The adult mosquitoes feed (bite) inside a dwelling as well as outside near their “homes”, during the day and at night when the lights are on. To protect yourself, use mosquito repellent on your skin while indoors or out. When possible, wear long sleeves and pants for additional protection. Also, make sure window and door screens are secure and without holes. If available, use air-conditioning.  Use mosquito spray (Raid Flying Insect, or something similar) in your home and your hotel room. Even though we don’t live in a high Zika area, we still spray dark corners and under the furniture a couple times a day, just as a precaution.  For locals, mosquitoes breed in standing water. If there are any places where water lays around your home or workplace, be sure to dump them on a daily basis. This includes pet water bowls, saucers under plants, buckets and anywhere else water might accumulate. Eliminating places where mosquitoes breed will reduce the number of mosquitoes available to spread dengue. We can all help to break the cycle.    How Widespread is Zika in Puerto Rico?  Contrary to what the new media would have you believe, Zika is not the black plague here on the island. If you look at the most recent statistics (18 November 2016) from the Puerto Rico Department of Health, there were 2705 new cases of Zika confirmed in the past 2 weeks, bringing the total to 34060 cases of Zika confirmed since the beginning of 2016. That’s about 9.7% of the population .  Those cases are primarily concentrated in the San Juan metro area, the Ponce area, and the Arecibo area. There are cases in all municipalities on the island.  You are not likely to catch Zika at the beach, in the rain forest, on a bio bay tour or on a snorkeling tour — as these are just not places that are that hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito. But remember, no matter where you go or what you do, you might want to take precautions to reduce your chances of getting Zika. I feel it is better to be safe than sorry.

The C.D.C. on Friday recommended a waiting period for couples exposed to the virus who would like to become pregnant.   Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times     Federal health authorities said for the first time on Friday how long couples who have been exposed to the Zika virus should wait before trying to get pregnant. The officials, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that they had decided to recommend a waiting period based on the latest information about the science of the virus. The Zika virus has been linked to a surge of birth defects in Brazil , and to cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which a person’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system, leading to some paralysis .     Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus  Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.             Women who have had symptoms of the virus or tested positive for it should wait at least eight weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant, the agency said. Officials recommended that men who had symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex. The virus has been known to live longer in semen. Symptoms can include rashes and sore joints. “We’re learning more every day, and evidence of a link between Zika and a spectrum of birth outcomes is becoming stronger and stronger,” said Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C.D.C.’s Zika virus response team .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She added, “We’ve become more concerned” about the period around the time of conception. “For people who either have the Zika disease or who travel to an area with active Zika transmission, we are now recommending they wait a period of time before trying to get pregnant.”     Zika Virus Rumors and Theories That You Should Doubt  Here is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.             For people who have traveled to Zika-infected areas, but had no active signs of the disease, the C.D.C. recommended a shorter waiting period — eight weeks for men and women before trying to get pregnant “in order to minimize risk.”  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Dr. Jamieson said the C.D.C. based the waiting times on the longest known risk period and “allowed three times the longest period,” out of an abundance of caution. The situation is trickiest for men and women who live in areas where Zika is circulating. C.D.C. officials recommended that doctors talk with their patients about the risks of the virus, but stopped short of recommending that women delay pregnancy . ( Several countries outside the United States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Jamaica, have in recent months at least suggested that women postpone getting pregnant for indefinite or varying periods of time. El Salvador has recommended that women wait until 2018.)

For men with pregnant partners who travel to a Zika-infected area, the recommendation remains the same: Use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. Condoms should be used for vaginal, anal and oral sex. The agency said the waiting periods for men also applied to how to avoid sexual transmission of the Zika virus to their partners after they had traveled to Zika-infected areas, a phenomenon that is more common than scientists once thought. Men with symptoms should consider using condoms or not having sex for at least six months. For men without symptoms, the period was eight weeks. The agency also estimated that about 138,000 women in Puerto Rico are not using birth control that is effective, and may be at risk of unintended pregnancy.

Greg Allen/NPR  hide caption    toggle caption   Greg Allen/NPR          Mosquito larvae fill the cup of stale water that entomologist Luis Hernandez dips from a stack of old tires in a suburb of San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Greg Allen/NPR     The Zika virus is a health threat not just to Latin America, but also to parts of the U.S. It's already a problem in Puerto Rico where there are nearly 120 cases so far, including five pregnant women. That's a concern, because Zika may be involved in causing birth defects .  The U.S. territory has declared a public health emergency and is working to protect residents from Zika and from the primary mosquito that carries the disease, Aedes aegypti . The species is largely responsible for the spread of Zika and many other tropical diseases, including yellow fever and dengue. It can breed anywhere it finds as little as a teaspoonful of standing water.  In Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities, emergency crews are looking for the places the mosquitoes breed. In Guaynabo, a suburb of Puerto Rico's capital San Juan, Luis Hernandez gets out of his truck to take a look at some old tires piled outside a home. Hernandez is an entomologist who advises local authorities on how to combat the A. aegypti .     He dips a cup into one of the tires and shows me what's inside. A dozen or more mosquito larvae wriggle in the water.  "That means this tire has been here for more than one week," Hernandez says. "Because of the size of the larvae, I know how long the tire's been here."  There are dumps of old tires from automobiles and trucks everywhere in Puerto Rico. That's because the recycling fees customers pay when they purchase tires don't cover the actual cost of disposal. Tires pile up and they become breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  Puerto Rico's legislature has passed an emergency measure to pay the cost of picking up and recycling tires. In Guaynabo, emergency response crews have already started collecting the tires, sending a grapple truck to clean up 15 sites in the municipality.  Crews are also working to remove standing water around schools, abandoned houses and even cemeteries, where flower vases can serve as mosquito breeding areas.      Shots - Health News  With CDC Help, Puerto Rico Aims To Get Ahead Of Zika        Unsealed septic tanks can also be a problem. Crews will inspect and install screens over vents where they're needed.  Puerto Rico's governor wants this work done in 45 days, before the start of the rainy season.  In Guaynabo, no cases of Zika have been reported yet. But long before most people had heard of Zika, Guaynabo was dealing with another tropical disease — dengue. It's sometimes called bonebreak fever , and can lead to death.  "We had many, many cases. Dengue was really hard here," says Dr. Silvia Medina, Guaynabo's former health director. Medina is helping Guaynabo now as a consultant, taking charts, pictures and information about Zika out to the community. She did something similar during the last dengue outbreak.  "We went into the communities, school, churches — everywhere," Medina says. "We had good results. When people are educated, they're healthy people."  As part of the public health emergency, Puerto Rico is asking all residents to check their homes and the homes of their neighbors for standing water and mosquitoes. A big problem in Puerto Rico is that most homes aren't air conditioned and many lack screens, so residents are exposed to more mosquitoes.  Hernandez says fumigation trucks respond quickly when crews get calls from areas where there are lots of mosquitoes. But A. aegypti mosquitoes spend much of their time indoors, Hernandez says, so aerial spraying is often not effective. And when the fumigation trucks begin spraying in a neighborhood, residents often close their windows, he says.  Hernandez throws up his hands in frustration. "If the mosquito is inside with you, and you close the window," he says, you and your family may still be bitten.  The Obama administration has asked Congress for more than $200 million to help Puerto Rico protect residents. Dr. Johnny Rullan is a former Puerto Rico secretary of health who is advising the government on its Zika response. After outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya and now Zika, Rullan says, it's clear Puerto Rico has to get serious about protecting residents from A. aegypti.  "We will have to do like we did for yellow fever," he says. "We declared war on yellow fever and Puerto Rico was successful. We have declared war now on the Aedes aegypti mosquito and we need to win it."  Puerto Rico is scrambling to adopt mosquito control measures in the next six weeks, before the rainy season begins. Rullan says these are measures that the island should already have put in place — over the last 30 years.     microcephaly  Zika virus  Guillain-Barre syndrome  mosquitoes  dengue fever  Puerto Rico       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

Press Release  Embargoed Until: Friday, July 29, 2016 11:00 a.m. EDT Contact:  Media Relations (404) 639-3286   As of July 7, Zika has been diagnosed in 5,582* people, including 672 pregnant women, in Puerto Rico according to a new report published today in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ). Positive tests for people with suspected Zika virus infection have increased from 14 percent in February to 64 percent in June. Positive tests through blood supply screening also increased, reaching 1.8 percent during the latest week of reporting starting July 3.  “Puerto Rico is in the midst of a Zika epidemic. The virus is silently and rapidly spreading in Puerto Rico,” said Lyle R. Petersen, M.D., M.P.H, Incident Manager for CDC’s Zika Response and Director, Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. “This could lead to hundreds of infants being born with microcephaly or other birth defects in the coming year. We must do all we can to protect pregnant women from Zika and to prepare to care for infants born with microcephaly.”  Many of the 5,582 people who tested positive for Zika virus infections were tested because they had symptoms of Zika. Because Zika infection during pregnancy can harm the developing fetus, pregnant women in Puerto Rico and other areas where Zika is spreading should be routinely tested during prenatal care whether or not they got sick. Of the 672 pregnant women, 441 (66 percent) experienced symptoms of Zika and 231 (34 percent) had no symptoms. Because approximately 80 percent of people infected with Zika do not have symptoms, the 672 pregnant women with evidence of Zika infection likely represent only a fraction of those who may be infected to date.  In addition, 21 people with confirmed or suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome in Puerto Rico had evidence of Zika virus infection or recent unspecified flavivirus infection, and one person died after developing severe thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count).  Since local transmission of Zika virus was first reported in Puerto Rico in December 2015, it has become widespread on the island. People in 77 of 78 municipalities have tested positive for Zika virus infection. Large urban areas are most severely affected, with the largest numbers of diagnosed residents in the San Juan metropolitan area followed by the Ponce and Caguas metropolitan areas.  Outbreaks of mosquito-borne viruses tend to peak in the late summer and fall in Puerto Rico—hotter months with higher rainfall—raising concern that Zika will continue to spread and increase in the coming months. At the current trend, hundreds to thousands more pregnant women in Puerto Rico could become infected with Zika by the end of the year. There is also risk for more Guillain-Barré syndrome cases associated with Zika virus infection. The situation in Puerto Rico warrants urgent, comprehensive action to protect pregnant women:   The government of Puerto Rico and its municipalities can promote an integrated mosquito management program that includes reducing places with water where mosquitoes lay eggs, keeping mosquitoes out of houses with screens on windows and doors, and reducing the number of mosquitoes by using EPA-approved products. Everyone can follow these steps to help reduce the number of mosquitoes in and around homes.  People who live in or travel to Puerto Rico should avoid mosquito bites by using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, and staying indoors in places with screens and air conditioning to the greatest extent possible.  Pregnant women and their partners should use condoms and other barriers to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus, or not have sex throughout the pregnancy.  Couples who want to prevent or delay pregnancy should talk to their healthcare provider about safe and effective contraceptive methods.  Clinicians who suspect Zika in patients who live in or have recently returned from areas with Zika, such as Puerto Rico, should report cases to public health officials.   CDC is working with Puerto Rico to provide services to protect pregnant women from Zika, support pregnant women who have been infected with Zika, increase lab testing, improve mosquito control, and provide access to contraception for women who choose to delay or avoid pregnancy.  * CDC only publishes data on our website that has been provided through ArboNET.

Marisa Penaloza/NPR     Micaela Delgado is a beautiful dark-eyed baby girl with a ready smile. She's 8 months old. She's one of more than 1,000 babies already born in Puerto Rico to mothers with Zika.  Her mother, Yalieth Gonzalez, 22, says despite all her worries, so far Micaela's development appears normal. "She's very active, she's up on her own now, she's crawling," Gonzalez says. "She's saying, 'mama' and 'papa' already. She's a very happy baby. She has a lot of energy." But Gonzalez is on alert for signs of trouble.  Gonzalez doesn't know how she got Zika, which is spread by mosquitoes. She was just three months pregnant when she had symptoms and went to the hospital. Doctors monitored her baby's development with regular ultrasounds and warned her about the possibility of birth defects.  The worst part of her pregnancy was her delivery. Gonzalez says she was in labor for 22 long, agonizing hours and she spent that time worrying. "'What would I do if she was born with health problems?' I thought. I was young. What would my life be like? I wanted to see her, but at the same time, I was scared, scared of how I would feel if she was born with medical problems."     Since Zika appeared in Puerto Rico more than a year ago, doctors believe as many as a million people on the island have been infected. Some 40,000 of those cases have been confirmed , a number that includes some 3,200 pregnant women. Doctors in Puerto Rico are just beginning to assess the long-term consequences for children born to mothers with Zika.  Yalieth Gonzalez was treated at the High Risk Pregnancy Clinic at the University of Puerto Rico's hospital. Dr. Alberto de la Vega has seen one-fifth of the pregnant women on the island who tested positive for Zika. "Among those patients we've had at least 14 or 15 confirmed cases in which severe brain damage, caused by the Zika virus, has occurred," he says.  Some of those cases included microcephaly .  For babies born to mothers infected in the first trimester, de la Vega says the risk of brain damage is between 2 and 4 percent. But he's seeing many other problems in his patients infected with Zika, including mothers going into premature labor and a higher number of miscarriages.  What worries him most is that even in cases where babies appear normal, their brains show lagging growth. "What does that mean in terms of future development? No one has an idea," he says. "If you have a condition that can cause severe brain damage, it's not going to be an either-or situation. There has to be a spectrum of problems that are yet to be defined."  De la Vega and other doctors are also concerned about young children who contract Zika after birth, at a time when their brains are still actively developing. Puerto Rico's Health Department plans to monitor these children for three to five years.  Many are being seen at the University of Puerto Rico by Dr. Carmen Zorrilla . She runs the Maternal Infant Studies Center at the University of Puerto Rico hospital, which was established 30 years ago to help women living with HIV.  Zika, she says, presents some of the same challenges for pregnant women.  Zorrilla also compares the impact of Zika with that of rubella , which caused birth defects in tens of thousands of children in the U.S. until a vaccine was discovered in the late 1960s.      Shots - Health News  Lessons From Rubella Suggest Zika's Impact Could Linger        Years later, Zorrilla says, researchers checked back with adults who had been born to mothers infected with rubella but who appeared normal at birth. "They found an increased rate of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in these people who were exposed to rubella while they were in utero," she says. "So, it's not until 20 years from now that we might say, 'Oh, Zika caused this or that.'"  With the rainy season approaching, the time when disease-carrying mosquitoes become active, Zorrilla worries many on the island have become complacent. One problem, she says, is that women who have babies with birth defects have been reluctant to go public because, like HIV, Zika carries a stigma.  Zorrilla has heard comments like, "Oh, you were not protecting yourself?," "You were not using the mosquito repellent?" or "You were not using condoms?"  "You have pregnant women with a viral disease that may cause birth defects which is serious," Zorrilla says. "And then you're blaming them for getting it."  That's how Yalieth Gonzalez felt when she found out she was infected with Zika. Concerned she would be judged, at first, she only shared the news with her mother and the baby's father.  Her daughter Micaela sees the pediatrician every month to check her development, head size and other benchmarks. Doctors are also monitoring the baby's vision and hearing. It all looks good now, but it could be years before any anomalies are identified.  It was only after Micaela was born that Gonzalez says she felt strong enough to share her story with friends. "People should know that Zika is real. I was lucky that my baby was born healthy. There are many people in Puerto Rico who don't take Zika seriously, and we should," she says.  Epidemiologists expect to see fewer cases in Puerto Rico this year than last, but the disease is now endemic on the island. That means, until a vaccine is available, Zika will continue to pose a risk for women who become pregnant, and for their babies.     zika  pregnant women  brain damage  birth defects  Puerto Rico       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Shots  Health News From NPR          Shots  Health News From NPR         About     Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

This public health message was part of an island-wide effort to stem the spread of Zika.  Angel Valentin/Getty Images     The number of new Zika cases in Puerto Rico has dropped dramatically in recent weeks, yet health officials worry the full effect of the outbreak on the island may not be known for months or years to come.  Puerto Rico has confirmed more than 34,000 Zika infections since the virus was first detected on the island in November 2015.  Tyler M. Sharp, acting head of epidemiology at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Dengue Branch in San Juan, says the outbreak peaked during the summer.  "In mid-August we were at more than 2,000 [confirmed] lab cases per week coming in," Sharp says. "Now we are at a little over 200 per week, so the numbers are down from where they were at the worst part of the outbreak. But there is continued transmission, so there's continued risk both to pregnant women and everybody else who's present on the island."  Sharp says that compared with other mosquito-borne outbreaks, such as chikungunya or dengue, the spread of Zika in the U.S. territory this year was huge.     "The number of Zika virus disease cases that we've documented in Puerto Rico in the last year is substantially larger than we've seen for any dengue epidemic in the last ..." he pauses to ponder how long, "Well, ever."  That's in part because dengue has been circulating in the territory for decades.  "Many people in Puerto Rico have immunity against dengue," Sharp explains. "When Zika was introduced nobody had immunity, so effectively everybody was susceptible."      Zika Virus  Puerto Rico Health Official 'Very Concerned' About Zika's Spread        The tricky thing about Zika is that most people who get infected have mild cases; some don't have any symptoms at all. But the virus has also been linked to neurological problems, including severe birth defects such as microcephaly .  Health officials' greatest concern about Zika has been its potential effect on pregnant women and their developing fetuses. More than 2,600 pregnant women on the island have tested positive for Zika infections. Dr. Brenda Rivera, the territorial epidemiologist with the Puerto Rico Department of Health, says among those pregnancies only a handful of fetal abnormalities have been confirmed. Most of those were seen in pregnancies that were aborted or didn't go all the way to term.  "We still don't know what the implications are of having been infected during pregnancy," she says. "We still don't know if you're going to show developmental problems later on. You might be normal at birth with normal head circumference, no overt structural abnormalities but what developmental problems we might see in these kids later on, that's still a question that hasn't been satisfactorily answered."  A study out of Brazil published Nov. 22 found that some babies exposed to Zika in the womb and who weren't born with microcephaly ended up developing it later on. Those children however did show abnormalities on brain scans at birth.  Researchers and health officials, including Rivera in Puerto Rico, say huge questions about this virus and its effects on pregnancy remain.  Even though transmission of Zika appears to have peaked in Puerto Rico, Rivera says the real work of figuring this disease out lies ahead. She and her colleagues have their eyes on more than 2,600 pregnancies. "About half of those are still ongoing," she says. "So there's a lot that we still need to monitor, and our intent is to monitor the children of these pregnancies for up to three years to better understand the scope of the disease."

In August, at the peak of the epidemic in the US territory, the US Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency when the number of cases there surpassed 10,000, including more than 1,000 pregnant women. But there have only been 10 new cases reported since the end of April, according to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Zika in Puerto Rico now a public health emergency The mosquito-borne disease, which is also sexually transmitted, is of greatest concern to pregnant women and those trying to become pregnant and their partners because of the devastating consequences it can have on a fetus. 1 in 10 Zika-infected US moms have babies with birth defects, CDC reports As of May 20, the most recent data available, the Puerto Rico Department of Health reported (PDF) 40,330 confirmed cases of the Zika virus since the outbreak began last year. Four hundred twenty-two of those infected have been hospitalized, and five individuals have died. Among those cases, there have been 52 Zika-related cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome , a type of temporary paralysis that is caused by viruses including Zika. The Puerto Rico Department of Health has reported only 38 cases of Zika-related birth defects.

"While there are very low levels of mosquito-borne Zika transmission now, it is important that we remain vigilant to keep these numbers down and support families already affected by Zika," State Epidemiologist Dr. Carmen Deseda said in a news release Monday announcing the end of the epidemic. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention echoed the need for continued vigilance. Its recommendation that pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant not travel to areas with Zika, including Puerto Rico, remains in effect. Due to the continued risk of Zika, the agency said the Health and Human Services public health emergency declaration, which was renewed at the end of April, also remains in effect. That declaration is set to expire at the end of July.

An update on last year’s epidemic—before you book your spring break travels.   By Nikki Ekstein  @nikkiekstein  More stories by Nikki Ekstein       February 8, 2017, 10:47 AM EST                    The Zika Virus Explained in Two Minutes      It’s been more than a year since the Centers for Disease Control issued the first warning about travel to Brazil and the Caribbean because of the Zika virus. From January to August of last year, the virus dominated headlines and sent travel agents and hoteliers into a frenzy. Hotels in Zika zones like the St. Regis Puerto Rico saw business losses as great as 30 percent, while an unprecedented boom brought twice as many travelers to a flurry of resorts in Zika-free Hawaii. But for the last few months, Zika has been out of sight and out of mind. Does that mean you should stop worrying about it? Here’s what the experts have to say.  The Bad News Fighting Zika with pesticide spraying in Miami Beach. Photographer: Joe Raedle/Getty Images      Zika was never eradicated from the 30 Caribbean islands and 18 countries in South America where it appeared last year, and the disease is now showing up everywhere from Southeast Asia to the South Pacific. But you haven’t been hearing about Zika lately because, for one, it&apos;s winter, when mosquitoes don’t thrive. And the U.S. presidential election has dominated air waves since the Rio Olympics finished virus-free last August, leaving the story to simmer (very softly) on the back burner. And yet, between the months of November and January, the CDC has logged almost 4,000 new cases of Zika in the U.S., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. “The disease as we understand it now is scarier than we originally thought,” said Kristin Lamoureux, associate dean of New York University&apos;s Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. “It’s not quite the same as SARS or Ebola or other diseases that are contained geographically,” she explained, adding that other mosquito-borne diseases (like malaria or dengue fever) carry less stigma because they’re known to be curable. “We know we’re going to see Zika again in the spring,” she said. The Good News The St. Regis in Puerto Rico, where tourism has started to rebound. Source: The St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort, Puerto Rico Miami has served as a useful case study. When the city saw its first few cases of Zika transmission last summer, the local government acted quickly, enforcing a tripartite strategy of aerial spraying, manual spraying, and local awareness that eradicated the disease. “Miami Beach is a beacon of hope that Zika can be contained,” said Lamoureux, who added that other destinations can replicate the same model to contain outbreaks, or even prevent them, if they have the organizational means and resources to do so.      Other locales have managed to stay blissfully free of Zika altogether. Bermuda has never appeared on the CDC Travel Notice list, and neither have Uruguay, Chile, and Hawaii. And there’s compelling evidence that Puerto Rico has curtailed the number of cases dramatically. Even better, according to former Food and Drug Administration chief and public health expert Dr. Jesse Goodman, nearly a dozen Zika vaccines are currently in trial phases, and at least one of them is entering early human studies. When that happens, Zika will be no different than malaria: a mosquito-borne virus that can be reliably combated whenever exposure puts you at risk. But a safe and effective vaccine is still a few years away. Until then, Goodman, who has sat on boards and committees for the CDC, National Institutes of Health, and World Health Organization, sees Zika becoming endemic, just like malaria, chikungunya, and dengue. “My suspicion is that over a period of a couple of years, the people most exposed to Zika will become immune to it—which will make the rates of infection go down a lot,” he said. Goodman’s advice: If you have a destination in mind for your next trip, sign up for text alerts from the CDC here to get the most up-to-the-minute information.  What Now? Adult mosquitoes as seen under a microscope. Photographer: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images The link between Zika and microcephaly may have been called into question last fall by a story in the Washington Post , which claimed that the correlation has primarily been limited to a small area in northern Brazil. But Goodman says the science is clear. “The scientific community has come to a consensus that there’s a clear risk between Zika and microcephaly,” he told Bloomberg, “along with a variety of other severe pregnancy outcomes, in some cases including miscarriages.” For women in their first trimester, the risk of incidence has been estimated at 15 percent to 20 percent, he says. And while that’s not small, early studies had pinned the numbers as being higher. (The correlation between Zika and Guillain-Barré syndrome is still much, much smaller: Only 13 of the 4,973 Americans who have contracted Zika got the autoimmune disorder.) What’s less clear, said Goodman, is whether gestational Zika can lead to other pediatric conditions like learning disabilities, and why microcephaly has been so much more prevalent in some regions (like northern Brazil) than others. All things considered, he says the recommendation is still that “pregnant women and women looking to get pregnant avoid all nonessential travel, or get tested during their pregnancy if they’ve been exposed.” For many travelers, exposure to Zika is bound to become something of an inevitability. “The comfort level for travelers has risen [when it comes to going to the Caribbean] now that Zika has been out of the conversation for a while,” said luxury travel specialist Jack Ezon of Ovation Travel. Business was up 43 percent in the Caribbean and Mexico last month, and spring break bookings are almost back to their normal volume after dipping by up to 30 percent in 2016. “Only 15 percent of travelers are even asking about Zika anymore, compared to about 70 percent last year,” Ezon added. “What we are noticing is more of a wait-and-see approach,” he said, pointing to a spike in last-minute warm weather trips; likely, travelers want to feel as confident as possible that another Zika outbreak isn’t on the horizon. To that, we say: Avoid the beach at twilight, dawn, and dusk. Pack the chicest coverup you own, and wear it often. Request a room on your hotel’s higher floors. And don&apos;t forget your bug spray .      Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.   LEARN MORE     Have a confidential news tip? Get in touch with our reporters.

A pickup truck from the Department of Health fumigates in San Juan, Jan. 27, 2016. Alvin Baez/Reuters         Email     Twitter     Facebook     LinkedIn     WhatsApp     Messenger       The United States declared Zika a public health emergency in Puerto Rico in August 2016.  Over 28,000 cases of Zika were reported in Puerto Rico as of Oct. 26. In contrast, just over 4,000 cases of Zika were reported in the continental U.S. and Hawaii by the same date. Most of these cases are travel-related, meaning that people are infected while abroad. But in Puerto Rico, 98 percent of Zika cases are locally acquired. It is estimated that up 80 percent of people who are infected with Zika are asymptomatic, which means that reported cases may be just a fraction of those who may be infected.  The U.S. Surgeon General said that one in four Puerto Ricans could be infected by the end of the year. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 5,900 to 10,300 pregnant women might get infected during the initial Zika outbreak in Puerto Rico. In the absence of effective interventions like birth control or mosquito control, about 100 to 270 infants may be born with Zika-related microcephaly from mid-2016 to mid-2017.  So why is Zika so much worse in Puerto Rico than in the continental U.S.?  Mosquito-borne diseases are complex. Environmental, social, political and cultural factors can influence their transmission. And Puerto Rico, like other parts of the Caribbean and Latin America, has the perfect mix of conditions for a mosquito borne virus to spread widely.     A health worker prepares insecticide before fumigating a neighborhood in San Juan, Jan. 27, 2016.  Alvin Baez/Files/Reuters    Environmental factors  Since the Zika virus was identified in Brazil, it has spread through most of the countries in the Western Hemisphere, Latin America and the Caribbean, including the continental United States. All these areas have something in common: the Aedes aegypti mosquito.  Ae. aegypti mosquitoes can also transmit Chikungunya and dengue viruses. This species is prevalent in Puerto Rico, where temperature, humidity and rainfall make it a perfect place for mosquitoes to breed all year long.  By contrast, in most of the states in the continental U.S., these environmental conditions are met just at the end of spring and during summer (though this is slowly shifting over time, thanks to climate change).  The only state with confirmed local transmission of Zika virus is Florida, and transmission there is occurring in only two areas in Miami-Dade County. Up to Oct. 26, 2016, 180 local related Zika infections have been confirmed.  But it is expected that with the lower temperatures during winter the risk of Zika will also decrease, because mosquitoes need optimal temperatures to reproduce.  Ae. aegypti breeds close to where people live  Ae. aegypti mosquitoes like to feed on people, and often breed in stagnant water in households or in areas near where people live.  In areas without infrastructure to supply water to the entire population or with inappropriate waste management, people may store water in or near their homes or leave waste containers and tires uncovered. This can create more breeding sites for the mosquito. More mosquitoes means more mosquito bites.  In Puerto Rico, Aedes mosquito-breeding sites are mainly used and discarded car tires , which the government is trying to collect to reduce mosquito densities and contain the spread of the virus. Pails, pets’ water bowls and water fountains, for example, also contribute to the problem.  Population growth and internal migration, particularly to unplanned urban areas with poor sanitary conditions, can move more people into areas where Ae. aegypti mosquitoes densities are higher. This is characteristic of Latin America and the Caribbean overall.  In Puerto Rico, as in other tropical areas, window and door screens and air conditioning aren’t as common as they are in the continental U.S. These are considered luxuries for most of the medium and low socioeconomic classes.  Simple things like window screens, use of repellent or air conditioning make a difference.  As part of Zika prevention efforts, the government of Puerto Rico is installing or repairing window and door screens in low-income households with pregnant women and women of childbearing age within the public housing system.     A worker uses a forklift to store abandoned tires at a temporary collection center in San Juan, Jan. 27, 2016.  Alvin Baez/Reuters    Political and cultural factors  The most effective way to prevent mosquito-borne diseases is to control mosquito densities. But mosquito control strategies, such as insecticides and elimination of potential breeding sites, are unsustainable and ineffective in complex transmission settings like Puerto Rico and other tropical areas.  For instance, health officials have known these breeding sites are a major factor in the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses in Puerto Rico for a long time. But efforts to eliminate these sites and control the spread of diseases have not been successful due to multiple environmental and social conditions that make the ideal setting for the mosquito to breed and difficult to control.  In contrast, in the U.S. the mosquito densities are low and the population takes action in doing its own pest and mosquito control, reducing the mosquito populations that can lead to an outbreak.  The fact that mosquito-borne infections are so common in Puerto Rico means that perceived risk from Zika is low . Dengue, for instance, is endemic in Puerto Rico. If Zika is not perceived as a high risk, that means many people do not use repellent or wear long sleeves and long pants as additional protection against mosquito bites.  Puerto Rico’s ongoing economic crisis has weakened the island’s health sector , which can lead late detection of outbreaks, delaying control strategies.  However, the Zika funding bill Congress passed on Sept. 28 allocated money to fight the virus, as well as to support Medicaid and local health centers in Puerto Rico. This funding may help control transmission of the virus (mosquito control) and fund preventative efforts, like vaccine development.  It’s possible to reduce mosquito-borne diseases, even in places where the conditions are ideal for mosquitoes like Ae. aegypti to flourish. Getting rid of standing water – even small amount in flower pots or bird paths – eliminates places where female mosquitoes lay their eggs. Installing window screens and mosquito repellent can keep mosquitoes at bay.

Carlos Giusti/AP        Twitter  Facebook  LinkedIn  Email  Doximity  Republish  Print       P  uerto Rico declared its Zika epidemic over on Monday, saying transmission of the virus on the island has fallen to relatively low levels.  In a statement, the territorial government said there have been only about 10 cases of Zika reported in every four-week period since mid-April, down from more than 8,000 cases in four-week periods at the same time last year.  The announcement seemed to be an attempt by the government of the financially troubled territory to draw a line under an outbreak that has hit the island — in terms of both disease counts and economic fallout — harder than any other part of the United States.  advertisement        Puerto Rico had diagnosed more than 40,000 confirmed cases of Zika infection as of May 20, the most recent date for which data are available. Thirty-eight cases of Zika-induced birth defects have been recorded, although outside experts believe that figure is a substantial underestimate of the problem in the territory.    Related Story:    ‘They’re just hiding’: Experts say Puerto Rico may be underreporting Zika-affected births    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 80 affected pregnancies among 1,579 women infected in pregnancy who have given birth in the U.S. In Puerto Rico, 3,703 women — more than double the U.S. total — were diagnosed with Zika during their pregnancies, but the affected pregnancies number is half that seen in the 50 U.S. states.  STAT reported earlier this spring that U.S. health officials were concerned that Puerto Rico was not counting cases of Zika-related birth defects correctly, the effect of which was to underplay the scale of the problem there.  Concern about the territory’s approach to counting Zika cases strained the relationship between the CDC and Puerto Rico’s department of health, which received CDC grants of $9.5 million to establish and operate a pregnancy registry aimed at charting Zika’s impact on newborns in the territory.  For a time, Puerto Rican officials refused to meet with their CDC counterparts. And last October, CDC stopped reporting Zika figures from Puerto Rico, saying it was not using the agreed-to surveillance criteria to count cases. The CDC still does not report Puerto Rico’s Zika data.  Monday’s statement from Puerto Rico appeared aimed at glossing over the dispute; it made multiple references to how the department of health and the CDC have been working together to manage the outbreak and protect the public.  “In coordination with the CDC, we have put in place a comprehensive program focused on preparation, prevention, precaution and surveillance,” said Dr. Rafael Rodriguez-Mercado, Puerto Rico’s secretary of health. “These efforts can be used as a model for other regions experiencing local Zika virus transmission.”  The CDC declined STAT’s request for an interview regarding Puerto Rico’s announcement. However, the agency sent a written statement from CDC Acting Director Dr. Anne Schuchat, who cautioned against thinking the threat has passed.  “We are pleased that the peak of the Zika virus outbreak in Puerto Rico has come to a close,” Schuchat said. “However, we cannot let our guard down. CDC will continue to focus on protecting pregnant women and work closely with PRDH to‎ support comprehensive Zika surveillance and prevention efforts on the island.”  The CDC is not immediately lifting its advice to pregnant women to avoid travel to the territory.  “CDC is still reviewing recent surveillance data in Puerto Rico to determine if the travel notice can be removed. At this time, there are no plans to change CDC’s travel recommendations for Puerto Rico,” a spokesperson said in an email.  As the Zika virus swept through the Americas last year, the CDC urged pregnant women to avoid travel to a lengthening list of countries and locales where the virus was spreading.  While transmission in a number of these places seems to have abated, the agency has removed very few places from the avoid-while- pregnant list.  Three places — American Samoa, New Caledonia and Saint Barthelemy — were removed from the list after transmission was deemed to have stopped there. And Brazil — which declared its Zika health emergency over in mid-May — also saw a change of status.  Currently low-level transmission is believed to be occurring there; while it no longer qualifies as an epidemic, Zika transmission is now considered endemic in Brazil. But the continued risk of contracting Zika means the CDC still recommends pregnant women avoid travel to Brazil.

In a statement, the territorial government said there have been only about 10 cases of Zika reported in every four-week period since mid-April, down from more than 8,000 cases in four-week periods at the same time last year.  The announcement seemed to be an attempt by the government of the financially troubled territory to draw a line under an outbreak that has hit the island — in terms of both disease counts and economic fallout — harder than any other part of the United States.  advertisement        Puerto Rico had diagnosed more than 40,000 confirmed cases of Zika infection as of May 20, the most recent date for which data are available. Thirty-eight cases of Zika-induced birth defects have been recorded, although outside experts believe that figure is a substantial underestimate of the problem in the territory.    Related Story:    ‘They’re just hiding’: Experts say Puerto Rico may be underreporting Zika-affected births    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 80 affected pregnancies among 1,579 women infected in pregnancy who have given birth in the U.S. In Puerto Rico, 3,703 women — more than double the U.S. total — were diagnosed with Zika during their pregnancies, but the affected pregnancies number is half that seen in the 50 U.S. states.  STAT reported earlier this spring that U.S. health officials were concerned that Puerto Rico was not counting cases of Zika-related birth defects correctly, the effect of which was to underplay the scale of the problem there.  Concern about the territory’s approach to counting Zika cases strained the relationship between the CDC and Puerto Rico’s department of health, which received CDC grants of $9.5 million to establish and operate a pregnancy registry aimed at charting Zika’s impact on newborns in the territory.
