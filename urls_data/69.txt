A new study has found that the chance of finding love on a given day is just 1 in 562 if you leave it entirely to fate. But the good news is that there are several things you can do to improve those odds, including saying yes to after-work drinks, and joining online dating services. Scroll down for video          A new study by researchers, including celebrity mathematician, Rachel Riley, has found that the chance of finding love on a given day is just 1 in 562 if you leave it entirely to fate   ACTIONS THAT IMPROVE YOUR CHANCE OF FINDING LOVE Factor  People added to dating pool monthly on average  Positive impact on odds    Meeting people via online dating site  8  17%    Meeting colleagues and friends of colleagues  6  16%    Talking to people at the gym  7  15%    Meeting people through shared hobbies/societies  5  11%    Talking to people at clubs/bars  4  9%    Meeting friends of friends  2  4%    Being set up by family members  0.4  1%    Talking to people in the gym was found to improve your odds of meeting 'the one' by 15 per cent. Saying yes to after-work drinks boosted your chance by 16 per cent. The biggest boost to your odds was found to be meeting people via online dating, with a 17 per cent jump. Meeting friends of friends (four per cent) and being set up by family members (one per cent) were found to be the least effective routes to finding love. The researchers, from the University of Bath, calculated the odds of falling in love with the help of celebrity mathematician Rachel Riley. The researchers based their calculations on 18 key factors, including your location, desired age, physical attractiveness and relationship status. Sadly, they found that just 84,440 people in the UK fit the average person's romantic requirements from an adult population of over 47 million. This is the equivalent of just one in in 562. Ms Riley said: 'When it comes down to it, love really is a numbers game.    RELATED ARTICLES   Previous  1  Next        Why onions make us cry: Researchers uncover the chemistry...

'But, as our data suggests, the odds of love can drastically diminish when we get too prescriptive about age, location, looks, and even pet preferences!' Analysing their results further, the researchers, who worked with eHarmony as part of the study, found that the biggest impact on your chances of finding love is age. The average UK singleton is most likely to be looking for a partner aged between 35 and 47.          The researchers found that just 84,440 people in the UK fit the average person's romantic requirements from an adult population of over 47 million (stock image) And according to figures from the Office of National Statistics, that leaves just 17 per cent of the population as an option. Physical attraction was second in importance, which was uncovered by a photo gallery experiment. Researchers asked members of the public to rate images of a variety of people based on looks.          Saying yes to after work drinks was found to open up a pool of around 75 new people, increasing your chance of finding someone compatible by 16 per cent (stock image)  KEY FINDINGS - 84,440 people in the UK fit the average person's romantic requirements from an adult population of over 47 million - The average UK singleton is most likely to be looking for a partner aged between 35 and 47 - The rate we are mutually attracted to people is 18 per cent - The age group with the best odds were 65-74 year-olds, who have a one in 304 chance - The age group with the toughest odds is 18-24 year-olds, who face chances of meeting the one of just one in 1,024 - Those in more urban areas like London had much better odds (one in 394) than people in rural areas like Wales (one in 649) Disregarding other factors such as gender and age, the results revealed that the rate we are mutually attracted to people is 18 per cent. The research also found that while one in three people in the UK is single, 15 per cent of those who class themselves as in a relationship also admit they're on the lookout for a new one. This suggests that a lack of romantic compatibility is a common issue for many couples.          Using online dating services was also found to be a good tactic, increasing the number of suitable people you meet by 17 per cent (stock image)   THE ODDS OF FINDING LOVE DECREASE BASED ON YOUR CRITERIA Factor  Percentage of population matching preference  Number of compatible people in UK remaining    Suitable age range  17%  8,131,275    Mutual attraction  18%  1,467,195    Gender and sexuality  39%  576,994    Compatibility rate  40%  230,798    Relationship status  48%  110,200    Spiritual and religious views  77%  84,440    Total percentage odds 0.18%  84,440    While it may feel harder to find love as you get older, the researchers found that the age group with the best odds were 65-74 year-olds, who have a one in 304 chance. The age group with the toughest odds is 18-24 year-olds, who face chances of meeting the one of just one in 1,024. The results also revealed stark difference between UK regions – those in more urban areas like London had much better odds (one in 394) than people in rural areas like Wales (one in 649). Professor Andreas Kyprianou, a researchers in probability theory at the University of Bath, said: 'This is a fascinating piece of research which takes into account the many different variables that can contribute to the odds of finding love.' Thankfully, the researchers also identified several things you can do to increase your chances of finding love. Saying yes to after work drinks was found to open up a pool of around 75 new people, increasing your chance of finding someone compatible by 16 per cent.          Actions that improve your chance of finding love hilighted by the researchers included talking to people in the gym, which improved your odds by 15 per cent (stock image) And using online dating services was also found to be a good tactic, increasing the number of suitable people you meet by 17 per cent. Dr Steve Carter, Chief Scientist at eHarmony, said: 'We always encourage singles seeking a relationship to socialise and expand their networks. 'The reality is people meet and fall in love all the time "in the wild".          Meeting people through shared hobbies/societies was found to increase your odds of finding love by 11 per cent (stock image) 'Unfortunately, most of us are not so skilled at finding the right person and may often repeat unsuccessful strategies. 'This is because as daters, we mostly choose partners based on elements of attraction largely unrelated to long-term success.'

By Anonymous , April 2nd 2015      Comment      Flag Flagged      http://tcat.tc/1Gkw72Q       Report This Article  What is the issue?      Infringes my copyright     Visually pornographic content     Hateful or weaponized writing     Spam or misleading text   Submit  Cancel         0                               I must admit. I am starting to get desperate. I am ready to settle down and have a family. However, older you get, the harder it is to find a mate because the majority of our population matches up soon after college. Sorry to be a Debbie downer, but it is my opinion that finding a mate that suits your preferences and who is interested in you is very hard indeed.  According to the 2011 U.S. Census, 84% of the Caucasian population between 20 to 24 years of age were not married yet (1). That does not mean that all of these single women were actually “single”. I’m sure some of these individuals were in relationships, but nonetheless they were not married. This percentage of “availability” drops to 54%, and then 30%, and finally 18% between 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 years of age, respectively. By the time an individual turns 40, the likelihood that he/she will ever become married, if the person is single at that time-point, is slim, as the percentage of never married 40-44 year olds is 15%, and remains relatively the same up to 60 years of age. So if you are single by that point, your chances of marriage is not good.  As a 44-year-old Caucasian male, I am one of the 18% of the Caucasian men in my age group (40-44 years of age) that has never been married. I would like to think that I have a lot going for me. I’m decent looking, neatly dressed and tall (6’1), and in fact only 11% of individuals my age are as tall or taller than me (2), and women generally don’t want to be in a relationship in which they are taller than their male partners (3). So I’ve got that covered. I’m of healthy proportions [my body mass index (BMI), which is weight (kg) divided by height (in m 2 ) is normal (22.4 kg/m 2 )] (2), I have an excellent credit rating (812, provided by Equifax), and I am a college professor (PhD). I’m well published and successful in my profession. I ran three Boston Marathons, and I am a 4.0 computer rated USTA tennis player. So I’m fit, too. Theoretically, all these should be attractive qualities for educated females. I’ve spent about $2,000 dollars on matchmaking services to no avail. So, on a lonely Monday night, I have decided to statistically determine the percentage of available women that are in the U.S. who suit my preferences and who may be interested in me.  My preference is a slender, non-smoking , Caucasian woman with perhaps a bachelor’s degree or above, between the ages of 25-39 .  According to the 2011 U.S. Census (1), there are 6,660,000 single Caucasian women (never married) in the U.S between 25 and 39 years of age. There are 1,940,000 divorced women of the same age range (25 to 39). So, let’s add these two together = 8,600,000 (eight million six hundred thousand). That is about 3% of the total U.S. population of 320,400,000 (5) that could be available for marriage.  Now consider that about 18% of these 8,600,000 women have a BMI of 21 or less (6). Since, I usually date women under a BMI of 21, my desired sample would be reduced to about 18% of my preferred female population. That leaves me with 1,548,000 Caucasian single women in the U.S who are single, Caucasian, and of my correct BMI preference.  Now 40% of those women have a college degree (Bachelor’s or more) (7). So, that leaves me with 619,200 available, slender, Caucasian women in the U.S. with a college education and of the right BMI. As 82% of these women are non-smokers (8), that leaves me with 507,744 women or about 6% of 25 to 39 yr old population in the U.S.(0.32% of the total female population in the U.S.).Thus, in any city, 0.32% of the female population would fit my preferences.  Of the 507,744 women available in the U.S., what about certain personality factors, exercising habits, and other “likeness” constructs that I wish for my partner to possess? I would say about 30% of these women would have amicable personality traits and other attributes that would suit my liking. But this is a big guess. So, we are now left with 152,323 women that I would get along with. Now, what percentage of those women would find me attractive? Again, I can’t find any data on the percentage of women that you like who like you too. So I’m going to take an educated guess and say that 20% of these women would also find me attractive.  So, that leaves me with 30,645 women in the U.S. that fit my desires and who find me attractive.  Remember, this statistical estimate is based on women that have never been married or are divorced. But the U.S. Census did not give me insight as to the percentage of those single women who are in “relationships.” Let’s say half of these women are in relationships, so now, we are left with 15,344 women in the U.S. that fit my criteria.  Given that the percentages of lesbians in the U.S., hovers around 4% (9), then that would leave me with a final total allotment of 14,730 women, or 0.17% of available women in the U.S that matches my preferences [(14,730÷8,600,000) x 100]. Good grief.  In a large city like New York (population 8,406,000) there are 226,962 single Caucasian women 25 to 39 yrs of age (0.027 x 8,406,000). This would leave me with 386 women that fit my desires and who find me attractive (0.0017 x 226,962). However, I don’t live in New York. I live in a town that has 751,000 residents. Thus, there would be 20,277 single Caucasian women of my preference 25 to 39 yrs of age (0.027 x 751,000). This would leave me with 35 women in my local area who fit my desires and who find me attractive (0.0017 x 20,277). What are the chances that I bump into one of these 34 women in a population of 751,000? Pretty damn low. Now imagine if I do not want to date women with children and that I want to raise a family of my own without raising someone else’s children (only because I’d like to avoid possible mixed family complications). Well, this would dwindle this population of available, desirable women even further since 33% of women 25 to 39 years of age have no children (10). So, now 0.056% of a given population would be suitable for me (0.0017 x 0.33 = 0.000561). In my area, I would be done to 11 women who fit my desires and who also would find me attractive. The huge task is to figure out where these 11 ladies are, or is it time to move?  Thus, for someone that has selected only five major desirable traits in a mate, I’ve narrowed my selection to 0.17% of the female population. If I want a sixth desirable trait (no previous children), I’m at now 0.056% of the population. So you can see America, I am totally screwed, or rather, NOT screwed (pun intended).  Ladies, as for your own statistical computations you may observe that I also fall into the hard to find group. However, if any of the above mentioned 0.056% (or 0.17%) of the women happen to read this and have the preference for a tall (6’1”), blue eyed, family oriented, left-handed, 44 yrs of age, 6’1, 170 lbs, Caucasian, college professor, never married, no children, I make your search easier; I can be reached at im2exl@gmail.com .

Rachel Riley reveals all  by Rachel Riley        Dating             Ever wondered what the chances are of finding love and how you can stack the odds in your favour? We teamed up with Oxbridge mathematician Rachel Riley to work out the real odds of love   There are almost 23 million UK adults looking for love right now. But despite almost a third of the population looking for true love, finding that special someone can seem almost impossible.  We’re all unique and we’re all looking for something different. People have a range of different personality traits, specific likes and dislikes and, of course, different deal-breakers. These complexities, combined with personal preferences, can make falling in love feel like an uphill task sometimes.  But are the odds of finding love as low as we think? I teamed up with eHarmony to take a mathematical approach to the problem, and my calculations reveal that there are a variety of things that you can do today to stack the odds in your favour.   Calculating the chances of love  Currently, there are 22.6 million people in the UK looking for love. However, only 40% of those people will be the gender that you’re looking for – and you them – bringing the total down to 8.8 million.  Age also has an impact. Most of us feel comfortable dating within a 12-year age range; a 35-year-old would set their preferences between 29 and 41, for example. This immediately removes four-fifths of people from the equation.  And, as much as we don’t like to admit it, looks matter too. eHarmony recently conducted an experiment and found that 18% of people that we’re attracted to will feel the same.  There are other factors to consider too. Your moral outlook, taste in music , and whether you prefer cats or dogs can all reduce or improve the probability that you’ll find someone right for you.  Multiply these together and we’re left with the odds that any one person will find love – one in 562.  To put that in perspective, you have a 1 in 67 chance of having twins, a 1 in 55 chance of becoming a millionaire and there’s a 1 in 500 chance that Simon Cowell will be the next Prime Minister!   How can I improve my odds of finding love?  Don’t panic! There are a whole host of things that you can do to increase your odds of finding love. The secret is meeting more people, or more specifically, meeting more of the right people.  Work is a great place to start. Getting to know your colleagues better may not seem like much but it can drastically improve the probability that you’ll find love. We speak to 15 people at work every day on average, but if they were to introduce you to their friends, you could end up finding someone compatible with you 16% faster.  It’s good news if you’re an avid gym goer too. Not only will a few spinning sessions improve your health, but striking up a conversation with the person sweating next to you will increase your odds of finding a romantic workout partner by 14% over a year.  The odds of finding love online  Giving online dating a go is one of the simplest ways of increasing your likelihood of love. It immediately provides new opportunities as people in new locations become viable options. In fact, every extra mile increases your dating pool by an average of 13%.  And, of course, the experts at eHarmony can help. They’ve made it their life’s work to help people have a better chance of finding long-lasting, happy relationships. It’s all down to compatibility and an algorithm that pairs people on the things that really matter like your core values and personality traits.  In fact, 97% of eHarmony couples hit if off from the very first date.  So, what are you waiting for? Beat the odds and start making changes that’ll really make a difference – it all adds up!

Happy couples don’t stay together by accident. A long-term relationship is the result of hard work and years of continuous self-improvement. The work never ends, but the effort is worth it for couples who really love each other. The common misconception is that the hard work begins only after you have found someone of interest. Our matchmakers have identified 10 attitudes you must fix before even  meeting someone you want to date.    Believing All the Good Ones Are Taken  It’s true that the older we get, the smaller our pool of potential partners becomes. This doesn’t mean there is no one to date – it just means you need to change your strategy. Our matchmakers have an extensive database of singles just waiting for their perfect match to come along, but there are plenty of ways to advocate for yourself, too.  Find hobbies that make you stand out from everyone else. Embrace your individuality, and cultivate behaviors that you would find attractive in someone else.    Fixating on “The One That Got Away”  You can’t commit to someone else if your heart is stuck on an ex. Take the time you need to get over past relationships. Burn old photos, block negative people on social media, and immerse yourself in activities you really enjoy. The more you do for yourself, the easier it will be to heal and reclaim your emotional health.    Thinking You Are Better Off Without a Partner  This is a common defense mechanism people use to keep themselves from getting hurt. Even introverts crave human companionship, so don’t fall into the mindset of thinking you should go it alone. There are many financial, emotional and physical benefits to a relationship, but it is ultimately up to you to decide that you are ready to receive love – and to give it in return.    Failure to Compromise  Some people find the beginning of a relationship is easy, but get frustrated a couple months in. We see this most often in “Type A” personalities who are very cut-and-dry in their personal and professional relationships. The key to working through this rough phase is to give more and take less. Your partner might be pushing back because they are overextended and need a break, or maybe you have placed unreasonable demands on the relationship. Either way, this is a good time to evaluate your priorities and try to sort out the “small stuff” from the things that really matter.    Looking for a 10  People are not trophies. Rating your dates on a scale of one to ten is dehumanizing and signifies that you may need to do some additional soul-searching before finding a happy and fulfilling relationship. Our matchmakers will never arrange an introduction with someone that doesn’t have potential in your life, so give each date an honest chance. Someone may not meet your original expectations at first glance, but if you take the time to talk to them, you may learn that you have a lot in common. There is a reason behind every match, so get through the first date kindly and respectfully. The results might surprise you.    “Knowing” Who You Want to Date  Some people date celebrities and movie stars, but not everyone is happy living with a spouse who has such a demanding travel schedule. Your perfect match could very well be a lawyer, politician, artist, or none of the above. Keep an open mind when looking for love to avoid ruling out perfectly good matches prematurely.    Believing Everyone Wants a Hookup  Our matchmakers predict a shift toward long-term monogamous relationships in 2017. While hook-up culture was pervasive in the past and might linger for a while longer, millennials are growing up and so are the rest of us. As people get older they naturally desire more mature relationships centered on stability and companionship. We anticipate record numbers of people seeking commitment in 2017.    Overbooking Your Schedule  You might have an amazing career, but you will enjoy that success alone if you don’t slow down to enjoy dinner with the attractive date our matchmakers picked out for you. Practice saying “no” when meetings and professional obligations begin to encroach on your personal life. Romance is important. Make a commitment to invest in yourself and your desires.    Assuming they’re All the Same  It’s a mistake to assume your preferred gender always adheres to the stereotypes society has presented. Not all men are cheaters and not all women are gold diggers. There are honest people out there, but they generally won’t be bothered with anyone who goes into the date with a negative attitude. Let each individual person make their own impression without applying preconceived ideas to the date.    Giving Up  There is nothing worse than completely giving up on your love life because you have been hurt in the past or no longer believe you have a compatible match. Our matchmakers have seen love stories come true too many times to believe someone is simply fated to be alone.    Don’t let negative attitudes hold you back from the best relationship of your life. Work with a matchmaker to correct your misconceptions about love and prepare for a better future. Contact us today to learn more.

While following our hearts to find "the one" is a very romantic notion, using data might be a better method to achieving long-term relationship satisfaction. At least, that's what Ty Tashiro, author of The Science of Happily Ever After: What Really Matters in the Quest for Enduring Love , and Lori Gottlieb, author of Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough , suggest to host and RealSimple.com editor Lori Leibovich on this week's episode of "The Labor of Love." Leibovich talks to the relationship experts about the traits we should be prioritizing in our partners, how to decipher between making a smart choice and settling, and why online dating is a double-edged sword. Below, five of their tips for finding long-lasting love. 1.  (Re-)Consider Your Wishlist. We all have a list of traits we're looking for in a partner, but we often prioritize ones that won't set us up for long-term happiness. Instead of focusing on attractiveness and socioeconomic status, for example, we should be looking for agreeableness—someone who is kind with no strings attached, Tashiro says.      2. Be Open-Minded . While it's okay to have a certain "type," agree to at least meet people once for coffee. "Once you start ruling out people based on certain characteristics, you start whittling down the pool of people available pretty quickly," Tashiro says. Only choosing to date men who are six feet tall, for example, rules out 80 percent of your potential options. 3. Don't Expect Love at First Sight. Our society indulges the idea that love has to look a certain way—and that when we meet the partner of our dreams, we're going to fall head over heels immediately. But the reality for most married couples, Gottlieb says, is that it likely took them a little time before they had that "aha" moment. 4. Talk It Out. Discuss the more "un-romantic" topics—such as money, children, and work—before walking down the aisle, which will ensure you both have similar ideas about how you want your lives to go. Pre-marital counseling is one way to do this. 5. Get Opinions From Family and Friends. Many people tend to ignore red flags, choosing instead to focus on the positives in the relationship. But research has shown friends and family can spot potential problems, and are often a better judge of the relationship than you are.

Who knew?! Tinder’s recently released data busts some dating myths and shows that there are tons of upsides to dating online, including the fact that you’re actually more likely to find love through your screen than IRL.        There’s a common perception that committed dating has been killed off by apps like Tinder, but the opposite appears to be true. In their national survey of daters between 18 and 35 years of age, Tinder researchers found that nearly three-quarters (74 percent) of online daters have been in at least one committed relationship. This number drops to less than half (49 percent) for those who date offline.  The data also reveals that fidelity is really important to both online and offline daters, but slightly moreso for the online crowd. Also, 93 percent of people who date online said fidelity was somewhat or very important to them, compared with 90 percent among offline-only daters.  Not only are people who are interested in committed relationships much more likely to be seeking a relationship online, but folks who date online are much less judgmental than people who only date offline. Tinder’s data shows that 20 percent of offline daters who wouldn’t consider dating online consider different career aspirations to be a total deal-breaker for potential new partners. Only 13 percent of online daters said the same.        Anyone who has spent some time on Tinder knows that the number of people “in your area” who are looking to meet someone can be overwhelming — one could easily swipe left and right for hours. But Tinder found that the number of available people to date doesn’t stop people who use the app from committing to someone they like. Only nine percent of Tinder users surveyed said they had a hard time committing because of dating options, white 44 percent of online daters overall and 42 percent of offline daters said the same.  We spoke to two women who found themselves in long-term relationships after swiping right a few years ago on Tinder.   Ilana, who is 26 and lives in New York, tells us she wasn’t necessarily looking for love when she found her partner of nearly three years on Tinder — she just wanted to find someone who would treat her well. While she was open to a relationship, she says she was very surprised to find herself in a long-term relationship. In fact, she was right about to delete the app when she found her love.  Finding love on Tinder also came as a big surprise to Audra, who says she found her partner of eight months while she was bored and swiping through because she was jet-lagged from a trip. Before that, she tells us she’d only use Tinder to find dates while she was traveling.        In its coverage of Tinder’s new data, the New York Times notes that the findings still require additional research before anyone can know how accurate they are or how broadly they should be applied. The Times notes that by surveying only millennials, a group that is more prone to use online dating, the results comparing online to offline daters could be skewed.  But of course, millennials use dating apps more than any other age group, so surveying millennials about this subject is a good start, at a minimum (Tinder is also the most popular dating app overall for any age group). Further, Tinder’s findings jive with previous research on marriage and online dating. According to a 2013 report from the University of Chicago, two-thirds of marriages between 2005 and 2012 were the result of relationships that started online.  Nobody is here to argue that dating in any format is easy. It’s messy, can be difficult, and there’s always the chance that it’ll end in heartbreak, but against the stereotypes, the data shows that plenty of people are finding the real deal online.

A new study has found that the chance of finding love on a given day is just 1 in 562 if you leave it entirely to fate. But the good news is that there are several things you can do to improve those odds, including saying yes to after-work drinks, and joining online dating services. Scroll down for video          A new study by researchers, including celebrity mathematician, Rachel Riley, has found that the chance of finding love on a given day is just 1 in 562 if you leave it entirely to fate   ACTIONS THAT IMPROVE YOUR CHANCE OF FINDING LOVE Factor  People added to dating pool monthly on average  Positive impact on odds    Meeting people via online dating site  8  17%    Meeting colleagues and friends of colleagues  6  16%    Talking to people at the gym  7  15%    Meeting people through shared hobbies/societies  5  11%    Talking to people at clubs/bars  4  9%    Meeting friends of friends  2  4%    Being set up by family members  0.4  1%    Talking to people in the gym was found to improve your odds of meeting 'the one' by 15 per cent. Saying yes to after-work drinks boosted your chance by 16 per cent. The biggest boost to your odds was found to be meeting people via online dating, with a 17 per cent jump. Meeting friends of friends (four per cent) and being set up by family members (one per cent) were found to be the least effective routes to finding love. The researchers, from the University of Bath, calculated the odds of falling in love with the help of celebrity mathematician Rachel Riley. The researchers based their calculations on 18 key factors, including your location, desired age, physical attractiveness and relationship status. Sadly, they found that just 84,440 people in the UK fit the average person's romantic requirements from an adult population of over 47 million. This is the equivalent of just one in in 562. Ms Riley said: 'When it comes down to it, love really is a numbers game.    RELATED ARTICLES   Previous  1  Next        Why onions make us cry: Researchers uncover the chemistry...

'But, as our data suggests, the odds of love can drastically diminish when we get too prescriptive about age, location, looks, and even pet preferences!' Analysing their results further, the researchers, who worked with eHarmony as part of the study, found that the biggest impact on your chances of finding love is age. The average UK singleton is most likely to be looking for a partner aged between 35 and 47.          The researchers found that just 84,440 people in the UK fit the average person's romantic requirements from an adult population of over 47 million (stock image) And according to figures from the Office of National Statistics, that leaves just 17 per cent of the population as an option. Physical attraction was second in importance, which was uncovered by a photo gallery experiment. Researchers asked members of the public to rate images of a variety of people based on looks.          Saying yes to after work drinks was found to open up a pool of around 75 new people, increasing your chance of finding someone compatible by 16 per cent (stock image)  KEY FINDINGS - 84,440 people in the UK fit the average person's romantic requirements from an adult population of over 47 million - The average UK singleton is most likely to be looking for a partner aged between 35 and 47 - The rate we are mutually attracted to people is 18 per cent - The age group with the best odds were 65-74 year-olds, who have a one in 304 chance - The age group with the toughest odds is 18-24 year-olds, who face chances of meeting the one of just one in 1,024 - Those in more urban areas like London had much better odds (one in 394) than people in rural areas like Wales (one in 649) Disregarding other factors such as gender and age, the results revealed that the rate we are mutually attracted to people is 18 per cent. The research also found that while one in three people in the UK is single, 15 per cent of those who class themselves as in a relationship also admit they're on the lookout for a new one. This suggests that a lack of romantic compatibility is a common issue for many couples.          Using online dating services was also found to be a good tactic, increasing the number of suitable people you meet by 17 per cent (stock image)   THE ODDS OF FINDING LOVE DECREASE BASED ON YOUR CRITERIA Factor  Percentage of population matching preference  Number of compatible people in UK remaining    Suitable age range  17%  8,131,275    Mutual attraction  18%  1,467,195    Gender and sexuality  39%  576,994    Compatibility rate  40%  230,798    Relationship status  48%  110,200    Spiritual and religious views  77%  84,440    Total percentage odds 0.18%  84,440    While it may feel harder to find love as you get older, the researchers found that the age group with the best odds were 65-74 year-olds, who have a one in 304 chance. The age group with the toughest odds is 18-24 year-olds, who face chances of meeting the one of just one in 1,024. The results also revealed stark difference between UK regions – those in more urban areas like London had much better odds (one in 394) than people in rural areas like Wales (one in 649). Professor Andreas Kyprianou, a researchers in probability theory at the University of Bath, said: 'This is a fascinating piece of research which takes into account the many different variables that can contribute to the odds of finding love.' Thankfully, the researchers also identified several things you can do to increase your chances of finding love. Saying yes to after work drinks was found to open up a pool of around 75 new people, increasing your chance of finding someone compatible by 16 per cent.          Actions that improve your chance of finding love hilighted by the researchers included talking to people in the gym, which improved your odds by 15 per cent (stock image) And using online dating services was also found to be a good tactic, increasing the number of suitable people you meet by 17 per cent. Dr Steve Carter, Chief Scientist at eHarmony, said: 'We always encourage singles seeking a relationship to socialise and expand their networks. 'The reality is people meet and fall in love all the time "in the wild".

By Anonymous , April 2nd 2015      Comment      Flag Flagged      http://tcat.tc/1Gkw72Q       Report This Article  What is the issue?      Infringes my copyright     Visually pornographic content     Hateful or weaponized writing     Spam or misleading text   Submit  Cancel         0                               I must admit. I am starting to get desperate. I am ready to settle down and have a family. However, older you get, the harder it is to find a mate because the majority of our population matches up soon after college. Sorry to be a Debbie downer, but it is my opinion that finding a mate that suits your preferences and who is interested in you is very hard indeed.  According to the 2011 U.S. Census, 84% of the Caucasian population between 20 to 24 years of age were not married yet (1). That does not mean that all of these single women were actually “single”. I’m sure some of these individuals were in relationships, but nonetheless they were not married. This percentage of “availability” drops to 54%, and then 30%, and finally 18% between 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 years of age, respectively. By the time an individual turns 40, the likelihood that he/she will ever become married, if the person is single at that time-point, is slim, as the percentage of never married 40-44 year olds is 15%, and remains relatively the same up to 60 years of age. So if you are single by that point, your chances of marriage is not good.  As a 44-year-old Caucasian male, I am one of the 18% of the Caucasian men in my age group (40-44 years of age) that has never been married. I would like to think that I have a lot going for me. I’m decent looking, neatly dressed and tall (6’1), and in fact only 11% of individuals my age are as tall or taller than me (2), and women generally don’t want to be in a relationship in which they are taller than their male partners (3). So I’ve got that covered. I’m of healthy proportions [my body mass index (BMI), which is weight (kg) divided by height (in m 2 ) is normal (22.4 kg/m 2 )] (2), I have an excellent credit rating (812, provided by Equifax), and I am a college professor (PhD). I’m well published and successful in my profession. I ran three Boston Marathons, and I am a 4.0 computer rated USTA tennis player. So I’m fit, too. Theoretically, all these should be attractive qualities for educated females. I’ve spent about $2,000 dollars on matchmaking services to no avail. So, on a lonely Monday night, I have decided to statistically determine the percentage of available women that are in the U.S. who suit my preferences and who may be interested in me.  My preference is a slender, non-smoking , Caucasian woman with perhaps a bachelor’s degree or above, between the ages of 25-39 .  According to the 2011 U.S. Census (1), there are 6,660,000 single Caucasian women (never married) in the U.S between 25 and 39 years of age. There are 1,940,000 divorced women of the same age range (25 to 39). So, let’s add these two together = 8,600,000 (eight million six hundred thousand). That is about 3% of the total U.S. population of 320,400,000 (5) that could be available for marriage.  Now consider that about 18% of these 8,600,000 women have a BMI of 21 or less (6). Since, I usually date women under a BMI of 21, my desired sample would be reduced to about 18% of my preferred female population. That leaves me with 1,548,000 Caucasian single women in the U.S who are single, Caucasian, and of my correct BMI preference.  Now 40% of those women have a college degree (Bachelor’s or more) (7). So, that leaves me with 619,200 available, slender, Caucasian women in the U.S. with a college education and of the right BMI. As 82% of these women are non-smokers (8), that leaves me with 507,744 women or about 6% of 25 to 39 yr old population in the U.S.(0.32% of the total female population in the U.S.).Thus, in any city, 0.32% of the female population would fit my preferences.  Of the 507,744 women available in the U.S., what about certain personality factors, exercising habits, and other “likeness” constructs that I wish for my partner to possess? I would say about 30% of these women would have amicable personality traits and other attributes that would suit my liking. But this is a big guess. So, we are now left with 152,323 women that I would get along with. Now, what percentage of those women would find me attractive? Again, I can’t find any data on the percentage of women that you like who like you too. So I’m going to take an educated guess and say that 20% of these women would also find me attractive.  So, that leaves me with 30,645 women in the U.S. that fit my desires and who find me attractive.  Remember, this statistical estimate is based on women that have never been married or are divorced. But the U.S. Census did not give me insight as to the percentage of those single women who are in “relationships.” Let’s say half of these women are in relationships, so now, we are left with 15,344 women in the U.S. that fit my criteria.  Given that the percentages of lesbians in the U.S., hovers around 4% (9), then that would leave me with a final total allotment of 14,730 women, or 0.17% of available women in the U.S that matches my preferences [(14,730÷8,600,000) x 100]. Good grief.  In a large city like New York (population 8,406,000) there are 226,962 single Caucasian women 25 to 39 yrs of age (0.027 x 8,406,000). This would leave me with 386 women that fit my desires and who find me attractive (0.0017 x 226,962). However, I don’t live in New York. I live in a town that has 751,000 residents. Thus, there would be 20,277 single Caucasian women of my preference 25 to 39 yrs of age (0.027 x 751,000). This would leave me with 35 women in my local area who fit my desires and who find me attractive (0.0017 x 20,277). What are the chances that I bump into one of these 34 women in a population of 751,000? Pretty damn low. Now imagine if I do not want to date women with children and that I want to raise a family of my own without raising someone else’s children (only because I’d like to avoid possible mixed family complications). Well, this would dwindle this population of available, desirable women even further since 33% of women 25 to 39 years of age have no children (10). So, now 0.056% of a given population would be suitable for me (0.0017 x 0.33 = 0.000561). In my area, I would be done to 11 women who fit my desires and who also would find me attractive. The huge task is to figure out where these 11 ladies are, or is it time to move?  Thus, for someone that has selected only five major desirable traits in a mate, I’ve narrowed my selection to 0.17% of the female population. If I want a sixth desirable trait (no previous children), I’m at now 0.056% of the population. So you can see America, I am totally screwed, or rather, NOT screwed (pun intended).  Ladies, as for your own statistical computations you may observe that I also fall into the hard to find group. However, if any of the above mentioned 0.056% (or 0.17%) of the women happen to read this and have the preference for a tall (6’1”), blue eyed, family oriented, left-handed, 44 yrs of age, 6’1, 170 lbs, Caucasian, college professor, never married, no children, I make your search easier; I can be reached at im2exl@gmail.com .

Rachel Riley reveals all  by Rachel Riley        Dating             Ever wondered what the chances are of finding love and how you can stack the odds in your favour? We teamed up with Oxbridge mathematician Rachel Riley to work out the real odds of love   There are almost 23 million UK adults looking for love right now. But despite almost a third of the population looking for true love, finding that special someone can seem almost impossible.  We’re all unique and we’re all looking for something different. People have a range of different personality traits, specific likes and dislikes and, of course, different deal-breakers. These complexities, combined with personal preferences, can make falling in love feel like an uphill task sometimes.  But are the odds of finding love as low as we think? I teamed up with eHarmony to take a mathematical approach to the problem, and my calculations reveal that there are a variety of things that you can do today to stack the odds in your favour.   Calculating the chances of love  Currently, there are 22.6 million people in the UK looking for love. However, only 40% of those people will be the gender that you’re looking for – and you them – bringing the total down to 8.8 million.  Age also has an impact. Most of us feel comfortable dating within a 12-year age range; a 35-year-old would set their preferences between 29 and 41, for example. This immediately removes four-fifths of people from the equation.  And, as much as we don’t like to admit it, looks matter too. eHarmony recently conducted an experiment and found that 18% of people that we’re attracted to will feel the same.  There are other factors to consider too. Your moral outlook, taste in music , and whether you prefer cats or dogs can all reduce or improve the probability that you’ll find someone right for you.  Multiply these together and we’re left with the odds that any one person will find love – one in 562.  To put that in perspective, you have a 1 in 67 chance of having twins, a 1 in 55 chance of becoming a millionaire and there’s a 1 in 500 chance that Simon Cowell will be the next Prime Minister!   How can I improve my odds of finding love?  Don’t panic! There are a whole host of things that you can do to increase your odds of finding love. The secret is meeting more people, or more specifically, meeting more of the right people.  Work is a great place to start. Getting to know your colleagues better may not seem like much but it can drastically improve the probability that you’ll find love. We speak to 15 people at work every day on average, but if they were to introduce you to their friends, you could end up finding someone compatible with you 16% faster.  It’s good news if you’re an avid gym goer too. Not only will a few spinning sessions improve your health, but striking up a conversation with the person sweating next to you will increase your odds of finding a romantic workout partner by 14% over a year.  The odds of finding love online  Giving online dating a go is one of the simplest ways of increasing your likelihood of love. It immediately provides new opportunities as people in new locations become viable options. In fact, every extra mile increases your dating pool by an average of 13%.  And, of course, the experts at eHarmony can help. They’ve made it their life’s work to help people have a better chance of finding long-lasting, happy relationships. It’s all down to compatibility and an algorithm that pairs people on the things that really matter like your core values and personality traits.  In fact, 97% of eHarmony couples hit if off from the very first date.  So, what are you waiting for? Beat the odds and start making changes that’ll really make a difference – it all adds up!

Happy couples don’t stay together by accident. A long-term relationship is the result of hard work and years of continuous self-improvement. The work never ends, but the effort is worth it for couples who really love each other. The common misconception is that the hard work begins only after you have found someone of interest. Our matchmakers have identified 10 attitudes you must fix before even  meeting someone you want to date.    Believing All the Good Ones Are Taken  It’s true that the older we get, the smaller our pool of potential partners becomes. This doesn’t mean there is no one to date – it just means you need to change your strategy. Our matchmakers have an extensive database of singles just waiting for their perfect match to come along, but there are plenty of ways to advocate for yourself, too.  Find hobbies that make you stand out from everyone else. Embrace your individuality, and cultivate behaviors that you would find attractive in someone else.    Fixating on “The One That Got Away”  You can’t commit to someone else if your heart is stuck on an ex. Take the time you need to get over past relationships. Burn old photos, block negative people on social media, and immerse yourself in activities you really enjoy. The more you do for yourself, the easier it will be to heal and reclaim your emotional health.    Thinking You Are Better Off Without a Partner  This is a common defense mechanism people use to keep themselves from getting hurt. Even introverts crave human companionship, so don’t fall into the mindset of thinking you should go it alone. There are many financial, emotional and physical benefits to a relationship, but it is ultimately up to you to decide that you are ready to receive love – and to give it in return.    Failure to Compromise  Some people find the beginning of a relationship is easy, but get frustrated a couple months in. We see this most often in “Type A” personalities who are very cut-and-dry in their personal and professional relationships. The key to working through this rough phase is to give more and take less. Your partner might be pushing back because they are overextended and need a break, or maybe you have placed unreasonable demands on the relationship. Either way, this is a good time to evaluate your priorities and try to sort out the “small stuff” from the things that really matter.    Looking for a 10  People are not trophies. Rating your dates on a scale of one to ten is dehumanizing and signifies that you may need to do some additional soul-searching before finding a happy and fulfilling relationship. Our matchmakers will never arrange an introduction with someone that doesn’t have potential in your life, so give each date an honest chance. Someone may not meet your original expectations at first glance, but if you take the time to talk to them, you may learn that you have a lot in common. There is a reason behind every match, so get through the first date kindly and respectfully. The results might surprise you.    “Knowing” Who You Want to Date  Some people date celebrities and movie stars, but not everyone is happy living with a spouse who has such a demanding travel schedule. Your perfect match could very well be a lawyer, politician, artist, or none of the above. Keep an open mind when looking for love to avoid ruling out perfectly good matches prematurely.    Believing Everyone Wants a Hookup  Our matchmakers predict a shift toward long-term monogamous relationships in 2017. While hook-up culture was pervasive in the past and might linger for a while longer, millennials are growing up and so are the rest of us. As people get older they naturally desire more mature relationships centered on stability and companionship. We anticipate record numbers of people seeking commitment in 2017.    Overbooking Your Schedule  You might have an amazing career, but you will enjoy that success alone if you don’t slow down to enjoy dinner with the attractive date our matchmakers picked out for you. Practice saying “no” when meetings and professional obligations begin to encroach on your personal life. Romance is important. Make a commitment to invest in yourself and your desires.    Assuming they’re All the Same  It’s a mistake to assume your preferred gender always adheres to the stereotypes society has presented. Not all men are cheaters and not all women are gold diggers. There are honest people out there, but they generally won’t be bothered with anyone who goes into the date with a negative attitude. Let each individual person make their own impression without applying preconceived ideas to the date.    Giving Up  There is nothing worse than completely giving up on your love life because you have been hurt in the past or no longer believe you have a compatible match. Our matchmakers have seen love stories come true too many times to believe someone is simply fated to be alone.    Don’t let negative attitudes hold you back from the best relationship of your life.

While following our hearts to find "the one" is a very romantic notion, using data might be a better method to achieving long-term relationship satisfaction. At least, that's what Ty Tashiro, author of The Science of Happily Ever After: What Really Matters in the Quest for Enduring Love , and Lori Gottlieb, author of Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough , suggest to host and RealSimple.com editor Lori Leibovich on this week's episode of "The Labor of Love." Leibovich talks to the relationship experts about the traits we should be prioritizing in our partners, how to decipher between making a smart choice and settling, and why online dating is a double-edged sword. Below, five of their tips for finding long-lasting love. 1.  (Re-)Consider Your Wishlist. We all have a list of traits we're looking for in a partner, but we often prioritize ones that won't set us up for long-term happiness. Instead of focusing on attractiveness and socioeconomic status, for example, we should be looking for agreeableness—someone who is kind with no strings attached, Tashiro says.      2. Be Open-Minded . While it's okay to have a certain "type," agree to at least meet people once for coffee. "Once you start ruling out people based on certain characteristics, you start whittling down the pool of people available pretty quickly," Tashiro says. Only choosing to date men who are six feet tall, for example, rules out 80 percent of your potential options. 3. Don't Expect Love at First Sight. Our society indulges the idea that love has to look a certain way—and that when we meet the partner of our dreams, we're going to fall head over heels immediately. But the reality for most married couples, Gottlieb says, is that it likely took them a little time before they had that "aha" moment. 4. Talk It Out. Discuss the more "un-romantic" topics—such as money, children, and work—before walking down the aisle, which will ensure you both have similar ideas about how you want your lives to go. Pre-marital counseling is one way to do this. 5. Get Opinions From Family and Friends. Many people tend to ignore red flags, choosing instead to focus on the positives in the relationship. But research has shown friends and family can spot potential problems, and are often a better judge of the relationship than you are.

Who knew?! Tinder’s recently released data busts some dating myths and shows that there are tons of upsides to dating online, including the fact that you’re actually more likely to find love through your screen than IRL.        There’s a common perception that committed dating has been killed off by apps like Tinder, but the opposite appears to be true. In their national survey of daters between 18 and 35 years of age, Tinder researchers found that nearly three-quarters (74 percent) of online daters have been in at least one committed relationship. This number drops to less than half (49 percent) for those who date offline.  The data also reveals that fidelity is really important to both online and offline daters, but slightly moreso for the online crowd. Also, 93 percent of people who date online said fidelity was somewhat or very important to them, compared with 90 percent among offline-only daters.  Not only are people who are interested in committed relationships much more likely to be seeking a relationship online, but folks who date online are much less judgmental than people who only date offline. Tinder’s data shows that 20 percent of offline daters who wouldn’t consider dating online consider different career aspirations to be a total deal-breaker for potential new partners. Only 13 percent of online daters said the same.        Anyone who has spent some time on Tinder knows that the number of people “in your area” who are looking to meet someone can be overwhelming — one could easily swipe left and right for hours. But Tinder found that the number of available people to date doesn’t stop people who use the app from committing to someone they like. Only nine percent of Tinder users surveyed said they had a hard time committing because of dating options, white 44 percent of online daters overall and 42 percent of offline daters said the same.  We spoke to two women who found themselves in long-term relationships after swiping right a few years ago on Tinder.   Ilana, who is 26 and lives in New York, tells us she wasn’t necessarily looking for love when she found her partner of nearly three years on Tinder — she just wanted to find someone who would treat her well. While she was open to a relationship, she says she was very surprised to find herself in a long-term relationship. In fact, she was right about to delete the app when she found her love.  Finding love on Tinder also came as a big surprise to Audra, who says she found her partner of eight months while she was bored and swiping through because she was jet-lagged from a trip. Before that, she tells us she’d only use Tinder to find dates while she was traveling.        In its coverage of Tinder’s new data, the New York Times notes that the findings still require additional research before anyone can know how accurate they are or how broadly they should be applied. The Times notes that by surveying only millennials, a group that is more prone to use online dating, the results comparing online to offline daters could be skewed.  But of course, millennials use dating apps more than any other age group, so surveying millennials about this subject is a good start, at a minimum (Tinder is also the most popular dating app overall for any age group). Further, Tinder’s findings jive with previous research on marriage and online dating. According to a 2013 report from the University of Chicago, two-thirds of marriages between 2005 and 2012 were the result of relationships that started online.  Nobody is here to argue that dating in any format is easy. It’s messy, can be difficult, and there’s always the chance that it’ll end in heartbreak, but against the stereotypes, the data shows that plenty of people are finding the real deal online.
