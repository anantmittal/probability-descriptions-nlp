Default loss rate
The recovery rate is defined as 1 minus the LGD, the share of an asset that is recovered when a borrower defaults. Loss given default is facility-specific because such losses are generally understood to be influenced by key transaction characteristics such as the presence of collateral and the degree of subordination.
